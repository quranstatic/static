He said to his family, “Stay here! I perceive fire, may be I will bring to you some news from it or a brand from the fire that you may warm yourselves.”","28:30":"So when he came to it, he was called from the tree in the blessed spot of the right (hand) side of the valley, that, “O Musa! I am Allah, the Fosterer of the worlds.”","28:31":"And that, “Cast down your staff,” then when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned back retreating and did not return. “O Musa! come near and do not fear, you are certainly of those who are secure","28:32":"put your hand into (the opening of) your bosom, it will come out white without (this effect being due to some) illness, and draw your armpit towards yourself (to get rid) of the fear.

I have killed a person from among them, so I fear that they will kill me","28:34":"and my brother Harun, he is more eloquent than me in speech, so send him with me as a helper to confirm me, I fear that they will deny me.”","28:35":"He said, “We will strengthen your arm with your brother, and assign authority to both of you, so that they will not be able to advance towards you because of Our signs. Both of you and those who follow you two will be victorious.”","28:36":"So when Musa came to them with Our clear signs, they said, “This is nothing but forged magic and we have not heard of this among our ancient fathers.”","28:37":"And Musa said, “My Fosterer knows best about him who comes with guidance from Him and foe whom is the final (good) home.

So those are their houses, they have not been dwelt in after them except a little, and We were the inheritors","28:59":"And your Fosterer did not destroy the towns unless He had raised in their capital a messenger who read to them Our signs, and We do not destroy the towns unless their people are unjust","28:60":"And things which you are give are a provision of the life of this world and its adornment, and that which is with Allah is better and more lasting.

news","78:3":"concerning which they disagree","78:4":"No, they will come to know","78:5":"Again, no, they will come to know","78:6":"Did We not make the earth habitable","78:7":"and the mountains pegs","78:8":"And We created you in pairs","78:9":"And We made your sleep for rest","78:10":"And We made the night a covering","78:11":"And We made the day (for earning) livelihood","78:12":"And We built above you seven strong ones","78:13":"And We made (the sun) a burning lamp","78:14":"And We sent down from the rain-clouds, torrential rain","78:15":"that We may bring forth through it grain and vegetation","78:16":"and dense gardens","78:17":"The day of decision is certainly fixed","78:18":"The day it will be blown into the trumpet (or structure of the universe) you will come forth in

signs with a denial","78:29":"and We have computed everything in a record","78:30":"So taste (the punishment), and We will not increase for you anything except punishment","78:31":"For those who guard (against evil there) is certainly an achievement","78:32":"Gardens and vineyards","78:33":"and young women of equal age","78:34":"and a full cup","78:35":"They will hear therein neither useless talk

aright","78:39":"That's a real day (not fictitious), so whoever wills let him seek a home near his Fosterer","78:40":"We warn you of a punishment that is near, the day man will see that which his hands had sent forth and the infidel will say, “I wish I were dust.”","79:1":"By those who pull out getting drowned (going deep to the last limit)","79:2":"and those who untie, releasing","79:3":"and

succeeding one will follow it","79:8":"on that day hearts will palpitate","79:9":"their looks will be cast down","79:10":"They say, “Shall we be restored to our first state","79:11":"even when we have become rotten bones?”","79:12":"They say, “Then this would be a return of loss.”","79:13":"So it will only be a single shout","79:14":"when they will be awake","79:15":"Has the story of Musa come to you","79:16":"When his Fosterer called him in the holy valley of Tuwa (saying)","79:17":"Go to Firawn, he has certainly rebelled","79:18":"then say to him, “ Have you the inclination to purify

(earth) its water and its pasture","79:32":"and He firmly anchored the mountains","79:33":"A provision for you and for your cattle","79:34":"So when the great predominating calamity comes","79:35":"the day man will recollect what he earnestly strove after","79:36":"And the hell will be made manifest for him who sees","79:37":"So as for him who rebelled","79:38":"and preferred the life of this world","79:39":"then hell will certainly be his home","79:40":"And as for him who feared to stand before his Fosterer and restrained himself from evil desire","79:41":"then the garden

(belongs the knowledge of) the ultimate time of its happening","79:45":"You are a warner only for him who fears it","79:46":"The day they see it, for them it will be as if they had not stayed (in their graves or this world) except for an evening or a morning of it","80:1":"He (Muhammed) frowned and turned his back","80:2":"that the blind man came to him","80:3":"And what will make you realize that he might have purified himself","80:4":"or be reminded, so that (your) reminding might have profited him","80:5":"As for him who is carefree (wealthy)","80:6":"to him then, you pay attention","80:7":"And if he does not purify himself, the responsibility is not on you","80:8":"And as for him who comes to you striving hard","80:9":"and he fears","80:10":"from him you are

your Fosterer that you will be pleased","93:6":"Did He not find you an orphan, then give you shelter","93:7":"and find you wandering then guide you","93:8":"and find you poor then make you free of want","93:9":"So as for the orphan do not oppress (him)","93:10":"and as for the beggar do not drive him away","93:11":"and as for the favour of your Fosterer, do proclaim","94:1":"Did We not expand for you your bosom","94:2":"and relieve you of your burden","94:3":"which weighed down your back","94:4":"and exalted for you your mention","94:5":"So certainly with difficulty is ease","94:6":"Certainly with difficulty is ease","94:7":"So when you are free, then strive","94:8":"and turn your attention towards your Fosterer","95:1":"By the fig (or the place Tiin where Nuh’s
