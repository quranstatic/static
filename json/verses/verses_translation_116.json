We have left out nothing in the Book. Then to their Lord shall they all be gathered together","6:39":"Those who have rejected Our signs are deaf and dumb, in utter darkness. Whom God wills He lets go astray and whom He wills He places on the right path","6:40":"Say,`Will you tell me if the punishment of God come or there come upon you the Hour, will you call upon any other than God, if you are truthful","6:41":"Nay, but on Him alone will you call; then will He remove, if He pleases, that which you call on Him to remove, and you will forget what you associate with Him","6:42":"And indeed We sent Messengers to peoples before thee; then We afflicted them with poverty and adversity that they might humble themselves","6:43":"Why, then, when Our punishment came upon them, did they not humble themselves? But their hearts were hardened all the more and Satan made all that they did seem fair to them","6:44":"When they forgot that with which they had been admonished, and We opened unto them the gates of all things, till, even as they were rejoicing in what they were given, We seized them suddenly, and lo! they were in utter despair","6:45":"So the last remnant of the people who did wrong was cut off; and all praise belongs to God, the Lord of all the worlds","6:46":"Say, 'Will you tell me, if God should take away your hearing and your sight, and seal up your hearts, who is the god other than God who can bring it back to you?'

And admonish people thereby lest a soul be consigned to perdition for what it has earned. It shall have no helper nor intercessor beside God; and even if it offer every ransom it shall not be accepted from it. These are they who have been delivered over to destruction for their own acts. They will have a drink of boiling water and a grievous punishment, because they disbelieved","6:71":"Say, 'Shall we call beside God, upon that which can neither profit us nor harm us, and shall we be turn back on our heels after God guided us? -- Like one whom the evil ones entice away, leaving him bewildered in the land, and who has companions who call him to guidance, saying, 'Come to us.'

He answered, 'We will ruthlessly slay their sons and let their women live. And surely we are dominant over them","7:128":"Moses said to his people, 'Seek help from God and be steadfast. Verily the earth is God's; He gives it as a heritage to whomsoever He pleases of His servants and the good end is for the God-fearing","7:129":"They replied, 'We were persecuted before thou camest to us and even after thou camest to us.' He said, 'Your Lord is about to destroy your enemy and make you rulers in the land, that He may see how you act","7:130":"And We afflicted Pharaoh's people with years of draught and scarcity of fruits, that they might take heed","7:131":"But whenever good befell them, they said, 'This is for us.' And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed the evil fortune to Moses and those with him. Now, surely, the cause of their evil fortune was with God. But most of them know not","7:132":"And they said, 'Whatever Sign thou mayest bring to us to bewitch us with, we will not submit to thee","7:133":"Then We sent upon them the storm and the locust and the lice and the frogs and the blood -- clear Signs; but they behaved proudly and were a sinful people","7:134":"And when there fell upon them the punishment, they said, 'O Moses, pray for us to thy Lord according to that which He has promised to thee. If thou remove from us the punishment, we will surely believe thee and we will surely send with thee the Children of Israel","7:135":"But when We removed from them the punishment for a term which they were to reach, lo! they broke their promise","7:136":"So We took vengeance upon them and drowned them in the sea, because they treated Our Signs as lies and were heedless of them","7:137":"And We caused the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof, which We blessed. And the gracious word of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because they were steadfast; and We utterly destroyed all that Pharaoh and his people has built and all that they had erected","7:138":"And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they came to a people who were devoted to their idols.

He said, 'Surely you are an ignorant people","7:139":"Surely, all that these people are engaged in shall be destroyed, and vain shall be all that they do","7:140":"He said, 'Shall I seek for you a god other than God, while He has exalted you above all peoples","7:141":"And remember the time when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people who afflicted you with grievous torment, slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. And therein was a great trial for you from your Lord","7:142":"And We made Moses a promise of thirty nights and supplemented them with ten. Thus the period appointed by his Lord was completed -- forty nights. And Moses said to his brother, Aaron, 'Take my place amongst my people in my absence, and manage them well and follow not the way of the mischief-makers","7:143":"And when Moses came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, 'My Lord, show Thyself to me that I may look at Thee.' God replied, 'Thou shalt not see Me. But look at the mountain; and if it remains in its place, then thou shalt see Me.' And when his Lord manifested Himself on the mountain, He broke it into pieces and Moses fell down unconscious. And when he recovered, he said, 'Holy art Thou, I turn to thee and I am the first to believe","7:144":"God said, 'O Moses, I have chosen thee above the people of thy time by My Messages and by My Word. So take firm hold of that which I have given thee and be of the grateful","7:145":"And We wrote for him upon the Tablets about everything an admonition and an explanation of all things. 'So hold them fast and bid thy people follow the best thereof. Soon shall I show you the abode of the transgressors","7:146":"I shall soon turn away from My Signs those who behave proudly in the land in an unjust manner; and even if they see all the Signs, they will not believe therein; and if they see the way of righteousness, they will not adopt it as their way; but if they see the way of error, they will adopt it as their way. That is because they treated Our Signs as lies and were heedless of them","7:147":"And those who reject Our Signs and the meeting of the Hereafter -- their works are vain. Can they expect to be rewarded for anything except for what they do","7:148":"And the people of Moses made, in his absence, out of their ornaments, a calf -- a lifeless body, producing a lowing sound. Did they not see that it spoke not to them, nor guided them to any way? They took it for worship and they were transgressors","7:149":"And when they were smitten with remorse and saw that they had indeed gone astray, they said, 'If our Lord have not mercy on us and forgive us, we shall surely be of the losers","7:150":"And when Moses returned to his people, indignant and grieved, he said, 'Evil is that which you did in my place in my absence. Did you hasten to devise a way for yourselves without waiting for the command of your Lord?' And he put down the tablet and seized his brother by the head, dragging him towards himself. Aaron said, 'Son of my mother, the people indeed deemed me weak, and were about to kill me. Therefore make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune and place me not with the unjust people","7:151":"Moses said, 'My Lord, forgive me and my brother, and admit us to Thy mercy and Thou art the Most Merciful of those who show mercy","7:152":"As to those, who took the calf for worship, wrath from their Lord shall overtake them and abasement in the present life.

They said, 'In order to be absolved from blame before your Lord and that they may turn to righteousness","7:165":"And when they forgot all that with which they had been admonished, We saved those who forbade evil and We seized the transgressors with a severe punishment because they were rebellious","7:166":"And when they insolently rebelled against that which they had been forbidden, We said to them, 'Be ye apes despised","7:167":"And remember the time when thy Lord proclaimed that He would surely rise against them, till the Day of Resurrection, those who would afflict them with grievous torment.

They are pleased to be with those who stay behind, and God hath sealed up their hearts; wherefore they do not understand","9:94":"They will excuse themselves unto you, when ye are returned unto them. Say, excuse not your selves; we will by no means believe you: God hath acquainted us with your behaviour; and God will observe your actions, and his apostle also: And hereafter shall ye be brought before Him who knoweth that which is hidden, and that which is manifest; and He will declare unto you that which ye have done","9:95":"They will swear unto you by God, when ye are returned unto them, that ye may let them alone.

And when the messenger came unto Joseph, he said, return unto thy lord, and ask of him, what was the intent of the women who cut their hands; for my Lord well knoweth the snare which they laid for me","12:51":"And when the women were assembled before the king, he said unto them, what was your design, when ye solicited Joseph to unlawful love? They answered, God be praise! We know not any ill of him. The nobleman's wife said, now is the truth become manifest: I solicited him, to lie with me; and he is one of those who speak truth","12:52":"And when Joseph was acquainted therewith he said, this discovery hath been made, that my lord might know that I was not unfaithful unto him in his absence, and that God directeth not the plot of the deceivers","12:53":"Neither do I absolutely justify my self: Since every soul is prone unto evil, except those on whom my Lord shall shew mercy; for my Lord is gracious and merciful","12:54":"And the king said, bring him unto me: I will take him into my own peculiar service.

But God is the best guardian; and He is the most merciful of those who shew mercy","12:65":"And when they opened their provisions, they found their money had been returned unto them; and they said, O father, what do we desire farther? This our money hath been returned unto us: We will therefore return, and provide corn for our family: We will take care of our brother; and we shall receive a camel's burden more than we did the last time. This is a small quantity","12:66":"Jacob said, I will by no means send him with you, until ye give me a solemn promise, and swear by God that ye will certainly bring him back unto me, unless ye be encompassed by some inevitable impediment. And when they had given him their solemn promise, he said, God is witness of what we say","12:67":"And he said, my sons, enter not into the city by one and the same gate; but enter by different gates. But this precaution will be of no advantage unto you against the decree of God; for judgment belongeth unto God alone: In Him do I put my trust, and in Him let those confide who seek in whom to put their trust","12:68":"And when they entered the city, as their father had commanded them, it was of no advantage unto them against the decree of God; and the same served only to satisfy the desire of Jacob's soul, which he had charged them to perform: For he was indued with knowledge of that which We had taught him; but the greater part of men do not understand","12:69":"And when they entered into the presence of Joseph, he received his brother Benjamin as his guest, and said, verily I am thy brother: Be not therefore afflicted for that which they have committed against us","12:70":"And when he had furnished them with their provisions, he put his cup in his brother Benjamin's sack. Then a cryer cried after them saying, O company of travellers, ye are surely thieves","12:71":"They said, -- and turned back unto them, -- what is it that ye miss","12:72":"They answered, we miss the prince's cup: And unto him who shall produce it, shall be given a camel's load of corn; and I will be surety for the same","12:73":"Joseph's brethren replied, by God, ye do well know, that we come not to act corruptly in the land, neither are we thieves","12:74":"The Egyptians said, what shall be the reward of him, who shall appear to have stolen the cup, if ye be found liars","12:75":"Joseph's brethren answered, as to the reward of him, in whose sack it shall be found, let him become a bondman in satisfaction for the same: Thus do we reward the unjust, who are guilty of theft","12:76":"Then he began by their sacks, before he searched the sack of his brother; and he drew out the cup from his brother's sack. Thus did we furnish Joseph with a stratagem. It was not lawful for him to take his brother for a bondman, by the law of the king of Egypt, had not God pleased to allow it, according to the offer of his brethren. We exalt to degrees of knowledge and honour whom we please: And there is one who is knowing above all those who are indued with knowledge","12:77":"His brethren said, if Benjamin be guilty of theft, his brother Joseph hath been also guilty of theft heretofore. But Joseph concealed these things in his mind, and did not discover them unto them: And he said within himself, ye are in a worse condition than us two; and God best knoweth what ye discourse about","12:78":"They said unto Joseph, noble lord, verily this lad hath an aged father; wherefore take one of us in his stead; for we perceive that thou art a beneficent person","12:79":"Joseph answered, God forbid that we should take any other than him with whom we found our goods; for then should we certainly be unjust","12:80":"And when they despaired of obtaining Benjamin, they retired to confer privately together. And the elder of them said, do ye not know that your father hath received a solemn promise from you, in the name of God; and how perfidiously ye behaved heretofore towards Joseph? Wherefore I will by no means depart the land of Egypt, until my father give me leave to return unto him, or God maketh known his will to me; for he is the best judge","12:81":"Return ye to your father, and say, O father, verily thy son hath committed theft; we bear witness of no more than what we know, and we could not guard against what we did not foresee","12:82":"And do thou inquire in the city, where we have been, and of the company of merchants, with whom we are arrived, and thou wilt find that we speak the truth","12:83":"And when they were returned, and had spoken thus to their father, he said, nay but rather ye your selves have contrived the thing for your own sakes: But patience is most proper for me; peradventure God will restore them all unto me; for he is knowing and wise","12:84":"And he turned from them and said, oh how am I grieved for Joseph! And his eyes became white with mourning, he being oppressed with deep sorrow","12:85":"His sons said, by God, thou wilt not cease to remember Joseph, until thou be brought to death's door, or thou be actually destroyed by excessive affliction","12:86":"He answered, I only represent my grief, which I am not able to contain, and my sorrow unto God; but I know by revelation from God that which ye know not","12:87":"O my sons, go and make inquiry after Joseph and his brother; and despair not of the mercy of God; for none despaireth of God's mercy, except the unbelieving people","12:88":"Wherefore Joseph's brethren returned into Egypt: And when they came into his presence they said, noble lord, the famine is felt by us and our family, and we are come with a small sum of money: Yet give unto us full measure, and bestow corn upon us as alms; for God rewardeth the alms-givers","12:89":"Joseph said unto them, do ye know what ye did unto Joseph and his brother, when ye were ignorant of the consequences thereof","12:90":"They answered, art thou really Joseph? He replied, I am Joseph; and this is my brother. Now hath God been gracious unto us. For whoso feareth God, and persevereth with patience, shall at length find relief; since God will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish","12:91":"They said, by God, now hath God chosen thee above us; and we have surely been sinners","12:92":"Joseph answered, let there be no reproach cast on you this day. God forgiveth you; for he is the most merciful of those who shew mercy","12:93":"Depart ye with this my inner garment, and throw it on my fathers's face; and he shall recover his sight: And then come unto me with all your family","12:94":"And when the company of travellers was departed from Egypt on their journey towards Canaan, their father said unto those who were about him, verily I perceive the smell of Joseph: Although ye think that I dote","12:95":"They answered, by God, thou art in thy old mistake","12:96":"But when the messenger of good tidings was come with Joseph's inner garment, he threw it over his face; and he recovered his eye-sight. And Jacob said, did I not tell you that I knew from God, that which ye knew not","12:97":"They answered, O father, ask pardon of our sins for us, for we have surely been sinners","12:98":"He replied, I will surely ask pardon for you of my Lord; for He is gracious and merciful","12:99":"And when Jacob and his family arrived in Egypt, and were introduced unto Joseph, he received his parents unto him, and said, enter ye into Egypt, by God's favour, in full security","12:100":"And he raised his parents to the seat of state, and they, together with his brethren, fell down and did obeisance unto him. And he said, O my father, this is the interpretation of my vision, which I saw heretofore: Now hath my Lord rendered it true. And He hath surely been gracious unto me, since He took me forth from the prison, and hath brought you hither from the desert; after that the devil had sown discord between me and my brethren: For my Lord is gracious unto whom He pleaseth; and He is the knowing, the wise God","12:101":"O Lord, Thou hast given me a part of the kingdom, and hast taught me the interpretation of dark sayings.

Neither didst thou dwell among the inhabitants of Madian, rehearsing unto them our signs; but We have sent thee fully instructed in every particular","28:46":"Nor wast thou present on the side of the mount, when We called unto Moses: But thou art sent as a mercy from they Lord; that thou mightest preach unto a people to whom no preacher hath come before thee, that peradventure they may be warned","28:47":"and lest, if a calamity had befallen them, for that which their hands had previously committed, they should have said, O Lord, since thou hast not sent an apostle unto us, that we might follow thy signs, and become true believers, are we not excusable","28:48":"Yet when the truth is come unto them from before us, they say, unless he receive the same power to work miracles as Moses received, we will not believe. Have they not likewise rejected the revelation which was heretofore given unto Moses? They say, two cunning impostures have mutually assisted one another: And they say, verily we reject them both","28:49":"Say, produce therefore a book from God, which is more right than these two, that I may follow it; if ye speak truth","28:50":"But if they return thee no answer, know that they only follow their own desires: And who erreth more widely from the truth than he who followeth his own desire, without a direction from God?

And these their dwellings are not inhabited after them, unless for a little while; and We were the inheritors of their wealth","28:59":"But thy Lord did not destroy those cities, until He had sent unto their capital an apostle, to rehearse our signs unto them: Neither did We destroy those cities, unless their inhabitants were injurious to their apostle","28:60":"The things which are given you, are the provisions of this present life, and the pomp thereof; but that which is with God, is better and more durable: Will ye not therefore understand","28:61":"Shall he then, unto whom We have promised an excellent promise of future happiness, and who shall attain the same, be as he on whom we have bestowed the provision of this present life, and who, on the day of resurrection, shall be one of those who are delivered up to eternal punishment","28:62":"On that day God shall call unto them, and shall say, where are my partners, which ye imagined to be so","28:63":"And they upon whom the sentence of damnation shall be justly pronounced, shall answer, these, O Lord, are those whom we seduced; we seduced them as we also had been seduced: But now we clearly quit them, and turn unto Thee. They did not worship Us, but their own lusts","28:64":"And it shall be said unto the idolaters, call now upon those whom ye associated with God: And they shall call upon them, but they shall not answer them; and they shall see the punishment prepared for them, and shall wish that they had submitted to be directed","28:65":"On that day God shall call unto them, and shall say, what answer did ye return to our messengers","28:66":"But they shall not be able to give an account thereof on that day; neither shall they ask one another for information","28:67":"Howbeit whoso shall repent and believe, and shall do that which is right, may expect to be happy","28:68":"Thy Lord createth what He pleaseth; and chooseth freely: But they have no free choice. Praise be unto God; and far be He removed from the idols which they associate with Him","28:69":"Thy Lord knoweth both the secret malice which their breasts conceal, and the open hatred which they discover","28:70":"He is God; there is no God but He.

Did he not know that God had already destroyed, before him, several generations, who were mightier than he in strength, and had amassed more abundance of riches? And the wicked shall not be asked to discover their crimes","28:79":"And Karun went forth unto his people, in his pomp. And they who loved this present life, said, oh that we had the like wealth, as hath been given unto Karun!
