And Allah is All-Sufficient, All-Knower","2:262":"Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, and they don’t follow up what they spent with reminder of generosity or injure them (feeling of the recipients), their reward is with their Lord. There is no fear on them, nor shall they grieve","2:263":"Kind words and forgiving (of faults) are better than charity which is followed by injury. And Allah is Rich (free from all needs), Forbearing","2:264":"O you who believe! Don’t render in vain your charity by reminder of generosity or by injury (feelings of recipients), like those who spend their wealth to be seen by people, and don’t believe in Allah, nor the Last Day. Their example is like a smooth rock with dust over it; and when heavy rain falls on it, leaves it bare. They have no control over anything (reward) which they have earned. Allah does not guide the disbelievers","2:265":"The example of those who spend their wealth seeking the pleasure of Allah while they in their souls are sure that Allah will reward them, is like the example of a garden on a height. When heavy rain falls on it and it yields double its harvest. If heavy rain does not fall on it, then even light rain is sufficient. Allah is All-Seer of what you do","2:266":"Would any of you wish to have a garden of date-palms and grapes with rivers flowing underneath it, and all kinds of fruits are in it for him; while old age has taken over him, and he has weak children (can not look after themselves); then it is struck and burnt down by a fiery whirlwind? Thus Allah makes clear His Verses to you that you may give thought","2:267":"O you who believe! Spend good things which you have (legally) earned, and that which We have produced for you from the earth, and don’t aim at bad (or worthless) things to spend (in charity though) you would not take it for yourself except you overlook (defects) in it.

The wrongdoers shall have no helpers","2:271":"If you disclose your charity, it is well, and if you conceal it and give it to the poor, that is better for you. (Allah) will remove some of your bad deeds. Allah is All-Aware of what you do","2:272":"Not upon you (O Muhammad) is their guidance, but Allah guides whom He wills. Whatever good you spend, it is for yourselves, you don’t spend except seeking the pleasure of Allah. Whatever good you spend, it will be repaid back to you in full, and you will not be wronged","2:273":"Charity is for the poor who are restricted (from travel) for the cause of Allah, they are not able to move about to work in the earth. The ignorant people think them as wealthy because of their modesty. You may know them by their mark; they don’t beg people with repeated demands. Whatever good you spend, surely Allah knows about that well","2:274":"Those who spend their wealth (in Allah’s cause) by night, by day, secretly, and openly, their rewards are with their Lord. There is no fear on them, nor shall they grieve","2:275":"Those who eat interest (usury), they will not stand (before Allah) except like those who are confused (insane) by the touch of Satan. That is because they say: \"Indeed trade is like usury,” while Allah has made the trade lawful and the usury unlawful. So those who receive admonition from their Lord and they refrain, stop eating usury, shall not be punished for the past. Their case is left to Allah (to judge). But those who repeats (to usury), they are inmates of the fire; they will abide in it forever","2:276":"The usury deprives the blessings of Allah and increases by the charity. Allah does not like all ungrateful sinners","2:277":"Indeed those who believe, do righteous deeds, establish prayer, and give obligatory charity; for them their rewards are with their Lord. There is no fear on them, nor shall they grieve","2:278":"O you who believe! Fear Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from usury if you are believers","2:279":"But if you don’t do it, then be warned of war from Allah and His Messenger. If you repent, you may retain your capital sums. You don’t wrong (by asking more than your capital), you will not be wronged (by receiving less than your capital)","2:280":"And if the debtor is in difficulty to pay (has no money), then delay until it is easy to repay.

Then everyone will be paid what he earned and none shall be dealt unjustly","2:282":"O you who believe! When you contract a debt from one another for a fixed period, write it down. Let a scribe write it down between you in justice. A scribe shall not refuse to write it down as Allah has taught, so let the scribe write. Let him (debtor) dictate on whom is the liability fearing Allah, the Lord, and not diminish anything of what he owes. But if the debtor is of poor understanding, or weak, or is not capable to dictate for itself, then let its guardian dictate in justice. Call for 2 witnesses out of your own men. If 2 men are not available, then a man and 2 women, such as you agree as witnesses, so that if one of the 2 women errs, one of them (2 women) reminds other. The witnesses should not refuse when they are called (for evidence). Don’t become weary to write down your contract, small or large for its period. That is more just with Allah, more reliable for evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves, except when it is a present trade which you carry out among yourselves, and then there is no sin on you if you don’t write it down. But take witnesses when you trade with one another. Let neither scribe nor witness suffer any harm, and if you do (such harm), then it is wickedness on your part. So fear Allah and Allah teaches you. Allah is All-Knower of every thing","2:283":"If you are on a journey and you cannot find a scribe, then take a pledge in hand. But if any of you trusts another, then let one who is trusted fulfill its trust (faithfully), and let him fear Allah, his Lord. You don’t conceal the evidence, and whoever conceals it, surely its heart is sinful. Allah is All-Knower of what you do","2:284":"To Allah belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the earth.

Another group was concerned about themselves (on how to save themselves, ignoring the others and the prophet) and thought wrongly of Allah, thought of the (days of) ignorance.

He will say: “Is this not the truth?” They will say: “Yes, our Lord!” He will say: “Then taste the punishment for what you used to disbelieve.”","6:31":"Indeed they will suffer loss who denied meeting with Allah. When the Hour (doomsday) will come to them suddenly, they will say: “Alas for us over what we neglected in it.” They will carry the burden of their sins on their backs.

What is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the Way of Allah, you cling heavily to the earth? Are you pleased with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter? The enjoyment of this life is little compared to the life of the Hereafter","9:39":"If you don’t march forth, He will punish you with a painful punishment and will replace you with other people, and you cannot harm Him at all, and Allah is Able over all things","9:40":"If you don’t help him (Muhammad), (does not matter) indeed Allah did help him when those who disbelieve drove him out (of his town), the 2nd of 2, when they (Muhammad and Abu Bakr) were in the cave (the enemy came close to the opening of the cave), when he (Muhammad) said to his companion (Abu Bakr): “Don’t worry, surely Allah is with us.” Then Allah sent down His Peace upon him, and strengthened him with forces (angels) which you did not see, thus made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest, while the Words of Allah remain uppermost. Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise","9:41":"March forth whether you are light (healthy, young, and wealthy) or heavy (ill, old, and poor), strive hard with your wealth and your lives in the Way of Allah. This is better for you, if you understand","9:42":"(For the hypocrites) if the gain would have been immediate and an easy journey, they would have certainly followed you, but the long journey (Tabuk expedition) was too hard for them. (For not joining you in the expedition) they would swear by Allah: “If only we could, we would certainly have come forth with you.” They destroy their own selves, and Allah knows that they are liars","9:43":"May Allah forgive you (O Muhammad). Why did you grant permission to them (to stay behind), until those who told the truth become clear to you, and you had known the liars","9:44":"Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will not ask your permission (to be exempted) from fighting with their wealth and their lives. And Allah knows all of those who are pious","9:45":"It is only those who don’t believe in Allah and the Last Day and whose hearts are in doubt that ask your permission (exemption from fighting). So in their doubts they waver","9:46":"And if they had intended to march out, certainly they would have made some preparation for it. But Allah did not like their going forth; so He made them lag behind, and it was said (to them): “You sit along with those who sit (at home).”","9:47":"Had they marched out with you, they would have added to you nothing except disorder, and they would have hurried about in your midst (spread corruption) and sowing sedition among you, and there are some among you who would have listened to them. Allah is All-Knower of those who are wrongdoers","9:48":"Surely, they had plotted sedition before, and had upset matters for you, until the truth (victory) came and the Decree of Allah (Islam) became clear though they hated it","9:49":"And among them is he (Jad bin Qais) who said: “Grant me leave (exempt from fighting) and don’t put me into trial (temptation).” Surely, they have already fallen into trial. Surely, hell is surrounding the disbelievers","9:50":"If good befalls you (Muhammad), it grieves them, but if a calamity overtakes you, they say: “Indeed we took our precaution before,” and turn away rejoicing","9:51":"Say: “Nothing will ever happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us. He is our Protector.” And in Allah let the believers put their trust","9:52":"Say: “Do you expect for us anything except one of the 2 best things (martyrdom or victory)? But we are waiting for you either that Allah will afflict you with a punishment from Himself or at our hands. So wait, we too are waiting with you.”","9:53":"Say: “Spend (in Allah’s Cause) willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you. Surely, you are a disobedient people.”","9:54":"Nothing prevents them from being accepted from them their contributions except that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger (Muhammad); and they don’t come to the prayer except they are lazy; and that they offer no contributions but they are unwilling","9:55":"So let not their wealth or their children amaze you (O Muhammad); in reality, Allah intends to punish them with these things in the life of this world, and that their souls may depart (die) while they are disbelievers","9:56":"They swear by Allah that they are truly of you while they are not of you, but they are people (hypocrites) who are afraid of you","9:57":"If they find a refuge, or caves, or a hiding place, they would turn to it straightway with a swift rush","9:58":"Some of them are those who accuse you (O Muhammad) in the matter of the alms (donations). If they are given part from it, they are pleased, but if they are not given from it, behold! They are enraged","9:59":"If they would be contented with what Allah and His Messenger had given them, and had said: “Allah is sufficient for us. Allah will soon give us His Bounty, and so will His Messenger. We implore to Allah (to enrich us).”","9:60":"Only Sadaqah (here it is obligatory charity), alms are for the poor (who beg), the poor (who don’t beg), those employed to collect them (the funds), those whose hearts have been inclined (towards Islam), free the captives, those in debt, those (fighting) in Allah’s Way, and the wayfarer (a traveler who is in need). That is a duty imposed by Allah. Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise","9:61":"And among them are those who hurt the Prophet (Muhammad) by saying: “He is (lending his) ear (to everyone).” Say: “He listens to what is best for you, he believes in Allah, has faith in the believers, and is a mercy to those of you who believe.” But those who hurt Allah’s Messenger (Muhammad) for them there is a painful punishment","9:62":"They swear by Allah to you in order to please you. But Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad) has more right, so they should please Allah if they are believers","9:63":"Do they not know that whoever opposes and shows hostility to Allah and His Messenger, certainly will be in the fire of hell to abide in it? That is extreme disgrace","9:64":"The hypocrites fear lest a chapter (of the Qur’an) should be revealed about them, showing them what is in their hearts. Say: “(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allah will bring to light all that you fear.”","9:65":"If you ask them about this, they declare: “We were only talking idly and joking.” Say: “Was it at Allah and His Verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?”","9:66":"Make no excuse; indeed you have disbelieved after you had believed. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others amongst you because they are criminals","9:67":"The hypocrite men and women are from one another. They enjoin evil (disbelief), forbid from good (Islam), and close their hands (not spending in Allah’s Cause). They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them. Surely, the hypocrites are the disobedient","9:68":"Allah has promised the hypocrite men and women, the disbelievers, the fire of hell, they shall abide in it. It will be sufficient for them. Allah has cursed them and for them is a lasting punishment","9:69":"Like those before you, they were mightier than you in power, and more abundant in wealth and children. They had enjoyed their portion (worldly life), so enjoy your portion (a while) as those before you enjoyed their portion (a while); and you indulge in play and pastime as they indulged in play and pastime. Such are they whose deeds are in vain in this world and in the Hereafter. Such are they who are the losers","9:70":"Has not the story reached them of those before them? The people of Noah, Ad, Thamud; the people of Abraham, the people of Midian and the cities were overthrown (the people of Lot). Their Messengers came to them with clear proofs. So it was not Allah who wronged them, but they used to wrong themselves","9:71":"The believers, men and women, some are protectors of others, they enjoin good, and forbid from evil; and they establish prayers and give the obligatory charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah will have His Mercy on them. Surely Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise","9:72":"Allah has promised the believers, men and women, gardens under which rivers flow to reside in it forever, and beautiful mansions in gardens of Eden (Paradise). The greatest bliss is the good pleasure of Allah. That is the supreme success","9:73":"O Prophet (Muhammad)! Strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm against them, their abode is hell, and worst indeed is the destination","9:74":"They swear by Allah that they did not say (bad), but really they said the word of disbelief, and they disbelieved after accepting Islam. They resolved (plot to murder Prophet Muhammad) which they were unable to carry out. They could not find (any cause to do so) except that Allah and His Messenger had enriched them of His Bounty. If they repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. There is none for them on earth as a protector or a helper","9:75":"And of them are some who made a covenant with Allah (saying): “If He bestowed on us His Bounty, we will surely give charity and will be certainly among those who are righteous.”","9:76":"Then when He gave them His Bounty, they became stingy with it, turned away, and they were reluctant","9:77":"So He punished them by putting hypocrisy into their hearts till the Day when they shall meet Him, because they broke (the covenant with Allah) which they had promised and because they used to tell lies","9:78":"Don’t they know that Allah knows their secret ideas, and their secret talk, and that Allah is the All-Knower of the unseen","9:79":"Those who defame the believers who give charity voluntarily and those who could not find (to give charity) except what is available to them, so they mock at them (believers). Allah will throw back their mockery on them, and they shall have a painful punishment","9:80":"Whether you (O Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites) or not ask forgiveness for them, even if you ask forgiveness for them 70 times, Allah will never forgive them because they have disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad). And Allah does not guide those people who are disobedient","9:81":"Those who stayed behind (from Tabuk expedition), rejoiced in their places behind the Messenger of Allah; and they hated to strive and fight with their wealth and their lives in the Way of Allah. They said: “Don’t march forth in the heat.” Say: “The fire of hell is more intense in heat.” If only they could understand","9:82":"So let them laugh a little and they will cry much as a recompense of what they used to earn (by sins)","9:83":"If Allah brings you back to a party of them (hypocrites), and they ask your permission to go out (to fight), say: “Never you shall go out with me, nor fight an enemy with me; you agreed to sit inactive on the first occasion, then you sit (now) with those who lag behind.”","9:84":"And never (O Muhammad) pray (funeral prayer) for any of them (hypocrites) who dies, nor stand at their graves. Certainly they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and they died while they were disobedient","9:85":"Let not their wealth or their children amaze you. Allah intends to punish them only with these things in this world, and their souls shall depart while they are disbelievers","9:86":"And when a Surah (chapter from the Qur’an) is revealed, (enjoining) that: “They believe in Allah, strive hard, and fight along with His Messenger,” they ask your permission to exempt them (from fighting) those with wealth among them and say: “Leave us (behind), we would be with those who sit (at home).”","9:87":"They are contented to be with those who sit behind (at home). Their hearts are sealed up, so they don’t understand","9:88":"But the Messenger (Muhammad) and those who believed with him, strove hard, and fought with their wealth and their lives. Such are they for whom are the good things, and it is they who will be successful","9:89":"Allah has prepared for them gardens (Paradise) under them rivers flow, to reside in it forever. That is the supreme success","9:90":"And those who made excuses from the Bedouins came (to you, O Prophet) asking your permission to exempt them (from the battle) and stay at home. Those who had lied to Allah and His Messenger, a painful punishment will seize those of them who disbelieved","9:91":"There is no blame on those who are weak or on ill or on those who find no (resources) what they spend (in fighting), if they are sincere (in duty) to Allah and His Messenger. No ground (of complaint) can there be against the righteous people. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","9:92":"Nor (there is blame) on those who when came to you, requested that you provide them with mounts (conveyances), and when you said: “I can find no mounts for you,” they turned back on it, while their eyes were overflowing with tears of grief that they could not find anything to spend (for fighting)","9:93":"The ground (of complaint) is only against those who are rich, and yet asked exemptions. They are content to be with who sit behind (at home) and Allah has sealed up their hearts so that they don’t know (what they are missing)","9:94":"They (the hypocrites) will present excuses to you when you return to them. Say (O Muhammad): “Present no excuses, we shall not believe you. Allah has already informed us of the news concerning you. Allah and His Messenger will observe your deeds. Then you will be brought back to the All-Knower (Allah) of the unseen and the seen, and then He will inform you of what you used to do.”","9:95":"They will swear by Allah to you when you return to them, so that you may turn away from them. So turn away from them. Surely, they are impure, and their living place is hell a recompense for that which they used to earn","9:96":"They (the hypocrites) will swear to you so that you may be pleased with them, but if you are pleased with them, certainly Allah is not pleased with the people who are disobedient","9:97":"The Bedouins are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy, and more likely don’t know the limits which Allah has revealed to His Messenger. Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise","9:98":"Of the Bedouins, there are some who look upon what they spend as a penalty and watch for calamities for you. On them be the calamity of evil. Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower","9:99":"Of the Bedouins there are some who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and look upon what they spend as means of nearness to Allah, (and a cause of receiving) the Messenger’s invocations. Indeed these are means of nearness for them. Allah will admit them to His Mercy. Certainly Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","9:100":"The first and the foremost of the emigrants (migrated from Makkah to Madinah) and the helpers (the citizens of Madinah) and those who followed them in goodness (in faith), Allah is well-pleased with them and they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to reside in it forever. That is the great success","9:101":"From those around you of the Bedouins are hypocrites, and so are some among the people of Madinah, they persist in hypocrisy. You (Muhammad) don’t know them, We know them. We shall punish them twice, and then they will be brought back to a great punishment","9:102":"And (there are) others who have confessed their sins; they have mixed a deed that was righteous with another that was evil. Perhaps that Allah will turn in forgiveness upon them. Surely, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","9:103":"Take alms from their wealth in order to cleanse their wealth and purify them with it, and invoke Allah for them. Surely! Your invocations are a source of security for them, and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower","9:104":"Do they not know that Allah accepts repentance from His servants and takes the charity and that Allah alone is the Accepter of repentance, Merciful","9:105":"Say (O Muhammad): “Do deeds!

And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise","9:107":"And as for those who built a Masjid (Masjid-e-Zirar) by way of harming, disbelief, to disunite between the believers, and as an outpost for those who made war against Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad) before, they will indeed swear that they want nothing but good. Allah bears witness that they are certainly liars","9:108":"You should never stand (to offer prayer) in it. Surely, the Masjid whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety is more deserving that you stand (to pray) in it. In it are people who love to clean and to purify themselves. Allah loves those who make themselves clean and pure","9:109":"Who is a better one; the one who lays the foundation of a building on piety from Allah and His good pleasure, or the one who lays the foundation of a building on a cliff edge ready to crumble down, so that it will crumble to pieces with him into the fire of hell?

And besides Allah you have neither any protector nor any helper","9:117":"Allah forgave the prophet, the emigrants, and the helpers who followed him (Muhammad) in time of distress (Tabuk expedition), after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated (from Right Way), but He accepted repentance from them. Certainly, to them He is Kind, Merciful","9:118":"And (He also forgave) the 3 (did not join the Tabuk expedition) who were left (deferred by the Prophet) till when the earth was straitened to them as it was vast and their own selves were straitened on them.

Surely, the wrongdoers will not be successful.”","12:24":"And indeed she did desire him and he would have inclined to her desire had he not seen the evidence of his Lord.

She said: “What is the punishment for him who intended an evil design against your wife except imprisonment or a painful punishment?”","12:26":"He (Joseph) said: “It was she who sought to seduce me.” A witness of her household bore witness (saying): “If his shirt is torn from the front, then she is speaking the true and he is lying","12:27":"But if his shirt is torn from the back, then she is lying and he is speaking the truth.”","12:28":"So when he (her husband) saw his (Joseph’s) shirt torn from the back; he said (to her): “Surely, it is your plot (O women).

(When they were ready to cut) she asked (Joseph): “Come out before them.” When they saw him, they exalted him (at his beauty) and (to their surprise) cut their hands. They exclaimed: “Allah forbid! This is not a man! This is none but a noble angel!”","12:32":"She said: “This is he (young man) about whom you did blame me. Indeed I sought to seduce him, but he refused. Now if he does not do what I order him, he will certainly be cast into prison, and will be one of those who are disgraced.”","12:33":"He (Joseph) said: \"O my Lord!

(The interpretation of dream is) one of you will (be released and) serve wine to his master (the king of Egypt); and the other will be crucified, and birds will eat from his head. That is how the cases will be judged concerning which you both inquired.”","12:42":"And he said to the one of them whom he knew to be saved (released): “Mention me to your master (king).” But Satan made him forget to mention it to his master.

Surely, my Lord is well aware of their plot.”","12:51":"He (king) said (to the women): “What do you say about the affair when you did seek to seduce Joseph?” The women said: “Allah forbid! We don’t know evil against him!” The wife of Al-Aziz said: “Now the truth is clear, it was I who sought to seduce him. He is surely of the truthful.”","12:52":"(Joseph) said: “(I asked for this enquiry) in order that he (Al-Aziz) may know that I did not betray him in secret.

Measure of grain has been denied for us (unless we take our brother Benjamin). Send our brother with us so that we may get our measure and truly we are guardians for him.”","12:64":"He said: “Can I entrust him to you except as I entrusted on his brother (Joseph) to you before? But Allah is the best to guard and He is Merciful of those who show mercy.”","12:65":"And when they opened their bags, they found their money had been returned to them. They said: “O our father! What more can we desire? Here is our money returned to us. We will get food for our family; we will guard our brother, and add more measure of camel’s load (of grain). This quantity is easy (for the king to give).”","12:66":"He (Jacob) replied: \"I will not send him with you until you give a solemn oath to me in the name of Allah that you will bring him back to me unless you are yourselves surrounded (by enemies).” When they gave him their solemn oath, he said: “Allah is trustee over what we have said.”","12:67":"And he said: “O my sons! Don’t enter by one gate, but enter by different gates. I cannot avail you anything against Allah. Surely! The decision rests only with Allah. In Him, I put my trust. In Him let all those that trust, put their trust.”","12:68":"When they entered (the city) from where their father had ordered them, it did not avail them in the least against (the will of) Allah, but it was a need of Jacob’s inner-self which he discharged. Surely, he was endowed with knowledge because We had taught him, but most people don’t know","12:69":"When they went before Joseph, he called his brother (Benjamin) to himself and said: “Surely! I am your brother, so don’t grieve for what they used to do.”","12:70":"So when he (Joseph) had furnished them with their provisions, he put the (golden) bowl into his brother’s bag, then a crier cried: “O you in the caravan! Surely, you are thieves!”","12:71":"They said turning towards them: “What is it that you have lost?”","12:72":"They said: “We have lost the (golden) bowl of the king and for him who produces it (is the reward of) a load of camel; and I will be bound by it.”","12:73":"They said: “By Allah! Indeed you know that we came not to make mischief in the land, and we are not thieves!”","12:74":"They (Joseph’s people) said: “What then should be the penalty of him, if you are liars?”","12:75":"They (Joseph’s brothers) replied: “His penalty should be he, in whose bag it is found, and then it is his punishment. Thus we punish the wrongdoers!”","12:76":"So he (Joseph) began to search their bags before the bag of his brother (Benjamin). Then he brought it out of his brother’s bag. Thus We did plan for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the law of the king, except that Allah willed it. We raise to degrees whom We will, but over all those endowed with knowledge is the All-knower (Allah)","12:77":"They (Joseph’s brothers) said: “If he steals, surely, a brother of his (Joseph) did steal before him.” But these things Joseph did keep in himself, not revealing (the secrets) to them. He said: “You are in worst case. Allah is the Best Knower of the truth what you assert!”","12:78":"They said: “O mighty one! Surely, he (Benjamin) has a very old father (who will grieve for him); so take one of us in his place. Indeed we think you are one of the righteous people.”","12:79":"He (Joseph) replied: “Allah forbids that we should take anyone but him with whom we found our property. Indeed we then should be wrongdoers.”","12:80":"When they despaired of him, they held a conference in private. The eldest among them said: “Don’t you know that your father indeed took an oath from you in Allah’s name, and before this you did fail in your duty with Joseph?

Surely, your son (Benjamin) has stolen. We don’t testify except according to what we know, and we could not be guardians of the unseen","12:82":"Ask (the people of) the town where we have been in it, and the caravan in which we returned, and indeed we are telling the truth.”","12:83":"He (Jacob) said: “Nay, you have lured your own souls into something (story). So patience is most fitting for me. May be Allah will bring them all to me. Truly He! He is the All-Knower, All- Wise.”","12:84":"He turned away from them and said: “Alas for Joseph!” His sight was whitened (lost) because of the sorrow that he was suppressing","12:85":"They said: “By Allah! You will never cease remembering Joseph until you become weak with old age, or until you are of the dead.”","12:86":"He said: “I only complain of my grief and sorrow to Allah, and I know from Allah what you don’t know","12:87":"O my sons! You go and enquire about Joseph and his brother, and never give up hope of Allah’s Mercy. Certainly no one despairs of Allah’s Mercy, except the disbelievers.”","12:88":"When they entered unto him (Joseph), they said: “O ruler of the land! A hard time has hit us and our family, and we have brought little money, so pay us full measure and be charitable to us. Truly, Allah rewards the charitable.”","12:89":"He (Joseph) said: “Do you know what you did with Joseph and his brother, when you were ignorant?”","12:90":"They said: “Are you indeed Joseph?” He said: \"I am Joseph, and this is my brother (Benjamin). Allah has indeed been gracious to us. Surely, he who fears Allah and is patient, then surely, Allah does not make the reward of the righteous people to be lost.”","12:91":"They said: ‘By Allah! Indeed Allah has preferred you above us, and certainly we have been sinners.”","12:92":"He (Joseph) said: “There is no blame on you this Day. May Allah forgive you. He is the Merciful of those who show mercy","12:93":"You go with this shirt of mine, cast it over the face of my father, he will become clear-sighted, and bring to me all your family.”","12:94":"When the caravan departed, their father said: “I do indeed feel the smell of Joseph, even if you think me weak of mind due to old age.”","12:95":"They said: “By Allah! Certainly, you are in your old error.”","12:96":"Then when the bearer of the glad tidings arrived, he cast it (the shirt) over his face, and he became clear-sighted. He (father) said: “Did I not say to you, surely I know from Allah what you don’t know?”","12:97":"They said: “O our father! Ask forgiveness (from Allah) for our sins, indeed we have been sinners.”","12:98":"He replied: “I will ask my Lord for forgiveness for you. Surely He! Only He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.”","12:99":"When they entered unto Joseph, he took his parents to himself and said: “Enter Egypt, if Allah wills, in security.”","12:100":"And he raised his parents to the throne, and they fell down before him prostrate.

A disaster will not cease to strike those who disbelieve because what (evil) they did or it (disaster) settles close to their homes, until the Promise of Allah comes. Certainly, Allah does not break His Promise","13:32":"And indeed many Messengers were mocked before you (O Muhammad), but I granted respite to those who disbelieved, then I seized them.

He calls you (to Allah) so that He may forgive you of your sins and give you respite for a term appointed.” They said: “You are not but a human being like us! You wish to turn us away from what our forefathers used to worship.

Surely, the recitation of the Qur’an in the early dawn is witnessed (by angels)","17:79":"And in (some parts of) the night perform the night prayer with it (recite the Qur’an) as an additional prayer (Tahajjud) for you (O Muhammad). It may be that your Lord will raise you to ‘Maqam-e-Mahmood’ (a station of praise-worthy on the Day of Resurrection)","17:80":"And say (O Muhammad): “My Lord! Make me enter (the city of Madinah) one entry in truth, and bring me out (from the city of Makkah) one exit in truth. And grant me from You an authority helper,”","17:81":"and say: “Truth has come and the falsehood has vanished. Surely! Falsehood is bound to vanish.”","17:82":"And We have sent down the Qur’an which is a healing and a Mercy to the believers, while it increases nothing but loss to the wrongdoers","17:83":"And when We bestow Our Grace on mankind, it turns away and becomes far away at one side (from the Right Way). When evil touches, it is in great despair","17:84":"Say (O Muhammad to mankind): “Everyone acts according to its manner; but your Lord knows best whose way (religion) is best guided.”","17:85":"And they ask you (O Muhammad) about the soul (spirit). Say: “The soul is one of the commands of my Lord and you have not been given the knowledge of it but a little.”","17:86":"And if We willed, We could surely take away all that which We have revealed to you (this Qur’an). Then you would find no protector for you against Us (to get it back)","17:87":"except as a Mercy from your Lord. Surely! His Grace to you (O Muhammad) is great indeed","17:88":"Say: “If the mankind and the jinns together were to bring the like of this Qur’an, they could not bring the like thereof, even if some of them was helper to some others.”","17:89":"And indeed We have fully explained to mankind in this Qur’an every kind of similitude, but most people refuse but disbelief","17:90":"And they say: “We shall not believe in you (O Muhammad) until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us","17:91":"or there is a garden of date-palms and grapes for you and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst abundantly","17:92":"or you cause to fall the heaven upon us in pieces as you have claimed, or you bring Allah and the angels (face to face) before us","17:93":"or there is a house of adorable materials (like silver and gold) for you, or you ascend up into the sky, and we shall not believe in your ascension until you bring down for us a book that we would read.” Say (O Muhammad): “Glory be to my Lord! Am I (claimed) anything more but a human, sent as a Messenger?”","17:94":"And nothing prevented people from belief when the guidance came to them except that they said: “Has Allah sent a human as (His) Messenger?”","17:95":"Say: “If there were angels walking on the earth in peace, then We would certainly have sent down to them an angel from the heaven as a Messenger.”","17:96":"Say: “Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and between you. Surely! He is All-Knower, the All-Seer of His servants.”","17:97":"And those whom Allah guides are rightly guided; but those whom He sends astray, they will never find protectors for them besides Him. We shall gather them on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf. Their abode will be hell; whenever its flame abates, We shall increase the fierceness of fire for them","17:98":"That is their recompense because they denied Our Verses and they said: “When we are reduced to bones and fragments, shall we really be resurrected as new creation?”","17:99":"They don’t see that Allah, who has created the heavens and the earth, is able to create the people like them. He has made for them an appointed term; there is no doubt in it. But the wrongdoers refuse but disbelief","17:100":"Say (to the disbelievers): “Even if you possessed all the treasures of the Mercy of my Lord, you would surely hold them back for fear of spending. Human is ever miserly!”","17:101":"And indeed We gave to Moses 9 clear signs. Ask the children of Israel, when he came to them, then Pharaoh said to him: “O Moses! I think you are indeed bewitched.”","17:102":"(Moses) replied: “Surely, you know that no one has sent down these signs but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as clear signs. Surely O Pharaoh, I think you are doomed to destruction.”","17:103":"So he (Pharaoh) wanted to turn them out of the land (of Egypt). But We drowned him and all who were with him","17:104":"And We said to the children of Israel after him: “You reside in the land and then when the last promise comes, We shall assemble you as a mixed crowd.”","17:105":"And We have sent it (the Qur’an) down with truth and with truth it has descended. And We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except as a bearer of glad-tidings and a Warner","17:106":"And We have divided the Qur’an (into parts) so that you may recite it to people at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages (in 23 years)","17:107":"Say (O Muhammad to them): “Whether you believe in it (the Qur’an) or don’t believe, surely those who were given knowledge before it (Jews and Christians like Abdullah bin Salam and Salman Al-Farsi), they fall down on their faces in prostration when it is recited to them","17:108":"and they say: ‘Glory be to our Lord! Surely, the Promise of our Lord must be fulfilled.’","17:109":"And they fall down on their faces, weeping and it increases their humility.”","17:110":"Say (O Muhammad): “Invoke Allah or invoke the Beneficent, by whatever name you invoke Him, to Him belongs the best names. Offer your prayer neither aloud nor make it in a low voice but seek a way between these","17:111":"and say: “Praise be to Allah, Who has not taken a son, and Who has no partner in (His) Dominion, nor there is any protector for Him out of dependence. And magnify Him with all magnificence.”","18:1":"All the praises be to Allah Who has sent down to His servant (Muhammad) the book (the Qur’an) and has not placed therein any crookedness","18:2":"(He has made it) right to give warning (to the disbelievers) of a severe punishment from Him, and to give glad tidings to the believers who work righteous deeds so that they shall have a good reward (Paradise)","18:3":"(they shall) abide in it forever","18:4":"Also to warn those who say: “Allah has begotten a son.”","18:5":"They don’t have knowledge about it, nor did their forefathers. Mighty is the word that comes out of their mouths. They say nothing but a lie","18:6":"Perhaps, you would kill yourself (O Muhammad) in grief over their footsteps, because they don’t believe in this narration (the Qur’an)","18:7":"Surely! We have made the earth with all kinds of adornments in order that We may test them (mankind) and to see which of them are best in deeds","18:8":"And surely We shall reduce what is on it (the earth) to a bare dry soil","18:9":"Do you think that the people of the cave and the inscription (news or name writing of the people of the cave) were a wonder among Our Signs","18:10":"(Remember) when the young men fled (for refuge from their disbelieving folk) to the cave, they said: “Our Lord! Bestow on us Mercy from You and facilitate for us in our affair to the Right Way!”","18:11":"Therefore We covered on their ears (causing them into deep sleep) in the cave for a number of years","18:12":"then We raised them up (from sleep) so that We might test which of the 2 parties (believers and disbelievers) was best at calculating the time period for which they had stayed","18:13":"We narrate to you (O Muhammad) their story with truth. Surely they were young men who believed in their Lord and We increased them in guidance","18:14":"And We made their hearts firm and strong when they stood up and said: “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, we shall never call upon any deity other than Him; for if we do, then we shall utter something improper (in disbelief)","18:15":"These are our people who have taken for deities other than Him (Allah). Why do they not bring for them a clear authority? And who does more wrong than the one who invents a lie against Allah?”","18:16":"(They consulted with one another and said): “Now we have withdrawn from them and denounced those deities whom they worship except Allah, then seek refuge in the cave; our Lord will open a way for us from His Mercy and will make easy for us in our affair.”","18:17":"And you might have seen the sun when it rose, it declines to the right from their cave; and when it set, it turns away from them towards the left while they lay in the middle of the cave. That is one of the signs of Allah. Whoever He guides is rightly guided; but whoever He sends astray, you will never find guiding friend (to lead to the Right Way) for him","18:18":"And you would have thought them awake, though they were asleep. And We turned them to the right and to the left sides, while their dog stretched out its 2 forelegs at the entrance (of the cave). Had you looked at them, you would have certainly turned back from them in flight and (their sight) certainly would have filled with awe of them","18:19":"Thus, We awakened them (from long deep sleep) so that they could question among them. A speaker from them said: “How long have you stayed here?” They said: “Perhaps we have stayed here for a day or part of a day.” They said: “Our Lord knows best how long we have stayed here. So send one of us with our silver coin to the city, and let him find out which is the purest food, and let him bring us some of it. Let him be careful and don’t let anyone know our whereabouts","18:20":"Surely if they learn about you, they will stone you (to death), or turn you back into their religion, and in that case you will never ever be successful.”","18:21":"And thus We made their case known so that people might know that the Promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour (of Judgment). (Remember) when they (the people of the city) disputed among themselves about their case, they said: “Construct a building over them, their Lord knows best about them.” Those who won on their point said: “Surely we shall build a place of worship over them.”","18:22":"Some say they were 3 and their dog was the 4th of them. Others say they were 5 and their dog was the 6th of them guessing at the unseen. Yet, others say they were 7 and their dog was the 8th of them. Say (O Muhammad): “My Lord knows best their number. None knows them but a few.” So don’t debate about them except with clear proof and don’t consult about them (people of Cave) with anyone","18:23":"And never say of anything: “Surely I shall do that tomorrow,”","18:24":"except that (say): “If Allah wills!” And remember your Lord when you forget and say: “I hope that my Lord will guide me to a closer way of guidance than this.”","18:25":"And (some say) they stayed in their cave 300 years (solar) and add 9 (lunar years)","18:26":"(O Muhammad) say: “Allah knows best how long they stayed. With Him is (the knowledge of) the unseen of the heavens and the earth. How clearly He sees with it and how clearly He hears! They did not have any helper other than Him, and He does not share in His Decision and rule with anyone.”","18:27":"And recite what has been revealed to you (O Muhammad) from the book (the Qur’an) of your Lord. None can change His Words and you will never find a refuge other than Him","18:28":"Keep yourself (O Muhammad) patiently with those who call their Lord in the morning and the evening seeking His pleasure, and don’t let your eyes overlook them desiring the beauty of the life of the world; don’t obey the one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who follows own lusts and whose affair has been lost","18:29":"(O Muhammad) say: “The truth is from your Lord. Whoever wills let him believe, and whoever wills, let him disbelieve.” Surely, We have prepared a fire for the wrongdoers; its walls will surround them (disbelievers). If they ask for help, they will be granted water like boiling oil that will burn faces. Terrible is the drink and evil is the resting place","18:30":"Surely! Those who believe and do righteous deeds, We shall not lose the reward of him who does good deeds","18:31":"Those are the ones for them there will be gardens of Eden; rivers flow beneath them; they will be decorated therein with bracelets of gold, and they will wear green garments of fine and thick silk. They will recline therein on raised thrones. How good is the reward, and how excellent is the resting place","18:32":"And (O Muhammad) put forward to them the example of 2 men: We had given 2 gardens of grapes to one of them, We had surrounded them with date-palms, and had made cultivated fields between them","18:33":"Both the gardens brought forth their produce and did not fail in the least. We (even) caused a river to gush forth in the middle of them","18:34":"And there was abundant produce for him and he said to his companion while he was talking to him: “I have more wealth than you and stronger (in respect of) men.”","18:35":"And he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself. He said: “I don’t think that this garden will ever perish","18:36":"And I don’t think the Hour will ever come. Even if I am brought back to my Lord, surely I shall find better than this at the end.”","18:37":"His companion said to him while he was talking to him: “Do you disbelieve in Him Who created you out of dust, then out of semen, then fashioned you into a man","18:38":"He is my Lord and I shall not associate anyone with my Lord","18:39":"When you entered your garden, why did you not say: ‘It is as Allah wills! There is no power but with Allah!’ If you see me, I have less wealth than you and children","18:40":"it may be that my Lord will give me something better than your garden, and may send a punishment from the sky on it, then turn it into a slippery earth","18:41":"Or its water will become deep-sunken (dry underground) so that you will never be able to find it.”","18:42":"(It so happened that) his fruits were surrounded (with ruin). He began twisting his hands (with sorrow) over what he had spent on it while all (fruits) were destroyed on their nets, and he said: “I wish I had not associated anyone with my Lord!”","18:43":"And he could neither find anyone to help him other than Allah, nor could he defend himself","18:44":"The real power (protection) comes from Allah, the true one worthy of worship. He (Allah) is the best for reward and the best for the final end","18:45":"And (O Muhammad) put forward for them the example of the worldly life. It is like water (rain) which We send down from the sky and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it. (But later it) becomes dry stalks which the winds scatter. And Allah has power over everything","18:46":"Wealth and children are the adornment of the worldly life. But the lasting righteous deeds are better with your Lord for rewards and better hope","18:47":"And (remember) the Day when We shall cause the mountains to move, you will see the earth as a leveled plain (of waste), We shall gather them, and will not leave anyone of them behind","18:48":"And they will be set before your Lord in rows (and Allah will say): “Now indeed you have come to Us as We created you the first time. Nay, but you thought that We had never appointed a meeting for you.”","18:49":"And the book (one’s record) will be placed (before them), and you will see the sinners fearful of what is (recorded) in it. They will say: “Woe to us! What is the matter with this book? Neither it leaves out a small thing nor a big thing but has recorded it with numbers!” They will find all that they did and placed before them. Your Lord will not treat anyone with injustice","18:50":"And (remember) when We said to the angels: “Prostrate to Adam,” all prostrated except Satan. He was one of the jinns; he disobeyed the command of its Lord. Will you then take him (Satan) and its progeny as your protectors rather than Me while they are enemies to you? What an evil is the exchange for the wrongdoers","18:51":"(Allah) did not make them (Satan and its offspring) to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation, nor I (Allah) took the misleaders (of mankind) as helpers","18:52":"And (remember) the Day when He will say: “Call those partners of Mine whom you claimed.” They will cry to them but they will not answer them and We shall put a barrier between them","18:53":"And the sinners will see the fire and realize that they have to fall therein. And they will not find a way of escape from it","18:54":"And indeed We explained every example in this Qur’an for mankind (to understand). But human is quarrelsome of most things","18:55":"And nothing prevents mankind from believing and asking forgiveness of their Lord when the guidance (the Qur’an) has come to them, except that the way of the ancients come upon them or the punishment come upon them face to face","18:56":"We sent the Messengers except as bearers of glad tidings and warners. But the disbelievers disputed with false argument in order to refute the truth. They took My Verses with which they were warned, as a joke","18:57":"And who is more unjust than the one who, when reminded of the Verses of the Lord, turns away from them and forgets what deeds its own hands have done? (For these people) surely, We have set veils over their hearts so they don’t understand it (the Qur’an), and their ears are (covered) with deafness. If you (O Muhammad) call them to the guidance, even then they will never be guided","18:58":"And your Lord is Forgiving, the Owner of Mercy. If He calls them to account for what they have earned, He would have hastened the punishment for them. But they have their appointed time, beyond which they will never find an escape","18:59":"And We destroyed these towns with them (Ad, Thamud inhabitants) when they did wrong. We appointed a fixed time for their destruction","18:60":"And (remember) when Moses said to his young servant: “I will not give up (traveling) until I reach the junction of the 2 seas or (until) I spend years (in traveling).”","18:61":"But when they reached the junction between them, they forgot (about) their fish (they were carrying), which made its way through the sea as in a tunnel","18:62":"So when they had passed further on, he (Moses) said to his young servant: “Bring us our breakfast; truly we have suffered this fatigue in our journey.”","18:63":"He replied: “Do you remember when we were resting ourselves beside the rock? Indeed I forgot the fish, none but Satan made me forget to remember it. It took its way into the sea in a strange way!”","18:64":"(Moses) said: “That is what we have been seeking.” So they went back retracing their footsteps","18:65":"Then they found one of Our servant (Khidr) whom We had bestowed Mercy from Us, and We had taught him knowledge from Us","18:66":"Moses requested him: “May I follow you so that you may teach me something of that knowledge which you have been taught (by Allah)?”","18:67":"He (Khidr) said: “Surely! You will never be able to have patience with me","18:68":"how can you have patience about that which is beyond your knowledge?”","18:69":"(Moses) said: “You will find me patient if Allah wills, and I will not disobey your command.”","18:70":"He (Khidr) said: “Then, if you follow me, don’t ask me about anything until I myself mention it to you.”","18:71":"So they both proceeded, till when they embarked in a ship, Khidr made a hole in it. Moses said: “Have you made a hole in it to drown its people? Surely, you have done a bad thing.”","18:72":"He (Khidr) said: “Did I not tell you that you would never be able to have patience with me?”","18:73":"(Moses) said: “Don’t call me to account for what I forgot, and don’t be hard on me for my affair (with you).”","18:74":"Then they both proceeded till they met a boy, then Khidr killed him. Moses said: “Have you killed an innocent person who killed none? Surely, you have committed an evil thing!”","18:75":"(Khidr) said: “Did I not tell you that you would never be able to have patience with me?”","18:76":"(Moses) said: “If I ever ask you about anything after this, don’t keep me in your company, (If I ask again then) surely you will have an excuse in my case.”","18:77":"Then they both proceeded, till they came to the people of a town. They asked its people for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found in it a wall that was about to collapse, so Khidr set it up straight. Moses said: “If you had wished, surely you could have taken some wages for it!”","18:78":"(Khidr) said: “This is the parting (time) between me and you. (First) I will tell you the interpretation of those (acts) over which you could not have patience","18:79":"As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working in the sea. I intended to damage it as there was a king after them who was seizing every ship by force","18:80":"As for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared lest he would oppress them by rebellion and disbelief","18:81":"So we intended that their Lord should exchange for them one (son) better than him in righteousness and near to mercy","18:82":"As for the wall, it belonged to 2 orphan boys in the town and there was a treasure for them under it. Since their father was a righteous man, your Lord intended that they should attain their age of full strength and then take out their treasure as a Mercy from your Lord. I did not do them by my own will. That is the interpretation of (those actions) over which you could not hold patience.”","18:83":"And (O Muhammad) they ask you about Dhul-Qarnain. Say: “I shall recite to you something of him.”","18:84":"Surely, We established him in the earth and gave him means of everything","18:85":"So he followed a way (towards the west)","18:86":"until, when he reached the setting place of the sun, he found it setting in a spring of black muddy water. He found a people near it. We said: “O Dhul-Qarnain! Either you punish them, or treat them with kindness.”","18:87":"He said (to people): “Whoever will do wrong, we shall punish him; then he will be brought back to the Lord, who will punish with a terrible punishment","18:88":"As for him who believes and does righteous deeds, he shall have the best reward (Paradise), and we (Dhul-Qarnain) shall speak to him with mild words.”","18:89":"Then he followed another way (towards the east)","18:90":"until, when he reached the rising place of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had not provided any shelter against it (the sun)","18:91":"(He left them) as it was! And We knew whatever information was with him (Dhul-Qarnain)","18:92":"Then he followed (another) way","18:93":"until, when he reached between 2 mountains where he found (near) them a people who almost did not understood a word","18:94":"They said: “O Dhul-Qarnain! Surely! (The people of) Gog and Magog are doing mischief in the land. Shall we pay to you a tribute in order that you make a barrier between us and them?”","18:95":"He said: “What my Lord has granted me is better (than your tribute). Just help me with strength (manpower) and I will erect a barrier between you and them","18:96":"Give me pieces (blocks) of iron.” Until when he leveled the gap between the 2 mountain-cliffs, he said: “Blow,” until when he had made it (red iron) fire, he said: “Bring me molten copper to pour over it.”","18:97":"So they (Gog and Magog) could not scale it nor could they dig through","18:98":"(Dhul-Qarnain) said: “This is a Mercy from my Lord. But when the Promise of my Lord will come, He shall make it flat (leveled).

The trumpet will be blown and We shall collect them (the creatures) all together","18:100":"On that Day We shall present hell to the disbelievers with plain view","18:101":"(to) those whose eyes had been under a covering from My Reminder (this Qur’an), and who could not bear to hear it","18:102":"Do the disbelievers then think that they can take My Servants as protectors besides Me? Surely, We have prepared hell as an entertainment for the disbelievers","18:103":"Say (O Muhammad): “Should We inform you of the greatest losers in respect of deeds","18:104":"Those whose efforts have been wasted in the worldly life while they thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds","18:105":"they are those who disbelieve in the Verses of their Lord and the meeting with Him (Hereafter). So their deeds will be in vain, We shall not assign any weight (reward) on the Day of Resurrection for them","18:106":"Thus their recompense will be hell; because they disbelieved, took My Verses and My Messengers as a joke","18:107":"Surely! Those who believe and do righteous deeds, they will be entertained with the gardens of Paradise","18:108":"They will reside in it forever. They will never desire for removal from there.”","18:109":"Say (O Muhammad to mankind): “If the sea were ink for (writing) the Words of my Lord, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord would be exhausted, even if We brought (another sea) like it for its aid.”","18:110":"Say (O Muhammad): “I am but a human like you.

I will show you My Signs, so don’t ask Me to hasten","21:38":"And they ask: “When will this promise (be fulfilled) if you are truthful?”","21:39":"(They would not ask) if the disbelievers knew the time when they will neither be able to protect their faces from the fire nor their backs, and they will not be helped","21:40":"Nay, it (the fire) will come to them all of a sudden and will perplex them, so they will neither be able to avert it nor they will get any respite","21:41":"Indeed Messengers were mocked before you (O Muhammad), but those who mocked were surrounded by what they used to mock at","21:42":"Say: “Who can protect you in the night and the day from the (punishment of) the Gracious?” Nay, but they turn away from the remembrance of their Lord","21:43":"Or do they have (ones worthy of worship) who can guard them from Us? They have neither any power to help themselves, nor can they be protected from Us (punishment)","21:44":"Nay, We gave luxuries (of this life to) these people and their forefathers until the life grew long for them. Don’t they then see how We (gradually) reduce the land (their control) from its all sides? Is it then they who will overcome (be victorious)","21:45":"Say (O Muhammad): “I warn you only by the revelation (from Allah).” But the deaf will not hear the call when they are warned","21:46":"And if a breath (minor calamity) of punishment of your Lord touches them, surely they will cry: “Woe to us!

If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then remember, We have created you from dust, then from a mixed drops of male and female sexual discharge (sperm), then from a clot (thick coagulated blood), then from a little lump of human flesh formed and unformed (miscarriage), so that We may make it clear to you. And We cause it to remain in the wombs whom We will for an appointed term, then We bring you out as infants, then you may reach your age of full strength.

I have come to you from Sheba with true news","27:23":"Surely I found a woman ruling over them, and she has been given from every thing, and she has a great throne","27:24":"I found her and her people prostrating themselves before the sun instead of Allah, Satan has made their deeds seem fair to them, and has barred them from (Allah’s) Way, so they are not guided","27:25":"they don’t prostrate themselves before Allah, Who brings out the hidden thing in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal","27:26":"Allah, there is no one worthy of worship but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!”","27:27":"(Solomon) said: “We shall see whether you speak the truth or you are of the liars","27:28":"Go with this letter of mine, and deliver it to them, then bring back from them, and see what answer they return.”","27:29":"She (the queen) said: “O chiefs! Surely! A noble letter has been delivered to me","27:30":"surely it is from Solomon, and surely it reads: In the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful","27:31":"(It reads) Don’t be exalted against me, but come to me as Muslims.”","27:32":"She said: \"O chiefs! Advise me in my case. I don’t decide any case till you are present.”","27:33":"They said: “We have power and great strength, and the matter is for you to command; so think what you will command.”","27:34":"She said: “Surely! When the kings enter a town, they spoil it, and make the most honorable of its people the lowest. And thus they always do","27:35":"But surely I will send them a present, and see with what answer the Messengers return.”","27:36":"So when (the envoys of the Queen with the present) came to Solomon, he said: “Will you help me in wealth? What Allah has given me is better than that which He has given you! Nay, you rejoice in your gift","27:37":"(Solomon said to the chief of her messengers who brought the present): Go back to them (your people). (If your people don’t submit) surely we shall come to them with army which they will never be able to resist, we shall drive them out from there (land) in disgrace, and they will be humiliated.”","27:38":"(When Solomon heard that the Queen of Sheba was coming in submission) he said: “O chiefs! Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me as Muslims?”","27:39":"A strong one from the jinns said: “I will bring it to you before you rise from your place (council). Surely, I am indeed strong, trustworthy for such work.”","27:40":"One with whom was the knowledge of the Scripture said: “I will bring it to you before your eyesight returns to you (within twinkling of an eye)!” Then when he (Solomon) saw it placed before him, he said: “This is from the Grace of my Lord to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! Whoever is grateful, indeed is grateful for oneself, and whoever is ungrateful (should know that) certainly, my Lord is Rich, Bountiful.”","27:41":"Then he said: “Disguise for her throne so that we may see whether she will be guided (able to recognize her throne), or she will be of those who are not guided.”","27:42":"So when she came, it was said (to her): “Is your throne like this?” She said: “(It is) as though it were the same. Knowledge was bestowed on us in advance of this, and we have become Muslims (submitted to Allah).”","27:43":"Other deities which she used to worship besides Allah has prevented her (from Islam), indeed she was of a disbelieving people","27:44":"It was said to her: “Enter the palace.” (The floor was glass surface with water underneath it). But when she saw it, she thought it was a pool, and she (pulled up her clothes) uncovering her legs. Solomon said: “Surely, it is a palace (with a glass surface and water underneath it) traced smooth with glass.” She said: “My Lord! Surely, I have wronged myself, and I submit (accept Islam) with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.”","27:45":"And indeed We sent to Thamud their brother Saleh, saying: “Worship Allah.” Then look! They became 2 parties (believers and disbelievers) quarreling with each other","27:46":"He said: “O my people! Why do you seek to hasten the evil (Allah’s punishment) before the good (Allah’s Mercy)? Why don’t you seek the forgiveness of Allah, so that you may be treated with mercy?”","27:47":"They said: “We consider bad luck from you and those with you.” He said: “Your luck is with Allah; in fact, you are a people that are being tested.”","27:48":"There were in the city 9 men (leaders) who made mischief in the land, and they would not reform","27:49":"They said: “Swear one to another by Allah so that we shall surely make a night attack on him and his family, and afterwards we will surely say to his near relatives: we did not witness the destruction of his family, and surely! We are truthful.”","27:50":"So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they did not perceive","27:51":"Thus see how the end of their plot was! Surely! We destroyed them and their nation, all together","27:52":"These are their houses in ruin, for what they did wrong. Surely, in this is indeed a sign for people who know","27:53":"And We saved those who believed, and used to fear Allah","27:54":"And (remember) Lot! When he said to his people: “Do you commit indecency while you see","27:55":"Why do you come to men with lust instead of women? Nay, but you are a people who are ignorant.”","27:56":"There was no answer by his people except that they said: “Drive out the family of Lot from your city. Surely, they are a people who are clean!”","27:57":"So We saved him and his family, except his wife. We destined her to be of those who remained behind","27:58":"And We rained down on them a rain (of stones). So evil was the rain of those who were warned","27:59":"Say (O Muhammad): “All praise is to Allah, and peace be on His servants whom He has chosen! Is Allah better, or that you ascribe as partners (to Him)?”","27:60":"Is not He (better than false deities) Who has created the heavens and the earth, and sends down from the sky water (rain) for you and We cause to grow gardens with it full of beauty and delight?

Surely! We shall bring him back to you and will make him one of the Messengers.”","28:8":"Then the family of Pharaoh picked him up (from river), that he might become an enemy for them and (a cause of) grief. Surely! Pharaoh, Haman and their hosts were sinners","28:9":"And the wife of Pharaoh said: “(This is) a comfort of the eye for me and for you. Don’t kill him, perhaps that he may be of benefit to us, or we may adopt him as a son.” They did not perceive (the result of that)","28:10":"And the heart of the mother of Moses became empty (from worry, except the thought of Moses). Surely, she was very near to disclose him (that the child was her son), had We not strengthened her heart with faith so that she might remain as one of the believers","28:11":"And she said to his (Moses’) sister: “Follow him.” So she watched him from a far place, while they did not perceive","28:12":"And We had already forbidden for him other suckling mothers, until she (sister came and) said: “Shall I direct you to the people of a family who will care for him for you, and they will look after him in a good manner?”","28:13":"Thus We restored him to his mother so that her eye might be delighted, not grieved and that she might know that the Promise of Allah is true. But most of them don’t know","28:14":"And when he attained his full strength and became perfect (in manhood), We bestowed on him judgment and knowledge. And thus We reward the good doers","28:15":"And he entered the city at a time when its people were unaware, and he found 2 men fighting – one was of his party (from the children of Israel), and the other one was of his foes. (The man) of his party asked him for help against the one who was of his foe, so Moses struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: “This is the work of Satan; surely, he is a plain misleading enemy.”","28:16":"He said: “My Lord! Surely, I have wronged myself, so forgive me.” Then We forgave him. Surely, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful","28:17":"He said: “My Lord! After this with which You have favored me, I shall never be a helper for the criminals!”","28:18":"So he became afraid in the city (waiting for his punishment) and was looking around, when suddenly the man who had sought his help yesterday, called him for his help again. Moses said to him: “Surely, you are a plain misguided person!”","28:19":"Then when he decided to seize the man who was an enemy to both of them, the man said: “O Moses! Do you want to kill me as you killed a man yesterday? You only want to become a tyrant in the land, and you don’t want to be of those who do right.”","28:20":"And then a man came running from the farthest end of the city. He said: “O Moses! Surely, the chiefs are taking counsel together about you to kill you, so escape. Truly, I am one of the good advisers to you.”","28:21":"So he escaped from there with fear to look around. He said: “My Lord! Save me from the wrongdoers!”","28:22":"When he went towards (the city of) Midian, he said: “It may be that my Lord will guide me to the Right Way.”","28:23":"And when he arrived at the water well of Midian, he found a group of men watering (their flocks), and he found 2 women besides them who were keeping back (their flocks). He said: “What is the matter with you?” They said: “We cannot water (our flocks) until the shepherds take away (their flocks). Our father is a very old man.”","28:24":"He watered (their flocks) for them, he turned back to shade, and said: “My Lord! Truly, I am in need of whatever good You bestow on me!”","28:25":"Then one of the 2 women came to him walking with shy. She said: “Surely, my father is calling you so that he may reward you for that you watered for us.” When he came to him and narrated the story to him, he said: “Don’t fear. You have escaped from the wrongdoers.”","28:26":"One of them (2 women) said: “O my father! Hire him! Surely, the best that you can hire who is strong, the trustworthy.”","28:27":"He said (to Moses): “Surely, I intend to wed to you one of these 2 daughters of mine with the condition that you serve me for 8 years, but if you complete 10 years, then it will be a favor from you. I don’t want to make it difficult for you. You will find me, if Allah wills, one of the righteous.”","28:28":"He (Moses) said: ‘That (is settled) between me and you. Whichever of the 2 terms I fulfill, let there be no injustice on me. Allah is the Surety over what we say.”","28:29":"When Moses fulfilled the term and was traveling with his family, he saw a fire in the direction of the mount Tur. He said to his family: “Wait, I have seen a fire; perhaps I may bring from there some information to you, or a burning brand of fire that you may warm yourselves.”","28:30":"So when he reached there (the fire), he was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place from the tree, (saying): “O Moses! Surely! I am Allah, the Lord of the worlds","28:31":"Throw your stick!” But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight and did not look back. (Allah said): “O Moses! Draw near and don’t fear. Surely, you are of those who are secure","28:32":"Put your hand in your bosom, it will come out (shinning) white without any harm, and draw your hand to you (whenever needed to be free) from fear. These are 2 evidences from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. Surely, they are rebellious people","28:33":"He said: “My Lord! Surely, I have killed a man from them and I fear that they will kill me","28:34":"My brother Aaron, he is more eloquent in speech than me, so send him with me as a helper to confirm me. Surely! I fear that they will deny me.”","28:35":"Allah said: “I will strengthen your arm with your brother and give power to both of you so that they shall not reach you. (Proceed) with Our signs. You 2 and those who follow you will be the victors.”","28:36":"When Moses came to them (Pharaoh and his chiefs) with Our clear signs, they said: “This is nothing but invented magic. We never heard this from our forefathers.”","28:37":"Moses said: “My Lord knows the one best who comes with guidance from Him, and who will have the happy end in the Hereafter. Surely, the wrongdoers will not be successful.”","28:38":"Pharaoh said: “O chiefs! I don’t know that you have any one worthy of worship other than me. O Haman! Kindle for me (a fire) on clay (to bake bricks) and set up a lofty tower for me so that I may look at the deity of Moses; and surely, I think that he (Moses) is one of the liars.”","28:39":"And he and his soldiers were arrogant in the land without right, and they thought that they would not return to Us","28:40":"So We seized him and his soldiers, and We threw them in the sea (and drowned them). So behold (O Muhammad) how was the end of the wrongdoers","28:41":"And We made them leaders who invite (people) to the fire, and on the Day of Resurrection, they will not be helped","28:42":"And We made a curse to follow them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection, they will be among the despised","28:43":"And indeed We gave Moses the Scripture (the Torah) after We had destroyed the previous generations as enlightenment for people, guidance, and a mercy so that they may remember","28:44":"And you (O Muhammad) were not present on the western side (of the mount) when We made the commandment clear to Moses and you were not among the witnesses","28:45":"But We created many generations (after Moses) and long time has passed over them. You (O Muhammad) were not a resident among the people of Midian, reciting Our Verses to them. But it is We Who is sending (messengers)","28:46":"And you (O Muhammad) were not at the side of the Tur mount when We called (Moses); but (provided you with news) as a Mercy from your Lord so that you may warn the people to whom no Warner had come before you, in order that they may remember","28:47":"so that if a calamity seizes them (people of Makkah) for what their hands have sent (the deeds), they may not be able to say: “Our Lord! Why You did not send us a Messenger? Then we would have followed Your Verses and would have been among the believers.”","28:48":"Now that the truth (Muhammad with his message) has come to them from Us, they say: “Why he is not given the like of what was given to Moses? Did they not disbelieve in what was given to Moses before? They say: “2 kinds of magic (the Torah and the Qur’an) are helping each other!” They say: “Surely! We disbelieve in both.”","28:49":"Say (to them, O Muhammad): “Then bring a book from Allah which is better guide than these 2 (the Torah and the Qur’an), I will follow it, if you are truthful.”","28:50":"But if they don’t answer to you, then know that they only follow their own desires. Who is more astray than the one who follows own desires without guidance from Allah? Allah does not guide the wrongdoers","28:51":"And indeed We have conveyed to them the Word (this Qur’an) in order that they may remember","28:52":"Those to whom We gave Scriptures before it, they believe in it (the Qur’an)","28:53":"And when it is recited to them, they say: “We believe in it. Surely, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed we were from those who submit to Allah (as Muslims) before it (like Abdullah bin Salam, Salman Al-Farsi).”","28:54":"They will be given their reward twice; because they are patient, repel evil with good, and spend (in charity) out of what We have provided them","28:55":"And when they hear evil vain talk, they withdraw from it and say: “To us are our deeds and to you are your deeds. Peace be on to you. We don’t seek the (way of the) ignorant.”","28:56":"Surely! You (O Muhammad) cannot guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. He knows the best of those who are guided","28:57":"And they say: “If we follow the guidance with you, we shall be snatched away from our land.” Have We not established a secure sanctuary (Makkah) for them where all kinds of fruits are brought as a provision from Ourselves? But most of them don’t know","28:58":"And how many towns We have destroyed which were thankless for their means of livelihood? Those residences of theirs have not been inhabited after them except a little. Surely! Allah is the Inheritor","28:59":"And your Lord would never destroy the towns until He had sent a Messenger to their mother town, reciting to them Our Verses. We would never destroy the towns unless their people had become wrongdoers","28:60":"And whatever you have been given from things are enjoyments and adornments of the worldly life; and that which is with Allah is better and will remain forever. Don’t you have sense","28:61":"Is it he whom We have promised an excellent Promise (Paradise) which he will find true, be like the one whom We have given to enjoy the luxuries of the worldly life and then on the Day of Resurrection, he will be among those who are brought up (for punishment)","28:62":"And (remember) the Day when He will call them and say: “Where are My partners (so-called) whom you used to assert?”","28:63":"Those about whom the Word will come true (to be punished), will say: \"Our Lord! These are they whom we led astray. We led them astray, as we were astray ourselves. We declare our innocence before You. It was not us that they worshipped.”","28:64":"And it will be said (to them): “Call upon your partners (of Allah).” So they will call upon them but they will not answer to them and they will see the punishment. They will wish if they had been guided","28:65":"And (remember) the Day (when Allah) will call them and says: “How did you answer the Messengers?”","28:66":"The news (of good answer) will be obscured to them on that Day and they will not be able to ask one another","28:67":"But as for him who repented, believed, and did righteous deeds, then hopefully he will be among those who are successful","28:68":"Your Lord creates whatever He wills and chooses. They don’t have any choice.

And We gave him such treasures that indeed their keys were a burden to a group of strong men. When his people said to him: “Don’t be glad. Surely! Allah does not like those who exult (jubilant with riches and ungrateful)","28:77":"Rather seek, with that (wealth) which Allah has given you, the home of the Hereafter, and don’t forget your portion of this world.

He is the owner of a great fortune.”","28:80":"But those who had been given the knowledge (of truth) said: “Woe to you! The reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds; and none shall attain it except those who are patient.”","28:81":"Then We caused the earth to swallow him along with his residing place. He had no group to help him against Allah, nor was he of those who could save themselves","28:82":"And those who had desired his position (of wealth) the day before began to say: “You don’t know that Allah enlarges the provision to whoever He pleases of His servants.

We were with you.” Is not Allah fully aware of what is in the hearts (of the people) of the worlds","29:11":"Surely, Allah knows those who believe, and surely, He knows the hypocrites","29:12":"And those who disbelieve say to those who believe: “Follow our way and we will surely bear your sins.” They will not bear anything from their sins. Surely, they are liars","29:13":"And surely, they shall bear their own loads and other loads with their own loads, and surely, they shall be questioned on the Day of Resurrection about their fabricated lies","29:14":"And indeed Allah sent Noah to his people and he stayed among them a 1,000 years less 50 years. The flood overtook them as they were wrongdoers","29:15":"Then We saved him and the people of the ship, and made it (the ship) a sign for the worlds","29:16":"And (remember) Abraham when he said to his people: “Worship Allah and fear Him, that is better for you if you understand","29:17":"You worship only idols besides Allah and you invent falsehood.

The love between you is only in the worldly life; but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, curse each other, your abode will be the fire, and you shall have no helper.”","29:26":"So Lot believed in him (Abraham). (Abraham) said: “Surely, I will emigrate for the sake of my Lord. He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.”","29:27":"We bestowed on him (Abraham), Isaac (son) and Jacob (grandson), and ordained Prophethood and the book in his offspring. We granted him his reward in this world, and in the Hereafter he will be among the righteous","29:28":"And (remember) Lot, when he said to his people: “Surely you are committing the worst sin; no one has preceded you in committing it in the worlds","29:29":"Surely, do you commit (sodomy) with men, rob travelers in the road, and practice every kind of evil deed in your gatherings?” But his people gave no answer except that they said: “Bring punishment of Allah upon us if you are one of the truthful.”","29:30":"He (Lot) said: “My Lord! Help me against the corrupt people.”","29:31":"And when Our Messengers (angels) came to Abraham with the glad tidings, they said: “Surely, we are going to destroy the people of this town, truly its people are wrongdoers.”","29:32":"(Abraham) said: “But Lot is in there.” They (angels) said: “We know better who is in there, we will surely save him and his family, except his wife, she will be of those who remain behind.”","29:33":"And when Our Messengers (angels) came to Lot, he was grieved because of them, felt distressed for them, and was unable (to protect them).

Worship Allah, hope (reward of good deeds) for the Last Day, and don’t commit mischief on the earth as corrupt.”","29:37":"But they denied him (Shuaib), so the earthquake seized them, and they became dead in their residences","29:38":"And Ad and Thamud (people)! Indeed (their destruction) is clearly apparent to you from their (ruined) residences. Satan made their deeds seem fair to them, and turned them away from the Right Way, though they were intelligent","29:39":"And (We destroyed) Korah, Pharaoh, and Haman. Indeed Moses came to them with clear evidences but they were arrogant in the land, and they could not escape Us","29:40":"So We seized all of them for their sins, against some of them We sent a violent wind with shower of stones (the people of Lot), some of them were overtaken by awful cry (Thamud or Shuaib’s people), some of them We caused the earth to swallow (like Korah), and some of them We drowned (the people of Noah or Pharaoh and his people). It was not Allah Who wronged them, but they were doing wrong to themselves","29:41":"The example of those who take protectors other than Allah is the example of a spider who builds (for itself) a house, but surely, the weakest of houses is the house of the spider; if they but knew","29:42":"Surely, Allah knows what things they invoke instead of Him.

After the war lays down its burden, then either show generosity (free them without ransom), or ransom (to benefit Islam). But if Allah had willed, He could certainly have won over them. But (He adapted this way) in order to test some of you with others. Those who are killed in the Way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost","47:5":"He will guide them and set their state right","47:6":"and admit them to Paradise which He has made known to them","47:7":"O you who believe!

(Are these) like those who shall reside forever in the fire and be given to drink boiling water so that it cuts up their intestines","47:16":"And among them there are some who listen to you (O Muhammad) till, when they go out from you, they say to those who have received knowledge: “What has he said just now?” Such are those Allah has sealed on their hearts and they follow their lusts (evil desires)","47:17":"Those who accept guidance, He will increase their guidance and bestow on them their piety","47:18":"Are they waiting for the Hour (of judgment) so that it should come upon them suddenly?
