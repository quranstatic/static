As for those who resume, they shall be the inmates of the Fire and they shall remain in it [forever]","2:276":"Allah brings usury to naught, but He makes charities flourish.

Then every soul shall be recompensed fully for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged","2:282":"O you who have faith! When you contract a loan for a specified term, write it down. Let a writer write between you with honesty, and let not the writer refuse to write as Allah has taught him. So let him write, and let the one who incurs the debt dictate, and let him be wary of Allah, his Lord, and not diminish anything from it. But if the debtor be feeble-minded, or weak, or incapable of dictating himself, then let his guardian dictate with honesty, and take as witness two witnesses from your men, and if there are not two men, then a man and two women —from those whom you approve as witnesses— so that if one of the two defaults the other will remind her. The witnesses must not refuse when they are called, and do not consider it wearisome to write it down, whether it be a big or a small sum, [as being lent] until its term. That is more just with Allah and more upright in respect to testimony, and the likeliest way to avoid doubt, unless it is an on the spot deal you transact between yourselves, in which case there is no sin upon you not to write it. Take witnesses when you make a deal, and let no harm be done to writer or witness, and if you did that, it would be sinful of you. Be wary of Allah and Allah shall teach you, and Allah has knowledge of all things","2:283":"If you are on a journey and cannot find a writer, then a retained pledge [shall suffice]. And if one of you entrusts to another, let him who is trusted deliver his trust, and let him be wary of Allah, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony; anyone who conceals it, his heart will indeed be sinful. And Allah knows best what you do","2:284":"To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth; and whether you disclose what is in your hearts or hide it, Allah will bring you to account for it. Then He will forgive whomever He wishes and punish whomever He wishes, and Allah has power over all things","2:285":"The Apostle has faith in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and all the faithful. Each [of them] has faith in Allah, His angels, His scriptures and His apostles. [They declare,] ‘We make no distinction between any of His apostles.’ And they say, ‘We hear and obey. Our Lord, forgive us, and toward You is the return.’","2:286":"Allah does not task any soul beyond its capacity. Whatever [good] it earns is to its benefit, and whatever [evil] it incurs is to its harm. ‘Our Lord! Take us not to task if we forget or make mistakes! Our Lord! Place not upon us a burden as You placed on those who were before us! Our Lord! Lay not upon us what we have no strength to bear! Excuse us and forgive us, and be merciful to us! You are our Master, so help us against the faithless lot!’","3:1":"Alif, Lam, Mim","3:2":"Allah—there is no god except Him— is the Living One, the All-sustainer","3:3":"He has sent down to you the Book with the truth confirming what was [revealed] before it, and He had sent down the Torah and the Evangel","3:4":"before as guidance for mankind, and He has sent down the Criterion.

There is no god except Him, the All-mighty, the All-wise","3:7":"It is He who has sent down to you the Book. Parts of it are definitive verses, which are the mother of the Book, while others are metaphorical. As for those in whose hearts is deviance, they pursue what is metaphorical in it, courting temptation and courting its interpretation. But no one knows its interpretation except Allah and those firmly grounded in knowledge; they say, ‘We believe in it; all of it is from our Lord.’ And none takes admonition except those who possess intellect","3:8":"[They say,] ‘Our Lord! Do not make our hearts swerve after You have guided us, and bestow Your mercy on us. Indeed You are the All-munificent","3:9":"Our Lord! You will indeed gather mankind on a day in which there is no doubt. Indeed Allah does not break His promise.’","3:10":"As for the faithless, neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them anything against Allah; it is they who will be fuel for the Fire","3:11":"as in the case of Pharaoh’s clan and those who were before them, who denied Our signs. So Allah seized them for their sins, and Allah is severe in retribution","3:12":"Say to the faithless, ‘You shall be overcome and mustered toward hell, and it is an evil resting place.’","3:13":"There was certainly a sign for you in the two hosts that met: one host fighting in the way of Allah and the other faithless, who saw them visibly twice as many. Allah strengthens with His help whomever He wishes. There is indeed a moral in that for those who have insight","3:14":"To mankind has been made to seem decorous the love of [worldly] desires, including women and children, accumulated piles of gold and silver, horses of mark, livestock, and farms. Those are the wares of the life of this world; but Allah—with Him is a good destination","3:15":"Say, ‘Shall I inform you of something better than that? For those who are Godwary there will be gardens near their Lord, with streams running in them, to remain in them [forever], and chaste mates, and Allah’s pleasure.’ And Allah sees best the servants","3:16":"Those who say, ‘Our Lord!

And whoever defies Allah’s signs [should know that] Allah is swift at reckoning","3:20":"So if they argue with you, say, ‘I have submitted my will to Allah, and [so has] he who follows me.’ And say to those who were given the Book and the uninstructed ones, ‘Do you submit?’ If they submit, they will certainly be guided; but if they turn away, then your duty is only to communicate; and Allah sees best the servants","3:21":"Those who defy Allah’s signs and kill the prophets unjustly, and kill those who call for justice from among the people, inform them of a painful punishment","3:22":"They are the ones whose works have failed in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers","3:23":"Have you not regarded those who were given a share of the Book, who are summoned to the Book of Allah in order that it may judge between them, whereat a part of them refuse to comply and they are disregardful","3:24":"That is because they say, ‘The Fire shall not touch us except for a number of days,’ and they have been misled in their religion by what they used to fabricate","3:25":"But how will it be [with them] when We gather them on a day in which there is no doubt, and every soul shall be recompensed fully for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged","3:26":"Say, ‘O Allah, Master of all sovereignty! You give sovereignty to whomever You wish, and strip of sovereignty whomever You wish; You make mighty whomever You wish, and You abase whomever You wish; all good is in Your hand.

Allah provides whomever He wishes without any reckoning.’","3:38":"Thereat Zechariah supplicated his Lord. He said, ‘My Lord! Grant me a good offspring from You!

They say, ‘Do we have any role in the matter?’ Say, ‘Indeed the matter belongs totally to Allah.’ They hide in their hearts what they do not disclose to you. They say, ‘Had we any role in the matter, we would not have been slain here.’ Say, ‘Even if you had remained in your houses, those destined to be slain would have set out toward the places where they were laid to rest, so that Allah may test what is in your breasts, and that He may purge what is in your hearts, and Allah knows best what is in the breasts.’","3:155":"Those of you who fled on the day when the two hosts met, only Satan had made them stumble because of some of their deeds. Certainly Allah has excused them, for Allah is all-forgiving, all-forbearing","3:156":"O you who have faith! Do not be like the faithless who say of their brethren, when they travel in the land or go into battle, ‘Had they stayed with us they would not have died or been killed,’ so that Allah may make it a regret in their hearts. But Allah gives life and brings death, and Allah sees best what you do","3:157":"If you are slain in the way of Allah, or die, surely forgiveness and mercy from Allah are better than what they amass","3:158":"And if you die or are slain, you will surely be mustered toward Allah","3:159":"It is by Allah’s mercy that you are gentle to them; and had you been harsh and hardhearted, surely they would have scattered from around you.

Indeed Allah loves those who trust in Him","3:160":"If Allah helps you, no one can overcome you, but if He forsakes you, who will help you after Him? So in Allah let all the faithful put their trust","3:161":"A prophet may not breach his trust, and whoever breaches his trust will bring his breaches on the Day of Resurrection; then every soul shall be recompensed fully for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged","3:162":"Is he who follows [the course of] Allah’s pleasure like him who earns Allah’s displeasure and whose refuge is hell, an evil destination","3:163":"They have ranks with Allah, and Allah sees best what they do","3:164":"Allah certainly favoured the faithful when He raised up among them an apostle from among themselves to recite to them His signs and to purify them, and to teach them the Book and wisdom, and earlier they had indeed been in manifest error","3:165":"What, when an affliction visits you —while you have inflicted twice as much— do you say, ‘How is this?’! Say, ‘This is from your own souls.’ Indeed Allah has power over all things","3:166":"What befell you on the day when the two hosts met, was by Allah’s permission, so that He may ascertain the faithful","3:167":"and ascertain the hypocrites. [When] they were told: ‘Come, fight in the way of Allah, or defend [yourselves], they said, ‘If we knew any fighting, surely we would have followed you.’ That day they were nearer to unfaith than to faith.

Then why did you kill them, should you be truthful?’","3:184":"But if they deny you, then before you [other] apostles have been denied, who came with manifest signs, holy writs, and an illuminating scripture","3:185":"Every soul shall taste death, and you will indeed be paid your full rewards on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is delivered from the Fire and admitted to paradise has certainly succeeded. The life of this world is nothing but the wares of delusion","3:186":"You will surely be tested in your possessions and your souls, and you will surely hear from those who were given the Book before you and from the polytheists much affront; but if you are patient and Godwary, that is indeed the steadiest of courses","3:187":"When Allah made a covenant with those who were given the Book: ‘You shall explain it for the people, and you shall not conceal it,’ they cast it behind their backs and sold it for a paltry gain.

It is such whose repentance Allah will accept, and Allah is all-knowing, all-wise","4:18":"But [acceptance of] repentance is not for those who go on committing misdeeds: when death approaches any of them, he says, ‘I repent now.’ Nor is it for those who die while they are faithless. For such We have prepared a painful punishment","4:19":"O you who have faith! It is not lawful for you to inherit women forcibly, and do not press them to take away part of what you have given them, unless they commit a gross indecency.

Indeed Allah is all-knowing, all-wise","4:25":"As for those of you who cannot afford to marry faithful free women, then [let them marry] from what you own, from among your faithful slave-women. Your faith is best known [only] to Allah; you are all [on a] similar [footing]. So marry them with their masters’ permission, and give them their dowries in an honourable manner —[such of them] as are chaste women, not licentious ones or those who take paramours. But on marrying, should they commit an indecent act, then there shall be for them [only] half the punishment for free women. This is for those of you who fear falling into fornication; but it is better that you be continent, and Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful","4:26":"Allah desires to explain [the laws] to you, and to guide you to the customs of those who were before you, and to turn toward you clemently, and Allah is all-knowing, all-wise","4:27":"Allah desires to turn toward you clemently, but those who pursue their [base] appetites desire that you fall into gross waywardness","4:28":"Allah desires to lighten your burden, for man was created weak","4:29":"O you who have faith!

Allah is indeed well aware of what you do","4:95":"Not equal are those of the faithful who sit back —excepting those who suffer from some disability— and those who wage jihad in the way of Allah with their possession and their persons.

The faithless are eager that you should be oblivious of your weapons and your baggage, so that they could assault you all at once.

Are you vindictive toward us for any reason except that we have faith in Allah and in what has been sent down to us, and in what was sent down before, and that most of you are transgressors?’","5:60":"Say, ‘Shall I inform you concerning something worse than that as a requital from Allah? Those whom Allah has cursed and with whom He is wrathful, and turned some of whom into apes and swine, and worshippers of the Rebel! Such are in a worse situation, and more astray from the right way.’","5:61":"When they come to you, they say, ‘We believe.’ Certainly they enter with disbelief and leave with it, and Allah knows best as to what they have been concealing","5:62":"You see many of them actively engaged in sin and aggression, and consuming illicit gains. Surely, evil is what they have been doing","5:63":"Why do not the rabbis and the scribes forbid them from sinful speech and consuming illicit gains? Surely, evil is what they have been working","5:64":"The Jews say, ‘Allah’s hand is tied up.’ Tied up be their hands, and cursed be they for what they say! Rather, His hands are wide open: He bestows as He wishes. Surely many of them will be increased by what has been sent to you from your Lord in rebellion and unfaith, and We have cast enmity and hatred amongst them until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they ignite the flames of war, Allah puts them out. They seek to cause corruption on the earth, and Allah does not like the agents of corruption","5:65":"Had the People of the Book believed and been Godwary, We would surely have absolved them of their misdeeds and admitted them into gardens of bliss","5:66":"Had they observed the Torah and the Evangel, and what was sent down to them from their Lord, they would surely have drawn nourishment from above them and from beneath their feet. There is an upright group among them, but evil is what many of them do","5:67":"O Apostle! Communicate that which has been sent down to you from your Lord, and if you do not, you will not have communicated His message, and Allah shall protect you from the people. Indeed Allah does not guide the faithless lot","5:68":"Say, ‘O People of the Book! You do not stand on anything until you observe the Torah and the Evangel and what was sent down to you from your Lord.’ Surely many of them will be increased by what has been sent down to you from your Lord in rebellion and unfaith. So do not grieve for the faithless lot","5:69":"Indeed the faithful, the Jews, the Sabaeans, and the Christians —those who have faith in Allah and the Last Day and act righteously— they will have no fear, nor will they grieve","5:70":"Certainly We took a pledge from the Children of Israel, and We sent apostles to them. Whenever an apostle brought them that which was not to their liking, they would impugn a part of them, and a part they would slay","5:71":"They supposed there would be no testing, so they became blind and deaf. Thereafter Allah accepted their repentance, yet [again] many of them became blind and deaf, and Allah sees best what they do","5:72":"They are certainly faithless who say, ‘Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary.’ But the Messiah had said, ‘O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Indeed whoever ascribes partners to Allah, Allah shall forbid him [entry into] paradise, and his refuge shall be the Fire, and the wrongdoers will not have any helpers.’","5:73":"They are certainly faithless who say, ‘Allah is the third [person] of a trinity,’ while there is no god except the One God. If they do not relinquish what they say, there shall befall the faithless among them a painful punishment","5:74":"Will they not repent to Allah and plead to Him for forgiveness? Yet Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful","5:75":"The Messiah, son of Mary, is but an apostle. Certainly [other] apostles have passed before him, and his mother was a truthful one. Both of them would eat food. Look how We clarify the signs for them, and yet, look, how they go astray","5:76":"Say, ‘Do you worship, besides Allah, what has no power to bring you any benefit or harm, while Allah—He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing?!’","5:77":"Say, ‘O People of the Book! Do not unduly exceed the bounds in your religion and do not follow the fancies of a people who went astray in the past, and led many astray, and [themselves] strayed from the right path.’","5:78":"The faithless among the Children of Israel were cursed on the tongue of David and Jesus son of Mary. That, because they would disobey and they used to commit transgression","5:79":"They would not forbid one another from the wrongs that they committed. Surely, evil is what they had been doing","5:80":"You see many of them fraternizing with the faithless. Surely evil is what they have sent ahead for their souls, as Allah is displeased with them and they shall remain in punishment [forever]","5:81":"Had they believed in Allah and the Prophet and what has been sent down to him, they would not have taken them for allies. But most of them are transgressors","5:82":"Surely You will find the most hostile of all people towards the faithful to be the Jews and the polytheists, and surely you will find the nearest of them in affection to the faithful to be those who say ‘We are Christians.’ That is because there are priests and monks among them, and because they are not arrogant","5:83":"When they hear what has been revealed to the Apostle, you see their eyes fill with tears because of the truth that they recognize. They say, ‘Our Lord, we believe; so write us down among the witnesses","5:84":"Why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us, eager as we are that our Lord should admit us among the righteous people?’","5:85":"So, for what they said, Allah requited them with gardens with streams running in them, to remain in them [forever], and that is the reward of the virtuous","5:86":"But those who are faithless and deny Our signs —they shall be the inmates of hell","5:87":"O you who have faith! Do not prohibit the good things that Allah has made lawful to you, and do not transgress. Indeed Allah does not like the transgressors","5:88":"Eat the lawful and good things Allah has provided you, and be wary of Allah in whom you have faith","5:89":"Allah shall not take you to task for what is frivolous in your oaths; but He shall take you to task for what you pledge in earnest. The atonement for it is to feed ten needy persons with the average food you give to your families, or their clothing, or the freeing of a slave. He who cannot afford [any of these] shall fast for three days. That is the atonement for your oaths when you vow. But keep your oaths. Thus does Allah clarify His signs for you so that you may give thanks","5:90":"O you who have faith! Indeed wine, gambling, idols and the divining arrows are abominations of Satan’s doing, so avoid them, so that you may be felicitous","5:91":"Indeed Satan seeks to cast enmity and hatred among you through wine and gambling, and to hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. Will you, then, relinquish","5:92":"And obey Allah and obey the Apostle, and beware; but if you turn your backs, then know that Our Apostle’s duty is only to communicate in clear terms","5:93":"There will be no sin upon those who have faith and do righteous deeds in regard to what they have eaten [in the past] so long as they are Godwary and faithful and do righteous deeds, and are further Godwary and faithful, and are further Godwary and virtuous. And Allah loves the virtuous","5:94":"O you who have faith! Allah will surely test you with some of the game within the reach of your hands and spears, so that Allah may know those who fear Him in secret. So whoever transgresses after that, there is a painful punishment for him","5:95":"O you who have faith! Do not kill any game when you are in pilgrim sanctity. Should any of you kill it intentionally, its atonement, the counterpart from cattle of what he has killed, as judged by two fair men among you, will be an offering brought to the Ka‘bah, or an atonement by feeding needy persons, or its equivalent in fasting, that he may taste the untoward consequences of his conduct. Allah has excused what is already past; but should anyone resume, Allah shall take vengeance on him, for Allah is all-mighty, avenger","5:96":"You are permitted the game of the sea and its food, a provision for you and for the caravans, but you are forbidden the game of the land so long as you remain in pilgrim sanctity, and be wary of Allah toward whom you will be gathered","5:97":"Allah has made the Ka‘bah, the Sacred House, a [means of] sustentation for mankind, and [also] the sacred month, the offering and the garlands, so that you may know that Allah knows whatever there is in the heavens and whatever there is in the earth, and that Allah has knowledge of all things","5:98":"Know that Allah is severe in retribution, and that Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful","5:99":"The Apostle’s duty is only to communicate and Allah knows whatever you disclose and whatever you conceal","5:100":"Say, ‘The good and the bad are not equal, though the abundance of the bad should amaze you.’ So be wary of Allah, O you who possess intellect, so that you may be felicitous","5:101":"O you who have faith! Do not ask about things which, if they are disclosed to you, will upset you. Yet if you ask about them while the Qur’an is being sent down, they shall be disclosed to you. Allah has excused it, and Allah is all-forgiving, all-forbearing","5:102":"Certainly some people asked about them before you and then came to disbelieve in them","5:103":"Allah has not prescribed any such thing as Bahira, Sa’ibah, WaYilah, or Ham; but those who are faithless fabricate lies against Allah, and most of them do not apply reason","5:104":"And when they are told, ‘Come to what Allah has sent down and [come] to the Apostle,’ they say, ‘Sufficient for us is what we have found our fathers following.’ What, even if their fathers did not know anything and were not guided","5:105":"O you who have faith! Take care of your own souls. He who strays cannot hurt you if you are guided. To Allah will be the return of you all, whereat He will inform you concerning what you used to do","5:106":"O you who have faith! The witness between you, when death approaches any of you, while making a bequest, shall be two fair men from among yourselves —or two from among others, if you are journeying in the land and the affliction of death visits you. You shall detain the two of them after the prayer, and, if you have any doubt, they shall vow by Allah, ‘We will not sell it for any gain, even if it were a relative, nor will we conceal the testimony of Allah, for then we would indeed be among the sinners.’","5:107":"But if it is found that both of them were guilty of a sin, then two others shall stand up in their place from among those nearest in kinship to the claimants and swear by Allah: ‘Our testimony is surely truer than their testimony, and we have not transgressed, for then we would indeed be among the wrongdoers.’","5:108":"That makes it likelier that they give the testimony in its genuine form, or fear that other oaths will be taken after their oaths. Be wary of Allah and listen, and Allah does not guide the transgressing lot","5:109":"The day Allah will gather the apostles and say, ‘What was the response to you?’ They will say, ‘We have no knowledge. Indeed You are knower of all that is Unseen.’","5:110":"When Allah will say, O Jesus son of Mary, remember My blessing upon you and upon your mother, when I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit, so you would speak to the people in the cradle and in adulthood, and when I taught you the Book and wisdom, the Torah and the Evangel, and when you would create from clay the form of a bird, with My leave, and you would breathe into it and it would become a bird, with My leave; and you would heal the blind and the leper, with My leave, and you would raise the dead, with My leave; and when I held off [the evil of] the Children of Israel from you when you brought them manifest proofs, whereat the faithless among them said, ‘This is nothing but plain magic.’","5:111":"And when I inspired the Disciples, [saying], ‘Have faith in Me and My apostle,’ they said, ‘We have faith. Bear witness that we are muslims.’","5:112":"When the Disciples said, ‘O Jesus son of Mary! Can your Lord send down to us a table from the sky?’ Said he, ‘Be wary of Allah, should you be faithful.’","5:113":"They said, ‘We desire to eat from it, and our hearts will be at rest: we shall know that you have told us the truth, and we shall be among the witnesses to it.’","5:114":"Said Jesus son of Mary, ‘O Allah! Our Lord! Send down to us a table from the sky, to be a festival for us, for the first ones and the last ones among us and as a sign from You, and provide for us; for You are the best of providers.’","5:115":"Allah said, ‘I will indeed send it down to you. But should any of you disbelieve after this, I will indeed punish him with a punishment such as I do not punish anyone in all creation.’","5:116":"And when Allah will say, ‘O Jesus son of Mary! Was it you who said to the people, ‘‘Take me and my mother for gods besides Allah’’?’ He will say, ‘Immaculate are You! It does not behoove me to say what I have no right to [say]. Had I said it, You would certainly have known it: You know whatever is in my self, and I do not know what is in Your Self. Indeed You are knower of all that is Unseen","5:117":"I did not say to them [anything] except what You had commanded me [to say]: ‘‘Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.’’ And I was a witness to them so long as I was among them. But when You had taken me away, You Yourself were watchful over them, and You are witness to all things","5:118":"If You punish them, they are indeed Your creatures; but if You forgive them, You are indeed the All-mighty, the All-wise.’","5:119":"Allah will say, ‘This day truthfulness shall benefit the truthful. For them there will be gardens with streams running in them, to remain in them forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is the great success.’","5:120":"To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever there is in them, and He has power over all things","6:1":"All praise belongs to Allah who created the heavens and the earth and made the darknesses and the light.

Then We destroyed them for their sins, and brought forth another generation after them","6:7":"Had We sent down to you a Book on paper so they could touch it with their [own] hands, [still] the faithless would have said, ‘This is nothing but plain magic.’","6:8":"And they say, ‘Why has not an angel been sent down to him?’ Were We to send down an angel, the matter would surely be decided, and then they would not be granted any respite","6:9":"And had We made him an angel, We would have surely made him a man, and We would have surely confounded them in regard to [the truth] that they confound","6:10":"Apostles were certainly derided before you. Then those who ridiculed them were besieged by what they used to deride","6:11":"Say, ‘Travel over the land, and then observe how was the fate of the deniers.’","6:12":"Say, ‘To whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth?’ Say, ‘To Allah. He has made mercy incumbent upon Himself. He will surely gather you on the Day of Resurrection, in which there is no doubt. Those who have ruined their souls will not have faith.’","6:13":"To Him belongs whatever abides in the night and the day, and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing","6:14":"Say, ‘Shall I take for guardian [anyone] other than Allah, the originator of the heavens and the earth, who feeds and is not fed?’ Say, ‘I have been commanded to be the first of those who submit [to Allah],’ and never be one of the polytheists","6:15":"Say, ‘Indeed, should I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a tremendous day.’","6:16":"Whoever is spared of it on that day, He has certainly been merciful to him, and that is the manifest success","6:17":"Should Allah visit you with some distress there is no one to remove it except Him; and should He bring you some good, then He has power over all things","6:18":"And He is the All-dominant over His servants, and He is the All-wise, the All-aware","6:19":"Say, ‘What thing is greatest as witness?’ Say, ‘Allah! [He is] witness between me and you, and this Qur’an has been revealed to me that I may warn thereby you and whomever it may reach.’ ‘Do you indeed bear witness that there are other gods besides Allah?’ Say, ‘I do not bear witness [to any such thing].’ Say, ‘Indeed He is the One God, and I indeed disown what you associate [with Him].’","6:20":"Those whom We have given the Book recognize him just as they recognize their sons.

When they come to you, to dispute with you, the faithless say, ‘These are nothing but myths of the ancients.’","6:26":"They dissuade [others] from [following] him, and [themselves] avoid him; yet they destroy no one except themselves, but they are not aware","6:27":"Were you to see when they are brought to a halt by the Fire, whereupon they will say, ‘If only we were sent back [into the world]! Then we will not deny the signs of our Lord, and we will be among the faithful!’","6:28":"Rather, now has become evident to them what they used to hide before. But were they to be sent back they would revert to what they were forbidden, and they are indeed liars","6:29":"They say, ‘There is nothing but our life of this world, and we shall not be resurrected.’","6:30":"Were you to see when they are stationed before their Lord. He will say, ‘Is this not a fact?’ They will say, ‘Yes, by our Lord!’ He will say, ‘So taste the punishment because of what you used to disbelieve.’","6:31":"They are certainly losers who deny the encounter with Allah. When the Hour overtakes them suddenly, they will say, ‘Alas for us, for what we neglected in it!’ And they will bear their burdens on their backs. Look! Evil is what they bear","6:32":"The life of the world is nothing but play and diversion, and the abode of the Hereafter is surely better for those who are Godwary.

Yet it is not you that they deny, but it is Allah’s signs that the wrongdoers impugn","6:34":"Apostles were certainly denied before you, yet they patiently bore being denied and tormented until Our help came to them. Nothing can change the words of Allah, and there have certainly come to you some of the accounts of the apostles","6:35":"And should their aversion be hard on you, find, if you can, a tunnel into the ground, or a ladder into sky, that you may bring them a sign. Had Allah wished, He would have brought them together on guidance. So do not be one of the ignorant","6:36":"Only those who listen will respond [to you]. As for the dead, Allah will resurrect them, then they will be brought back to Him","6:37":"They say, ‘Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say, ‘Allah is indeed able to send down a sign,’ but most of them do not know","6:38":"There is no animal on land, nor a bird that flies with its wings, but they are communities like yourselves. We have not omitted anything from the Book. Then they will be mustered toward their Lord","6:39":"Those who deny Our signs are deaf and dumb, in a manifold darkness. Allah leads astray whomever He wishes, and whomever He wishes He puts him on a straight path","6:40":"Say, ‘Tell me, should Allah’s punishment overtake you, or should the Hour overtake you, will you supplicate anyone other than Allah, should you be truthful","6:41":"Rather, Him you will supplicate, and He will remove that for which you supplicated Him, if He wishes, and you will forget what you ascribe [to Him] as [His] partners.’","6:42":"We have certainly sent [apostles] to nations before you, then We seized them with stress and distress so that they might entreat [Us]","6:43":"Why did they not entreat when Our punishment overtook them! But their hearts had hardened, and Satan had made to seem decorous to them what they had been doing","6:44":"So when they forgot what they had been admonished of, We opened for them the gates of all [good] things. When they rejoiced in what they were given, We seized them suddenly, whereat, behold, they were despondent","6:45":"Thus the wrongdoing lot were rooted out, and all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds","6:46":"Say, ‘Tell me, should Allah take away your hearing and your sight and set a seal on your hearts, which god other than Allah can bring it [back] to you?’ Look, how We paraphrase the signs variously; nevertheless they turn away","6:47":"Say, ‘Tell me, should Allah’s punishment overtake you suddenly or visibly, will anyone be destroyed except the wrongdoing lot?’","6:48":"We do not send the apostles except as bearers of good news and warners. As for those who are faithful and righteous, they will have no fear, nor will they grieve","6:49":"But as for those who deny Our signs, the punishment shall befall them because of the transgressions they used to commit","6:50":"Say, ‘I do not say to you that I possess the treasuries of Allah, nor do I know the Unseen, nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I follow only what is revealed to me.’ Say, ‘Are the blind one and the seer equal? So do you not reflect?’","6:51":"And warn by its means those who fear being mustered toward their Lord, besides whom they shall have neither any guardian nor any intercessor, so that they may be Godwary","6:52":"Do not drive away those who supplicate their Lord morning and evening desiring His face. Neither are you accountable for them in any way, nor are they accountable for you in any way, so that you may drive them away and thus become one of the wrongdoers","6:53":"Thus do We test them by means of one another so that they should say, ‘Are these the ones whom Allah has favoured from among us?!’ Does not Allah know best the grateful","6:54":"When those who have faith in Our signs come to you, say, ‘Peace to you! Your Lord has made mercy incumbent upon Himself: whoever of you commits an evil [deed] out of ignorance and then repents after that and reforms, then He is indeed all-forgiving, all-merciful.’","6:55":"Thus do We elaborate the signs, so that the way of the guilty may be exposed","6:56":"Say, ‘I have been forbidden to worship those whom you invoke besides Allah.’ Say, ‘I do not follow your desires, for then I will have gone astray, and I will not be among the [rightly] guided.’","6:57":"Say, ‘Indeed I stand on a manifest proof from my Lord and you have denied it.

Observe fully the measure and the balance, and do not cheat the people of their goods, and do not cause corruption on the earth after its restoration. That is better for you, if you are faithful","7:86":"And do not lie in wait on every road to threaten and bar from the way of Allah those who have faith in Him, seeking to make it crooked. And remember when you were few, and He multiplied you, and observe how was the fate of the agents of corruption","7:87":"If a group of you have believed in what I have been sent with, and a group have not believed, be patient until Allah judges between us, and He is the best of judges.’","7:88":"The elite of his people who were arrogant said, ‘O Shu‘ayb, we will surely expel you and the faithful who are with you from our town, or else you shall revert to our creed.’ He said, ‘What! Even if we should be unwilling","7:89":"We would be fabricating a lie against Allah should we revert to your creed after Allah had delivered us from it. It does not behoove us to return to it, unless Allah, our Lord, should wish so. Our Lord embraces all things in [His] knowledge. In Allah we have put our trust.’ ‘Our Lord! Judge justly between us and our people, and You are the best of judges!’","7:90":"The elite of his people who were faithless said, ‘If you follow Shu‘ayb, you will indeed be losers.’","7:91":"So the earthquake seized them, and they lay lifeless prostrate in their homes","7:92":"Those who impugned Shu‘ayb became as if they had never lived there. Those who impugned Shu‘ayb were themselves the losers","7:93":"So he abandoned them [to their fate] and said, ‘O my people! Certainly I communicated to you the messages of my Lord, and I was your well-wisher. So how should I grieve for a faithless lot?’","7:94":"We did not send a prophet to any town without visiting its people with stress and distress so that they might entreat [for Allah’s forgiveness]","7:95":"Then We changed the ill [conditions] to good until they multiplied [in numbers] and said, ‘Adversity and ease befell our fathers [too].’ Then We seized them suddenly while they were unaware","7:96":"If the people of the towns had been faithful and Godwary, We would have opened to them blessings from the heaven and the earth. But they denied; so We seized them because of what they used to earn","7:97":"Do the people of the towns feel secure from Our punishment overtaking them at night while they are asleep","7:98":"Do the people of the towns feel secure from Our punishment overtaking them at midday while they are playing around","7:99":"Do they feel secure from Allah’s devising? No one feels secure from Allah’s devising except the people who are losers","7:100":"Does it not dawn upon those who inherited the earth after its [former] inhabitants that if We wish We will punish them for their sins, and set a seal on their hearts so they would not hear","7:101":"These are the towns some of whose accounts We recount to you. Their apostles certainly brought them manifest proofs, but they were not the ones to believe in what they had denied earlier. Thus does Allah put a seal on the hearts of the faithless","7:102":"We did not find in most of them any [loyalty to] covenants. Indeed We found most of them to be transgressors","7:103":"Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his elite, but they wronged them. So observe how was the fate of the agents of corruption","7:104":"And Moses said, ‘O Pharaoh, I am indeed an apostle from the Lord of all the worlds","7:105":"It behooves me to say nothing about Allah except the truth. I certainly bring you a manifest proof from your Lord. So let the Children of Israel go with me.’","7:106":"He said, ‘If you have brought a sign, produce it, should you be truthful.’","7:107":"Thereat he threw down his staff, and behold, it became a manifest python","7:108":"Then he drew out his hand, and behold, it was white to the onlookers","7:109":"The elite of Pharaoh’s people said, ‘This is indeed an expert magician","7:110":"he seeks to expel you from your land.’ ‘So what do you advise?’","7:111":"They said, ‘Put him and his brother off for a while, and send heralds to the cities","7:112":"to bring you every expert magician.’","7:113":"And the magicians came to Pharaoh. They said, ‘We shall indeed have a reward if we were to be the victors?’","7:114":"He said, ‘Of course! And indeed you shall be among those near [to me].’","7:115":"They said, ‘O Moses, will you throw [first], or shall we throw?’","7:116":"He said, ‘Throw [yours].’ So when they threw, they bewitched the people’s eyes and overawed them, producing a tremendous magic","7:117":"And We signalled to Moses: ‘Throw down your staff.’ And behold, it was swallowing what they had faked","7:118":"So the truth came out, and what they had wrought was reduced to naught","7:119":"Thereat they were vanquished, and they retreated, humiliated","7:120":"And the magicians fell down in prostration","7:121":"They said, ‘We have believed in the Lord of all the worlds","7:122":"the Lord of Moses and Aaron.’","7:123":"Pharaoh said, ‘Do you profess faith in Him before I may permit you? It is indeed a plot you have devised in the city to expel its people from it. Soon you will know [the consequences]","7:124":"Surely I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and then I will surely crucify all of you.’","7:125":"They said, ‘Indeed we shall return to our Lord","7:126":"You are vindictive toward us only because we have believed in the signs of our Lord, when they came to us.’ ‘Our Lord! Pour patience upon us, and grant us to die as muslims.’","7:127":"The elite of Pharaoh’s people said, ‘Will you leave Moses and his people to cause corruption in the land, and to abandon you and your gods?’ He said, ‘We will kill their sons and spare their women, and indeed we are dominant over them.’","7:128":"Moses said to his people, ‘Turn to Allah for help and be patient. The earth indeed belongs to Allah, and He gives its inheritance to whomever He wishes of His servants, and the outcome will be in favour of the Godwary.’","7:129":"They said, ‘We were tormented before you came to us and [also] after you came to us.’ He said, ‘Maybe your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land, and then He will see how you act.’","7:130":"Certainly We afflicted Pharaoh’s clan with droughts and loss of produce, so that they may take admonition","7:131":"But whenever any good came to them, they would say, ‘This is our due.’ And if any ill visited them, they took it for ill omens attending Moses and those who were with him. (Look! Indeed the cause of their ill omens is with Allah, but most of them do not know)","7:132":"And they said, ‘Whatever sign you may bring us to bewitch us, we are not going to believe you.’","7:133":"So We sent against them a flood and locusts, lice, frogs and blood, as distinct signs. But they acted arrogantly, and they were a guilty lot","7:134":"Whenever a plague fell upon them, they would say, ‘O Moses, invoke your Lord for us by the covenant He has made with you. If you remove the plague from us, we will certainly believe in you and let the Children of Israel go along with you.’","7:135":"But when We had removed the plague from them until a term that they should have completed, behold, they broke their promise","7:136":"So We took vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea, for they denied Our signs and were oblivious to them","7:137":"We made the people who were abased the heirs to the east and west of the land which We had blessed, and your Lord’s best word [of promise] was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of their patience, and We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people had built and what they used to erect","7:138":"We carried the Children of Israel across the sea, whereat they came upon a people cleaving to certain idols that they had. They said, ‘O Moses, make for us a god like the gods that they have.’ He said, ‘You are indeed an ignorant lot","7:139":"What they are engaged in is indeed bound to perish, and what they have been doing shall come to naught.’","7:140":"He said, ‘Shall I find you a god other than Allah, while He has graced you over all the nations?’","7:141":"And when We delivered you from Pharaoh’s clan who inflicted on you a terrible torment, slaughtering your sons and sparing your women, and there was a great test in that from your Lord","7:142":"And We made an appointment with Moses for thirty nights, and completed them with ten [more]; thus the tryst of his Lord was completed in forty nights. And Moses said to Aaron, his brother, ‘Be my successor among my people, and set things right and do not follow the way of the agents of corruption.’","7:143":"When Moses arrived at Our tryst and his Lord spoke to him, he said, ‘My Lord, show [Yourself] to me, that I may look at You!’ He said, ‘You shall not see Me. But look at the mountain: if it abides in its place, then you will see Me.’ So when his Lord disclosed Himself to the mountain, He levelled it, and Moses fell down swooning. And when he recovered, he said, ‘Immaculate are You! I turn to You in penitence, and I am the first of the faithful.’","7:144":"He said, ‘O Moses, I have chosen you over the people with My messages and My speech. So take what I give you, and be among the grateful.’","7:145":"And We wrote for him in the Tablets advice concerning all things and an elaboration of all things, [and We said], ‘Hold on to them with power, and bid your people to hold on to the best of [what is in] them. Soon I shall show you the abode of the transgressors","7:146":"Soon I shall turn away from My signs those who are unduly arrogant in the earth: [even] though they should see every sign, they will not believe in it, and if they see the way of rectitude they will not take it as [their] way, and if they see the way of error they will take it as [their] way. That is because they deny Our signs and are oblivious to them.’","7:147":"Those who deny Our signs and the encounter of the Hereafter, their works have failed. Shall they be requited except for what they used to do","7:148":"The people of Moses took up in his absence a calf [cast] from their ornaments —a body that gave out a lowing sound. Did they not regard that it did not speak to them, nor did it guide them to any way? They took it up [for worship] and they were wrongdoers","7:149":"But when they became remorseful and realised they had gone astray, they said, ‘Should our Lord have no mercy on us, and forgive us, we will be surely among the losers.’","7:150":"And when Moses returned to his people, angry and indignant, he said, ‘Evil has been your conduct in my absence! Would you hasten on the edict of your Lord?’ He threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the head, pulling him towards himself. He said, ‘Son of my mother, indeed this people thought me to be weak, and they were about to kill me. So do not let the enemies gloat over me, and do not take me with the wrongdoing lot.’","7:151":"He said, ‘My Lord, forgive me and my brother, and admit us into Your mercy, for You are the most merciful of the merciful","7:152":"Indeed those who took up the calf [for worship] shall be overtaken by their Lord’s wrath and abasement in the life of the world.’ Thus do We requite the fabricators [of lies]","7:153":"Yet [to] those who commit misdeeds but repent after that, and believe, —indeed, after that, your Lord shall surely be all-forgiving, all-merciful","7:154":"And when Moses’ indignation abated, he picked up the tablets whose inscriptions contained guidance and mercy for those who are in awe of their Lord","7:155":"Moses chose seventy men from his people for Our tryst, and when the earthquake seized them, he said, ‘My Lord, had You wished, You would have destroyed them and me before.

Evil indeed is what they have been doing","9:10":"They observe toward a believer neither kinship nor covenant, and it is they who are the transgressors","9:11":"Yet if they repent and maintain the prayer and give the zakat, then they are your brethren in faith.

Allah has turned aside their hearts, for they are a people who do not understand","9:128":"There has certainly come to you an apostle from among yourselves. Grievous to him is your distress; he has deep concern for you, and is most kind and merciful to the faithful","9:129":"But if they turn their backs [on you], say, ‘Allah is sufficient for me. There is no god except Him. In Him I have put my trust and He is the Lord of the Great Throne.’","10:1":"Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the signs of the Wise Book","10:2":"Does it seem odd to these people that We have revealed to a man from among themselves, [declaring], ‘Warn mankind, and give good news to the faithful that they are in good standing with their Lord’? The faithless say, ‘This is indeed a plain magician.’","10:3":"Indeed your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and then settled on the Throne, directing the command. There is no intercessor, except by His leave. That is Allah, your Lord! So worship Him. Will you not then take admonition","10:4":"To Him will be the return of you all —[that is] Allah’s true promise. Indeed He originates the creation, then He will bring it back that He may reward those who have faith and do righteous deeds with justice. As for the faithless, they shall have boiling water for drink, and a painful punishment because of what they used to defy","10:5":"It is He who made the sun a radiance and the moon a light, and ordained its phases that you might know the number of years and the calculation [of time]. Allah did not create all that except with reason. He elaborates the signs for a people who have knowledge","10:6":"Indeed in the alternation of night and day, and whatever Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are surely signs for a people who are Godwary","10:7":"Indeed those who do not expect to encounter Us and who are pleased with the life of this world and satisfied with it, and those who are oblivious of Our signs","10:8":"—it is they whose refuge shall be the Fire because of what they used to earn","10:9":"Indeed those who have faith and do righteous deeds, their Lord guides them by the means of their faith. Streams will run for them in gardens of bliss","10:10":"Their call therein will be, ‘O Allah! Immaculate are You!’ and their greeting therein will be, ‘Peace!’ and their concluding call, ‘All praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.’","10:11":"Were Allah to hasten ill for mankind with their haste for good, their term would have been over. But We leave those who do not expect to encounter Us bewildered in their rebellion","10:12":"When distress befalls man, he supplicates Us, [lying] on his side, sitting, or standing; but when We remove his distress, he passes on as if he had never supplicated Us concerning the distress that had befallen him. To the profligate is thus presented as decorous what they have been doing","10:13":"Certainly We destroyed [several] generations before you when they perpetrated wrongs: their apostles brought them manifest proofs, but they would not have faith. Thus do We requite the guilty lot","10:14":"Then We made you successors on the earth after them that We may observe how you will act","10:15":"When Our manifest signs are recited to them, those who do not expect to encounter Us say, ‘Bring a Qur’an other than this, or alter it.’ Say, ‘I may not alter it of my own accord. I follow only what is revealed to me. Indeed should I disobey my Lord, I fear the punishment of a tremendous day.’","10:16":"Say, ‘Had Allah [so] wished, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you, for I have dwelled among you for a lifetime before it. Do you not apply reason?’","10:17":"So who is a greater wrongdoer than him who fabricates a lie against Allah, or denies His signs? Indeed the guilty will not be felicitous","10:18":"They worship besides Allah that which neither causes them any harm, nor brings them any benefit, and they say, ‘These are our intercessors with Allah.’ Say, ‘Will you inform Allah about something He does not know in the heavens or on the earth?’ Immaculate is He and exalted above [having] any partners that they ascribe [to Him]","10:19":"Mankind were but a single [religious] community; then they differed. And were it not for a prior decree of your Lord, decision would have been made between them concerning that about which they differ","10:20":"They say, ‘Why has not some sign been sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say, ‘[The knowledge of] the Unseen belongs only to Allah. So wait. I too am waiting along with you.’","10:21":"When We let people taste [Our] mercy after a distress that has befallen them, behold, they scheme against Our signs! Say, ‘Allah is more swift at devising.’ Indeed Our messengers write down what you scheme","10:22":"It is He who carries you across land and sea. When you are in the ships, and they sail with them with a favourable wind, rejoicing in it, there comes upon them a tempestuous wind and waves assail them from every side, and they think that they are besieged, they invoke Allah putting exclusive faith in Him, ‘If You deliver us from this, we will surely be among the grateful.’","10:23":"But when He delivers them, behold, they commit violations on the earth unduly! O mankind! Your violations are only to your own detriment. [These are] the wares of the life of this world; then to Us will be your return, whereat We will inform you concerning what you used to do","10:24":"The parable of the life of this world is that of water which We send down from the sky. It mingles with the earth’s vegetation from which humans and cattle eat. When the earth puts on its luster and is adorned, and its inhabitants think they have power over it, Our edict comes to it, by night or day, whereat We turn it into a mown field, as if it did not flourish the day before. Thus do We elaborate the signs for a people who reflect","10:25":"Allah invites to the abode of peace, and He guides whomever He wishes to a straight path","10:26":"Those who are virtuous shall receive the best reward and an enhancement. Neither dust nor abasement shall overcast their faces. They shall be the inhabitants of paradise, and they shall remain in it [forever]","10:27":"For those who have committed misdeeds, the requital of a misdeed shall be its like, and they shall be overcast by abasement. They shall have no one to protect [them] from Allah. [They will be] as if their faces were covered with dark patches of the night. They shall be the inmates of the Fire, and they shall remain in it [forever]","10:28":"On the day when We gather them all together, We shall say to those who ascribe partners [to Allah], ‘Stay where you are —you and your partners!’ Then We shall set them apart from one another, and their partners will say, ‘It was not us that you worshipped","10:29":"Allah suffices as a witness between you and us. We were indeed unaware of your worship.’","10:30":"There every soul will examine what it has sent in advance, and they will be returned to Allah, their real master, and what they used to fabricate will forsake them","10:31":"Say, ‘Who provides for you out of the sky and the earth? Who controls [your] hearing and sight, and who brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living, and who directs the command?’ They will say, ‘Allah.’ Say, ‘Will you not then be wary [of Him]?’","10:32":"That, then, is Allah, your true Lord. So what is there after the truth except error? Then where are you being led away","10:33":"Thus the word of your Lord became due against those who transgress that they shall not have faith","10:34":"Say, ‘Is there anyone among your partners who originates the creation and then brings it back?’ Say, ‘Allah originates the creation, then He will bring it back.’ Then where do you stray","10:35":"Say, ‘Is there anyone among your partners who may guide to the truth?’ Say, ‘Allah guides to the truth. Is He who guides to the truth worthier to be followed, or he who is not guided unless he is shown the way? What is the matter with you? How do you judge?’","10:36":"Most of them just follow conjecture; indeed conjecture is no substitute for the truth. Indeed Allah knows best what they do","10:37":"This Qur’an could not have been fabricated by anyone besides Allah; rather it is a confirmation of what was [revealed] before it, and an elaboration of the Book, there is no doubt in it, from the Lord of all the worlds","10:38":"Do they say, ‘He has fabricated it?’ Say, ‘Then bring a surah like it, and invoke whomever you can, besides Allah, should you be truthful.’","10:39":"Rather, they deny that whose knowledge they do not comprehend, and whose explanation has not yet come to them. Those who were before them denied likewise. So observe how was the fate of the wrongdoers","10:40":"Some of them believe in it, and some of them do not believe in it, and your Lord best knows the agents of corruption","10:41":"If they deny you, say, ‘My deeds belong to me and your deeds belong to you: you are absolved of what I do and I am absolved of what you do.’","10:42":"There are some of them who prick up their ears at you. But can you make the deaf hear even if they do not apply reason","10:43":"And there are some of them who observe you. But can you guide the blind even if they do not perceive","10:44":"Indeed Allah does not wrong people in the least; rather it is people who wrong themselves","10:45":"On the day He will gather them [it will be] as if they had not remained [in the world] except for an hour of the day getting acquainted with one another. They are certainly losers who deny the encounter with Allah, and they are not guided","10:46":"Whether We show you a part of what We promise them, or take you away [before that], [in any case] their return will be to Us. Then Allah will be witness to what they do","10:47":"There is an apostle for every nation; so when their apostle comes, judgement is made between them with justice, and they are not wronged","10:48":"They say, ‘When will this promise be fulfilled, should you be truthful?’","10:49":"Say, ‘I have no control over any benefit for myself nor [over] any harm except what Allah may wish. There is a time for every nation: when their time comes, they shall not defer it by a single hour nor shall they advance it.’","10:50":"Say, ‘Tell me, should His punishment overtake you by night or day, [you will not be able to avert it]; so what part of it do the guilty seek to hasten?’","10:51":"‘What! Do you believe it when it has befallen? Now? While you would seek to hasten it [earlier]?!’","10:52":"Then it will be said to those who were wrongdoers, ‘Taste the everlasting punishment. Shall you be requited except for what you used to earn?’","10:53":"They inquire of you, ‘Is it true?’ Say, ‘Yes! By my Lord, it is true, and you cannot thwart [Him].’","10:54":"Were any soul that has done wrong to possess whatever there is on the earth, it would surely offer it for ransom. They will hide their remorse when they sight the punishment; and judgement will be made between them with justice and they will not be wronged","10:55":"Look! To Allah indeed belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Look! Allah’s promise is indeed true; but most of them do not know","10:56":"It is He who gives life and brings death, and to Him you shall be brought back","10:57":"O mankind! There has certainly come to you an advice from your Lord, and a cure for what is in the breasts, and a guidance and mercy for the faithful","10:58":"Say, ‘In Allah’s grace and His mercy— let them rejoice in that! It is better than what they amass.’","10:59":"Say, ‘Have you regarded what Allah has sent down for you of [His] provision, whereupon you made some of it unlawful and [some] lawful?’ Say, ‘Did Allah give you the sanction [to do so], or do you fabricate a lie against Allah?’","10:60":"What is the idea of those who fabricate lies against Allah [concerning their situation] on the Day of Resurrection? Indeed Allah is gracious to mankind, but most of them do not give thanks","10:61":"You do not engage in any work, neither do you recite any part of the Qur’an, nor do you perform any deed without Our being witness over you when you are engaged therein. Not an atom’s weight escapes your Lord in the earth or in the sky, nor [is there] anything smaller than that nor bigger, but it is in a manifest Book","10:62":"Look! The friends of Allah will indeed have no fear nor will they grieve","10:63":"—Those who have faith, and are Godwary","10:64":"For them is good news in the life of this world and in the Hereafter. (There is no altering the words of Allah.) That is the great success","10:65":"Do not grieve at their remarks; indeed all might belongs to Allah; He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing","10:66":"Look! To Allah indeed belongs whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth. And what do they pursue who invoke partners besides Allah? They merely follow conjectures and they just make surmises","10:67":"It is He who made the night for you, that you may rest in it, and the day to provide visibility. There are indeed signs in that for people who listen","10:68":"They say, ‘Allah has taken a son!’ Immaculate is He! He is the All-sufficient. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. You have no authority for this [statement]. Do you attribute to Allah what you do not know","10:69":"Say, ‘Indeed those who fabricate lies against Allah will not be felicitous.’","10:70":"An enjoyment in this world; then to Us shall be their return, then We shall make them taste the severe punishment because of what they used to defy","10:71":"Relate to them the account of Noah when he said to his people, ‘O my people! If my stay [among you] be hard on you and [also] my reminding you of Allah’s signs, [for my part] I have put my trust in Allah. So conspire together, along with your partners, leaving nothing vague in your plan, then carry it out against me without giving me any respite","10:72":"If you turn your back [on me], I do not ask any reward from you; my reward lies only with Allah and I have been commanded to be of those who submit [to Allah].’","10:73":"But they impugned him. So We delivered him and those who were with him in the ark and We made them the successors, and We drowned those who denied Our signs. So observe how was the fate of those who were warned","10:74":"Then after him We sent [other] apostles to their people. They brought them manifest proofs, but they would not believe something they had denied before. Thus do We seal the hearts of the transgressors","10:75":"Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his elite with Our signs, but they acted arrogantly and they were a guilty lot","10:76":"When the truth from Us came to them, they said, ‘This is indeed plain magic!’","10:77":"Moses said, ‘Do you say of the truth when it comes to you [that it is magic]? Is this magic? Magicians do not find salvation.’","10:78":"They said, ‘Have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our fathers following, so that supremacy may be yours in the land? We will not believe in the two of you.’","10:79":"Pharaoh said, ‘Bring me every expert magician.’","10:80":"So when the magicians came, Moses said to them, ‘Throw down what you have to throw.’","10:81":"So when they threw down [their sticks and ropes], Moses said, ‘What you have produced is magic. Indeed Allah will bring it to naught presently. Indeed Allah does not foster the efforts of those who cause corruption","10:82":"Allah will confirm the truth with His words, though the guilty should be averse.’","10:83":"But none believed in Moses except some youths from among his people, for the fear of Pharaoh and his elite that he would persecute them. For Pharaoh was indeed a tyrant in the land, and indeed he was an unrestrained [despot]","10:84":"And Moses said, ‘O my people! If you have faith in Allah, put your trust in Him, if you have submitted [to Him].’","10:85":"Whereat they said, ‘In Allah we have put our trust.’ ‘Our Lord! Do not make us a [means of] test for the wrongdoing lot","10:86":"and deliver us by Your mercy from the faithless lot.’","10:87":"We revealed to Moses and his brother [saying], ‘Settle your people in the city, and let your houses face each other, and maintain the prayer, and give good news to the faithful.’","10:88":"Moses said, ‘Our Lord! You have given Pharaoh and his elite glamour and wealth in the life of this world, our Lord, that they may lead [people] astray from Your way! Our Lord! Blot out their wealth and harden their hearts so that they do not believe until they sight the painful punishment.’","10:89":"Said He, ‘Your supplication has already been granted. So be steadfast, and do not follow the way of those who do not know.’","10:90":"We carried the Children of Israel across the sea, whereat Pharaoh and his troops pursued them out of defiance and aggression. When overtaken by drowning, he called out, ‘I believe that there is no god except Him in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am one of those who submit [to Him]!’","10:91":"[He was told,] ‘What! Now? When you have been disobedient heretofore and were among the agents of corruption","10:92":"So today We shall deliver your body so that you may be a sign for those who come after you.’ Indeed many of the people are oblivious to Our signs","10:93":"Certainly We settled the Children of Israel in a worthy settlement and We provided them with all the good things, and they did not differ until [after] the knowledge had come to them. Your Lord will indeed judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that about which they used to differ","10:94":"So if you are in doubt about what We have sent down to you, ask those who read the Book [revealed] before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord; so do not be among the skeptics","10:95":"And do not be of those who deny the signs of Allah, [for] then you shall be among the losers","10:96":"Indeed those against whom your Lord’s judgement has become due will not have faith","10:97":"even though every sign were to come to them, until they sight the painful punishment","10:98":"Why has there not been any town that might believe, so that its belief might benefit it, except the people of Jonah? When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the life of this world, and We provided for them for a while","10:99":"And had your Lord wished, all those who are on earth would have believed. Would you then force people until they become faithful","10:100":"No soul may have faith except by Allah’s leave, and He lays defilement on those who do not apply reason","10:101":"Say, ‘Observe what is in the heavens and the earth.’ But neither signs nor warnings avail a people who have no faith","10:102":"Do they await anything except the like of the days of those who passed away before them? Say, ‘Then wait! I too am waiting along with you.’","10:103":"Then We shall deliver Our apostles and those who have faith. Thus it is a must for Us to deliver the faithful","10:104":"Say, ‘O people! if you are in doubt about my religion, then [know that] I do not worship those whom you worship besides Allah. Rather I worship only Allah, who causes you to die, and I have been commanded to be among the faithful","10:105":"and that: ‘‘Dedicate yourself to the religion, as a á¸¥ana«f, and never be one of the polytheists","10:106":"Nor invoke besides Allah that which neither benefits you nor can do you any harm. For if you do so, then you will indeed be among the wrongdoers.’’ ’","10:107":"Should Allah visit you with some distress, there is no one to remove it except Him; and should He desire any good for you, none can stand in the way of His grace: He grants it to whomever He wishes of His servants, and He is the All-forgiving, the All-merciful","10:108":"Say, ‘O mankind! The truth has already come to you from your Lord. Whoever is guided, is guided only for [the good of] his own soul, and whoever goes astray, goes astray only to its detriment, and it is not my business to watch over you.’","10:109":"And follow that which is revealed to you, and be patient until Allah issues [His] judgement, and He is the best of judges","11:1":"Alif, Lam, Ra. [This is] a Book, whose signs have been made definitive and then elaborated, from One [who is] all-wise, all-aware","11:2":"declaring: ‘Worship no one but Allah. I am indeed a warner from Him to you and a bearer of good news","11:3":"Plead with your Lord for forgiveness, then turn to Him penitently. He will provide you with a good provision for a specified term and grant His grace to every meritorious person. But if you turn your backs [on Him], indeed I fear for you the punishment of a terrible day","11:4":"To Allah will be your return, and He has power over all things.’","11:5":"Look! They fold up their breasts to hide [their secret feelings] from Him. Look! When they draw their cloaks over their heads, He knows whatever they keep secret and whatever they disclose. Indeed He knows best whatever is in the breasts","11:6":"There is no animal on the earth, but that its sustenance lies with Allah, and He knows its [enduring] abode and its temporary place of lodging. Everything is in a manifest Book","11:7":"It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days —and His Throne was [then] upon the waters— that He may test you [to see] which of you is best in conduct. Yet if you say, ‘You will indeed be raised up after death,’ the faithless will surely say, ‘This is nothing but plain magic.’","11:8":"And if We defer their punishment until a certain time, they will surely say, ‘What holds it back?’ Look! On the day it overtakes them it shall not be turned away from them, and they will be besieged by what they used to deride","11:9":"If We let man taste a mercy from Us, and then withdraw it from him, he becomes despondent, ungrateful","11:10":"And if We let him have a taste of Our blessings after adversities have befallen him, he will surely say, ‘All ills have left me.’ Indeed he becomes an exultant braggart","11:11":"excepting those who are patient and do righteous deeds. For such there will be forgiveness and a great reward","11:12":"[Look out] lest you should disregard aught of what has been revealed to you, and be upset because they say, ‘Why has not a treasure been sent down to him, or [why does] not an angel accompany him?’ You are only a warner, and Allah watches over all things","11:13":"Do they say, ‘He has fabricated it?’ Say, ‘Then bring ten surahs like it, fabricated, and invoke whomever you can, besides Allah, should you be truthful.’","11:14":"But if they do not respond to you, know that it has been sent down by Allah’s knowledge, and that there is no god except Him. Will you, then, submit [to Allah]","11:15":"As for those who desire the life of this world and its glitter, We will recompense them fully for their works therein, and they shall not be underpaid in it","11:16":"They are the ones for whom there shall be nothing in the Hereafter but Fire: what they had accomplished in the world has failed, and their works have come to naught","11:17":"Is he who stands on a manifest proof from his Lord, and whom a witness of his own [family] follows? And before him there was the Book of Moses, a guide and mercy. It is they who have faith in it, and whoever defies him from among the factions, the Fire is their tryst. So do not be in doubt about it; it is the truth from your Lord, but most people do not have faith","11:18":"And who is a greater wrongdoer than him who fabricates a lie against Allah? They shall be presented before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, ‘It is these who lied against their Lord.’ Look! The curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers","11:19":"—those who bar [others] from the way of Allah, and seek to make it crooked, and disbelieve in the Hereafter","11:20":"They cannot thwart [Allah] on the earth, nor do they have besides Allah any guardian. For them the punishment shall be doubled, for they could neither listen, nor did they use to see","11:21":"They are the ones who have ruined their souls, and what they used to fabricate has forsaken them","11:22":"Undoubtedly, they are the ones who will be the biggest losers in the Hereafter","11:23":"Indeed those who have faith and do righteous deeds and are humble before their Lord —they shall be the inhabitants of paradise, and they shall remain in it [forever]","11:24":"The parable of the two parties is that of one who is blind and deaf and one who sees and hears. Are they equal in comparison? Will you not then take admonition","11:25":"Certainly We sent Noah to his people [to declare]: ‘Indeed I am a manifest warner to you","11:26":"Worship none but Allah. Indeed I fear for you the punishment of a painful day.’","11:27":"But the elite of the faithless from among his people said, ‘We do not see you to be anything but a human being like ourselves, and we do not see anyone following you except those who are simpleminded riffraff from our midst. Nor do we see that you have any merit over us. Rather we consider you to be liars.’","11:28":"He said, ‘O my people! Tell me, should I stand on a manifest proof from my Lord, and He has granted me His own mercy —though it should be invisible to you— shall we force it upon you while you are averse to it","11:29":"O my people! I do not ask you any material reward for it. My reward lies only with Allah. But I will not drive away those who have faith. Indeed they will encounter their Lord. But I see that you are an ignorant lot","11:30":"O my people! Who would come to my help against Allah were I to drive them away? Will you not then take admonition","11:31":"I do not say to you that I possess the treasuries of Allah, neither do I know the Unseen. I do not claim to be an angel, neither do I say of those who are despicable in your eyes that Allah will not grant them any good —Allah knows best what is in their hearts— for then I would indeed be a wrongdoer.’","11:32":"They said, ‘O Noah, you have disputed with us already, and you have disputed with us exceedingly. Now bring us what you threaten us with should you be truthful","11:33":"He said, ‘Allah will indeed bring it on you if He wishes, and you cannot thwart [Him]","11:34":"My exhorting will not benefit you, much as I may seek to exhort you, if Allah desires to consign you to perversity. He is your Lord, and to Him you shall be brought back.’","11:35":"Do they say, ‘He has fabricated it?’ Say, ‘Should I have fabricated it, then my guilt will be upon me, and I am absolved of your guilty conduct.’","11:36":"It was revealed to Noah: ‘None of your people will believe except those who already have faith; so do not sorrow for what they used to do","11:37":"Build the ark before Our eyes and by Our revelation, and do not plead with Me for those who are wrongdoers: they shall indeed be drowned.’","11:38":"As he was building the ark, whenever the elders of his people passed by him, they would ridicule him. He said, ‘If you ridicule us [today], we shall ridicule you [tomorrow] just as you ridicule us [now]","11:39":"Soon you will know whom a disgraceful punishment will overtake and on whom a lasting punishment will descend.’","11:40":"When Our edict came and the oven gushed [a stream of water], We said, ‘Carry in it a pair of every kind [of animal], along with your family —except those [of them] against whom the edict has already been given— and those who have faith.’ And none believed with him except a few","11:41":"He said, ‘Board it: In the Name of Allah it shall set sail and cast anchor. Indeed my Lord is all-forgiving, all-merciful.’","11:42":"And it sailed along with them amid waves [rising] like mountains. Noah called out to his son, who stood aloof, ‘O my son! ‘Board with us, and do not be with the faithless!’","11:43":"He said, ‘I shall take refuge on a mountain; it will protect me from the flood.’ He said, ‘There is none today who can protect from Allah’s edict, except someone upon whom He has mercy.’ Then the waves came between them, and he was among those who were drowned","11:44":"Then it was said, ‘O earth, swallow your water! O sky, leave off!’ The waters receded; the edict was carried out, and it settled on [Mount] Judi. Then it was said, ‘Away with the wrongdoing lot!’","11:45":"Noah called out to his Lord, and said, ‘My Lord! My son is indeed from my family. Your promise is indeed true, and You are the fairest of all judges.’","11:46":"Said He, ‘O Noah! Indeed He is not of your family. Indeed he is [personification of] unrighteous conduct. So do not ask Me [something] of which you have no knowledge. I advise you lest you should be among the ignorant.’","11:47":"He said, ‘My Lord! I seek Your protection lest I should ask You something of which I have no knowledge. If You do not forgive me and have mercy upon me I shall be among the losers.’","11:48":"It was said, ‘O Noah! Disembark in peace from Us and with [Our] blessings upon you and upon nations [to descend] from those who are with you, and nations whom We shall provide for, then a painful punishment from Us shall befall them.’","11:49":"These are accounts of the Unseen which We reveal to you. Neither you nor your people used to know them before this. So be patient. Indeed the outcome will be in favour of the Godwary","11:50":"And to ‘a€d [We sent] Hud, their brother. He said, ‘O my people! Worship Allah. You have no other god besides Him: you merely fabricate [the deities that you worship]","11:51":"‘O my people! I do not ask you any reward for it. My reward lies only with Him who originated me. Do you not apply reason","11:52":"‘O my people!

There is no living being but He holds it by its forelock. Indeed my Lord is on a straight path","11:57":"But if you turn your backs [on me], then [know that] I have communicated to you whatever I was sent to you with. My Lord will make another people succeed you, and you will not hurt Allah in the least. Indeed my Lord is watchful over all things.’","11:58":"And when Our edict came, We delivered Hud and the faithful who were with him, by a mercy from Us, and We delivered them from a harsh punishment","11:59":"Such were [the people of] ‘a€d: they impugned the signs of their Lord and disobeyed His apostles, and followed the dictates of every obdurate tyrant","11:60":"So they were pursued by a curse in this world and on the Day of Resurrection. Look! Indeed ‘a€d defied their Lord. Look! Away with ‘a€d, the people of Hud","11:61":"And to Thamud [We sent] á¹¢aliá¸¥, their brother. He said, ‘O my people! Worship Allah. You have no other god besides Him. He brought you forth from the earth and made it your habitation. So plead with Him for forgiveness, then turn to Him penitently. My Lord is indeed nearmost [and] responsive.’","11:62":"They said, ‘O á¹¢aliá¸¥! You were a source of hope to us before this. Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers have been worshiping? Indeed we have grave doubts concerning that to which you invite us.’","11:63":"He said, ‘O my people! Tell me, should I stand on a manifest proof from my Lord, and He has granted me His own mercy, who will protect me from Allah should I disobey Him? For then you will increase me in nothing but loss","11:64":"O my people! This she-camel of Allah is a sign for you. Let her graze [freely] in Allah’s land, and do not cause her any harm, for then you shall be seized by a prompt punishment.’","11:65":"But they hamstrung her, whereupon he said, ‘Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days: that is a promise not to be belied!’","11:66":"So when Our edict came, We delivered á¹¢aliá¸¥ and the faithful who were with him by a mercy from Us, and from the [punishment and] disgrace of that day. Your Lord is indeed the All-strong, the All-mighty","11:67":"The Cry seized those who were wrongdoers, and they lay lifeless prostrate in their homes","11:68":"as if they had never lived there. Look! Indeed Thamud defied their Lord. Look! Away with Thamud","11:69":"Certainly Our messengers came to Abraham with the good news, and said, ‘Peace!’ ‘Peace!’ He replied. Presently he brought [for them] a roasted calf","11:70":"But when he saw their hands not reaching for it, he took them amiss and felt a fear of them. They said, ‘Do not be afraid. We have been sent to the people of Lot.’","11:71":"His wife, standing by, laughed as We gave her the good news of [the birth of] Isaac, and of Jacob, after Isaac","11:72":"She said, ‘Oh, my! Shall I, an old woman, bear [children], and [while] this husband of mine is an old man?! That is indeed an odd thing!’","11:73":"They said, ‘Are you amazed at Allah’s dispensation? [That is] Allah’s mercy and His blessings upon you, members of the household. Indeed He is all-laudable, all-glorious.’","11:74":"So when the awe had left Abraham and the good news had reached him, he pleaded with Us concerning the people of Lot","11:75":"Abraham was indeed most forbearing, plaintive, [and] penitent","11:76":"‘O Abraham, let this matter alone! Your Lord’s edict has certainly come, and an irrevocable punishment shall overtake them.’","11:77":"When Our messengers came to Lot, he was distressed on their account and in a predicament for their sake, and he said, ‘This is a terrible day!’","11:78":"Then his people came running toward him, and they had been committing vices aforetime. He said, ‘O my people, these are my daughters: they are purer for you. Be wary of Allah and do not humiliate me with regard to my guests. Is there not a right-minded man among you?’","11:79":"They said, ‘You certainly know that we have no interest in your daughters, and indeed you know what we want.’","11:80":"He said, ‘If only I had the power to deter you, or could take refuge in a mighty support!’","11:81":"They said, ‘O Lot, we are messengers of your Lord. They will never get at you. Set out with your family in a watch of the night; and none of you shall turn round, except your wife; indeed she will be struck by what strikes them. Indeed their tryst is the dawn. Is not the dawn [already] near?’","11:82":"So when Our edict came, We made its topmost part its nethermost, and We rained on it stones of laminar shale","11:83":"marked with your Lord [for the profligate], never far from the wrongdoers","11:84":"And to Midian [We sent] Shu‘ayb, their brother. He said, ‘O my people! Worship Allah. You have no other god besides Him. Do not diminish the measure or the balance. Indeed I see that you are faring well, but I fear for you the punishment of an all-embracing day.’","11:85":"‘O my people! Observe fully the measure and the balance, with justice, and do not cheat the people of their goods, and do not act wickedly on the earth, causing corruption.’","11:86":"‘What remains of Allah’s provision is better for you, should you be faithful, and I am not a keeper over you.’","11:87":"They said, ‘O Shu‘ayb, does your worship require that we abandon what our fathers have been worshiping, or that we should not do with our wealth whatever we wish? You are indeed [a] gentle and sensible [person].’","11:88":"He said, ‘O my people! Have you considered, should I stand on a manifest proof from my Lord, who has provided me a good provision from Himself? I do not wish to oppose you by what I forbid you. I only desire to put things in order, as far as I can, and my success lies only with Allah: in Him I have put my trust, and to Him I turn penitently","11:89":"O my people, do not let your defiance toward me lead you to be visited by the like of what was visited on the people of Noah, or the people of Hud, or the people of á¹¢aliá¸¥, and the people of Lot are not distant from you","11:90":"Plead with your Lord for forgiveness, then turn to Him penitently. My Lord is indeed all-merciful, all-affectionate.’","11:91":"They said, ‘O Shu‘ayb, we do not understand much of what you say. Indeed we see you are weak amongst us, and were it not for your tribe, we would have stoned you, and you are not venerable to us.’","11:92":"He said, ‘O my people! Is my tribe more venerable in your sight than Allah, to whom you pay no regard? Indeed my Lord comprehends whatever you do","11:93":"O my people! Act according to your ability; I too am acting. Soon you will know who will be overtaken by a punishment that will disgrace him, and who is a liar. So be on the watch; I too will be watching along with you.’","11:94":"And when Our edict came, We delivered Shu‘ayb and the faithful who were with him by a mercy from Us. And the Cry seized those who were wrongdoers, whereat they lay lifeless prostrate in their homes","11:95":"as if they had never lived there. Look! Away with Midian! —just as Thamud was done away with","11:96":"Certainly We sent Moses with Our signs and a manifest authority","11:97":"to Pharaoh and his elite, but they followed Pharaoh’s dictates, and Pharaoh’s dictates were not right-minded","11:98":"On the Day of Resurrection he will lead his people and conduct them into the Fire: an evil goal for the incoming","11:99":"They were pursued by a curse in this [world], as well as on the Day of Resurrection; evil is the award conferred [upon them]","11:100":"These are from the accounts of the townships which We recount to you. Of them there are some that still stand, and some that have been mown down","11:101":"We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves. Of no avail to them were their gods whom they would invoke besides Allah, in any wise, when your Lord’s edict came, and they did not increase them in anything but ruin","11:102":"Such is the seizing of your Lord when He seizes the townships that are wrongdoing. Indeed His seizing is painful, severe","11:103":"There is indeed a sign in that for him who fears the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a day on which all mankind will be gathered, and it is a day witnessed [by all creatures]","11:104":"And We do not defer it but for a determinate term","11:105":"The day it comes, no one shall speak except by His leave. [On that day,] some of them will be wretched and [some] felicitous","11:106":"As for the wretched, they shall be in the Fire: their lot therein will be groaning and wailing","11:107":"They shall remain in it for as long as the heavens and the earth endure —except what your Lord may wish; indeed your Lord does whatever He desires","11:108":"As for the felicitous, they will be in paradise. They will remain in it for as long as the heavens and the earth endure —except what your Lord may wish— an endless bounty","11:109":"So do not be in doubt about what these worship: they worship just as their fathers worshiped before, and We shall surely pay them their full share, undiminished","11:110":"Certainly We gave Moses the Book, but differences arose about it, and were it not for a prior decree of your Lord, a decision would have been made between them; indeed they are in grave doubt concerning it","11:111":"Your Lord will indeed recompense everyone fully for their works. Indeed He is well aware of what they do","11:112":"So be steadfast, just as you have been commanded— [you] and whoever has turned [to Allah] with you— and do not overstep the bounds. Indeed He sees best what you do","11:113":"And do not incline toward the wrongdoers, lest the Fire should touch you, and you will not have any friend besides Allah, then you will not be helped","11:114":"Maintain the prayer at the two ends of the day, and during the early hours of the night. Indeed good deeds efface misdeeds. That is an admonition for the mindful","11:115":"And be patient; indeed Allah does not waste the reward of the virtuous","11:116":"Why were there not among the generations before you a remnant [of the wise] who might forbid corruption in the earth, except a few of those whom We delivered from among them? Those who were wrongdoers pursued that in which they had been granted affluence, and they were a guilty lot","11:117":"Your Lord would never destroy the townships unjustly while their inhabitants were bringing about reform","11:118":"Had your Lord wished, He would have made mankind one community; but they continue to differ","11:119":"except those on whom your Lord has mercy —and that is why He created them— and the word of your Lord has been fulfilled: ‘I will surely fill hell with jinn and humans, all together!’","11:120":"Whatever We relate to you of the accounts of the apostles are those by which We strengthen your heart, and there has come to you in this [surah] the truth and an advice and admonition for the faithful","11:121":"And say to those who do not have faith, ‘Act according to your ability; we too are acting","11:122":"And wait! We too are waiting.’","11:123":"To Allah belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth, and to Him all matters are returned. So worship Him and trust in Him. Your Lord is not oblivious of what you do","12:1":"Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the signs of the Manifest Book","12:2":"Indeed We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an so that you may apply reason","12:3":"We will recount to you the best of narratives in what We have revealed to you of this Qur’an, and indeed prior to it you were among those who are unaware [of it]","12:4":"When Joseph said to his father, ‘Father! I saw eleven planets, and the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrating themselves before me.’","12:5":"He said, ‘My son, do not recount your dream to your brothers, lest they should devise schemes against you. Satan is indeed man’s manifest enemy","12:6":"That is how your Lord will choose you, and teach you the interpretation of dreams, and complete His blessing upon you and upon the house of Jacob, just as He completed it earlier for your fathers, Abraham and Isaac. Your Lord is indeed all-knowing, all-wise.’","12:7":"In Joseph and his brothers there are certainly signs for the seekers","12:8":"When they said, ‘Surely Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than [the rest of] us, though we are a hardy group. Our father is indeed in manifest error.’","12:9":"‘Kill Joseph or cast him away into some [distant] land, so that your father’s love may be exclusively yours, and that you may become a righteous lot after that.’","12:10":"One of them said, ‘Do not kill Joseph, but throw him into the recess of some well so that some caravan may pick him up, if you are to do [anything].’","12:11":"They said, ‘Father! Why is it that you do not trust us with Joseph? We are indeed his well-wishers","12:12":"Let him go with us tomorrow so that he may eat lots of fruits and play, and we will indeed take [good] care of him.’","12:13":"He said, ‘It really upsets me that you should take him away, and I fear the wolf may eat him while you are oblivious of him.’","12:14":"They said, ‘Should the wolf eat him while we are a hardy group, then we will indeed be losers!’","12:15":"So when they took him away and conspired to put him into the recess of a well, We revealed to him, ‘[A day will come when] you will surely inform them about this affair of theirs while they are not aware [of your identity].’","12:16":"In the evening, they came weeping to their father","12:17":"They said, ‘Father! We had gone racing and left Joseph with our things, whereat the wolf ate him. But you will not believe us even if we spoke truly.’","12:18":"And they produced sham blood on his shirt. He said, ‘Rather your souls have made a matter seem decorous to you. Yet patience is graceful, and Allah is my resort against what you allege.’","12:19":"And there came a caravan, and they sent their water-drawer, who let down his bucket. ‘Good news!’ he said. ‘This is a young boy!’ So they hid him as [a piece of] merchandise, and Allah knew best what they were doing","12:20":"And they sold him for a cheap price, a few dirhams, for they set small store by him","12:21":"The man from Egypt who had bought him said to his wife, ‘Give him an honourable place [in the household]. Maybe he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son.’ Thus We established Joseph in the land and that We might teach him the interpretation of dreams. Allah has [full] command of His affairs, but most people do not know","12:22":"When he came of age, We gave him judgement and [sacred] knowledge, and thus do We reward the virtuous","12:23":"The woman in whose house he was solicited him. She closed the doors and said, ‘Come!!’ He said, ‘God forbid! Indeed He is my Lord; He has given me a good abode. Indeed the wrongdoers are not felicitous.’","12:24":"She certainly made for him; and he would have made for her [too] had he not beheld the proof of his Lord. So it was, that We might turn away from him all evil and indecency. He was indeed one of Our dedicated servants","12:25":"They raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from behind, and they ran into her husband at the door. She said, ‘What is to be the requital of him who has evil intentions for your wife except imprisonment or a painful punishment?’","12:26":"He said, ‘It was she who solicited me.’ A witness of her own household testified: ‘If his shirt is torn from the front, she tells the truth and he lies","12:27":"But if his shirt is torn from behind, then she lies and he tells the truth.’","12:28":"So when he saw that his shirt was torn from behind, he said, ‘This is [a case] of you women’s guile! Your guile is great indeed","12:29":"Joseph, let this matter alone, and you, woman, plead for forgiveness for your sin, for you have indeed been erring.’","12:30":"Some of the townswomen said, ‘The chieftain’s wife has solicited her slave boy! He has captivated her love. Indeed we see her to be in manifest error.’","12:31":"When she heard of their machinations, she sent for them and arranged a repast, and gave each of them a knife, and said [to Joseph], ‘Come out before them.’ So when they saw him, they marveled at him and cut their hands [absent-mindedly], and they said, ‘Good heavens! This is not a human being! This is but a noble angel!’","12:32":"She said, ‘He is the one on whose account you blamed me. Certainly I did solicit him, but he was continent, and if he does not do what I bid him, surely he shall be imprisoned and be among the abased.’","12:33":"He said, ‘My Lord! The prison is dearer to me than to what they invite me. If You do not turn away their schemes from me, then I will incline towards them and become one of the senseless.’","12:34":"So his Lord answered him and turned away their stratagems from him. Indeed He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing","12:35":"Then it appeared to them, after they had seen all the signs [of his innocence], that they should confine him for some time","12:36":"There entered the prison two youths along with him. One of them said, ‘I dreamt that I am pressing grapes.’ The other said, ‘I dreamt that I am carrying bread on my head from which the birds are eating.’ ‘Inform us of its interpretation,’ [they said], ‘for indeed we see you to be a virtuous man.’","12:37":"He said, ‘Before the meals you are served come to you I will inform you of its interpretation. That is among things my Lord has taught me. Indeed I renounce the creed of the people who have no faith in Allah and who [also] disbelieve in the Hereafter","12:38":"I follow the creed of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It is not for us to ascribe any partner to Allah. That is by virtue of Allah’s grace upon us and upon all mankind, but most people do not give thanks","12:39":"O my prison mates! Are different masters better, or Allah, the One, the All-paramount","12:40":"You do not worship besides Him but [mere] names that you and your fathers have coined, for which Allah has not sent down any authority. Sovereignty belongs only to Allah. He has commanded you to worship none except Him. That is the upright religion, but most people do not know","12:41":"O my prison mates! As for one of you, he will serve wine to his master, and as for the other, he will be crucified, and vultures will eat from his head. The matter about which you inquire has been decided.’","12:42":"Then he said to the one whom he knew would be delivered from among the two: ‘Mention me to your master.’ But Satan caused him to forget mentioning [it] to his master. So he remained in the prison for several years","12:43":"[One day] the king said, ‘I saw [in a dream] seven fat cows being devoured by seven lean ones, and seven green ears and [seven] others [that were] dry. O courtiers, give me your opinion about my dream, if you can interpret dreams.’","12:44":"They said, ‘[These are] confused nightmares, and we do not know the interpretation of nightmares.’","12:45":"Said the one of the two who had been delivered, remembering [Joseph] after a long time: ‘I will inform you of its interpretation; so let me go [to meet Joseph in the prison].’","12:46":"‘Joseph,’ [he said], ‘O truthful one, give us your opinion concerning seven fat cows who are eaten by seven lean ones, and seven green ears and [seven] others dry, that I may return to the people so that they may know [the truth of the matter].’","12:47":"He said, ‘You will sow for seven consecutive years. Then leave in the ear whatever [grain] you harvest, except a little that you eat","12:48":"Then after that there will come seven hard years which will eat up whatever you have set aside for them —all except a little which you preserve [for seed]","12:49":"Then after that there will come a year wherein the people will be granted relief and provided with rains therein","12:50":"The king said, ‘Bring him to me!’ When the messenger came to him, he said, ‘Go back to your master, and ask him about the affair of women who cut their hands. My Lord is indeed well aware of their stratagems.’","12:51":"The king said, ‘What was your business, women, when you solicited Joseph?’ They said, ‘Heaven be praised! We know of no evil in him.’ The prince’s wife said, ‘Now the truth has come to light! It was I who solicited him, and he is indeed telling the truth.’","12:52":"[Joseph said], [I initiated] this [inquiry], that he may know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that Allah does not further the schemes of the treacherous","12:53":"Yet I do not absolve my [own carnal] soul, for the [carnal] soul indeed prompts [men] to evil, except inasmuch as my Lord has mercy. Indeed my Lord is all-forgiving, all-merciful.’","12:54":"The king said, ‘Bring him to me, I will make him my favourite.’ Then, when he had spoken with him, he said, ‘Indeed today [onwards] you will be honoured and trustworthy with us.’","12:55":"He said, ‘Put me in charge of the country’s granaries. I am indeed fastidious [and]well-informed.’","12:56":"That is how We established Joseph in the land that he may settle in it wherever he wished. We confer Our mercy on whomever We wish, and We do not waste the reward of the virtuous","12:57":"And the reward of the Hereafter is surely better for those who have faith and are Godwary","12:58":"[After some years] the brothers of Joseph came and entered his presence. He recognized them, but they did not recognize him","12:59":"When he had furnished them with their provision, he said, ‘Bring me a brother that you have through your father. Do you not see that I give the full measure and that I am the best of hosts","12:60":"But if you do not bring him to me, then there will be no rations for you with me, and don’t [ever] come near me.’","12:61":"They said, ‘We will solicit him from his father. [That] we will surely do.’","12:62":"He said to his servants, ‘Put their money in their saddlebags. Maybe they will recognize it when they return to their folks, and maybe they will come back [again].’","12:63":"So when they returned to their father, they said, ‘Father, the measure has been withheld from us, so let our brother go with us so that we may obtain the measure, and we will indeed take [good] care of him.’","12:64":"He said, ‘Should I trust you with him just as I trusted you with his brother before? Yet Allah is the best of protectors, and He is the most merciful of merciful ones.’","12:65":"And when they opened their baggage, they found their money restored to them. They said, ‘Father, what [more] do we want?! This is our money, restored to us! We will get provisions for our family and take care of our brother, and add another camel-load of rations. These are meagre rations.’","12:66":"He said, ‘I will not let him go with you until you give me a [solemn] pledge by Allah that you will surely bring him back to me, unless you are made to perish.’ When they had given him their [solemn] pledge, he said, ‘Allah is witness over what we say.’","12:67":"And he said, ‘My sons, do not enter by one gate, but enter by separate gates, though I cannot avail you anything against Allah. Sovereignty belongs only to Allah. In Him I have put my trust; and in Him let all the trusting put their trust.’","12:68":"When they entered whence their father had bidden them, it did not avail them anything against Allah, but only fulfilled a wish in Jacob’s heart. Indeed he had the knowledge of what We had taught him, but most people do not know","12:69":"And when they entered into the presence of Joseph, he set his brother close to himself, and said, ‘Indeed I am your brother, so do not sorrow for what they used to do.’","12:70":"When he had furnished them with their provision, he put the drinking-cup into his brother’s saddlebag. Then a herald shouted: ‘O [men of the] caravan! You are indeed thieves!’","12:71":"They said, as they turned towards them, ‘What are you missing?’","12:72":"They said, ‘We miss the king’s goblet.’ ‘Whoever brings it shall have a camel-load [of grain],’ [said the steward], ‘I will guarantee that.’","12:73":"They said, ‘By Allah! You certainly know that we did not come to make trouble in this country, and we are not thieves.’","12:74":"They said, ‘What shall be its requital if you [prove to] be lying?’","12:75":"They said, ‘The requital for it shall be that he in whose saddlebag it is found shall give himself over as its requital. Thus do we requite the wrongdoers.’","12:76":"Then he began with their sacks, before [opening] his brother’s sack. Then he took it out from his brother’s sack. Thus did We devise for Joseph’s sake. He could not have held his brother under the king’s law unless Allah willed [otherwise]. We raise in rank whomever We please, and above every man of knowledge is One who knows best","12:77":"They said, ‘If he has stolen [there is no wonder]; a brother of his had stolen before.’ Thereupon Joseph kept the matter to himself and he did not disclose it to them. He said, ‘You are in a worse state! And Allah knows best what you allege.’","12:78":"They said, ‘O emir! Indeed he has a father, a very old man; so take one of us in his place. Indeed we see that you are a virtuous man.’","12:79":"He said, ‘God forbid that we should take anyone except him with whom we found our wares, for then we would indeed be wrongdoers.’","12:80":"When they had despaired of [moving] him, they withdrew to confer privately. The eldest of them said, ‘Don’t you know that your father has taken a [solemn] pledge from you by Allah, and earlier you have neglected your duty in regard to Joseph? So I will never leave this land until my father permits me, or Allah passes a judgement for me, and He is the best of judges","12:81":"Go back to your father, and say, ‘‘Father! Your son has indeed committed theft, and we testified only to what we knew, and we could not have forestalled the unseen","12:82":"Ask [the people of] the town we were in, and the caravan with which we came. We indeed speak the truth.’’ ’","12:83":"He said, ‘Rather your souls have made a matter seem decorous to you. Yet patience is graceful. Maybe Allah will bring them all [back] to me. Indeed He is the All-knowing, the All-wise.’","12:84":"And he turned away from them and said, ‘Alas for Joseph!’ His eyes had turned white with grief, and he choked with suppressed agony","12:85":"They said, ‘By Allah! You will go on remembering Joseph until you wreck your health or perish.’","12:86":"He said, ‘I complain of my anguish and grief only to Allah. I know from Allah what you do not know.’","12:87":"‘Go, my sons, and look for Joseph and his brother, and do not despair of Allah’s mercy. Indeed no one despairs of Allah’s mercy except the faithless lot.’","12:88":"Then, when they entered into his presence, they said, ‘O emir! Distress has befallen our family, and us, and we have brought [just] a meager sum. Yet grant us the full measure, and be charitable to us! Indeed Allah rewards the charitable.’","12:89":"He said, ‘Have you realized what you did to Joseph and his brother, when you were senseless?’","12:90":"They said, ‘Are you really Joseph?!’ He said, ‘I am Joseph, and this is my brother. Certainly Allah has shown us favour. Indeed if one is Godwary and patient Allah does not waste the reward of the virtuous.’","12:91":"They said, ‘By Allah, Allah has certainly preferred you over us, and we have indeed been erring.’","12:92":"He said, ‘There shall be no reproach on you today. Allah will forgive you, and He is the most merciful of the merciful","12:93":"Take this shirt of mine, and cast it upon my father’s face; he will regain his sight, and bring me all your folks.’","12:94":"As the caravan set off, their father said, ‘I sense the scent of Joseph, if you will not consider me a dotard.’","12:95":"They said, ‘By God, you persist in your inveterate error.’","12:96":"When the bearer of good news arrived, he cast it on his face, and he regained his sight. He said, ‘Did I not tell you, ‘‘I know from Allah what you do not know?’’ ’","12:97":"They said, ‘Father! Plead [with Allah] for forgiveness of our sins! We have indeed been erring.’","12:98":"He said, ‘I shall plead with my Lord to forgive you; indeed He is the All-forgiving, the All-merciful.’","12:99":"When they entered into the presence of Joseph, he set his parents close to himself, and said, ‘Welcome to Egypt, in safety, God willing!’","12:100":"And he seated his parents high upon the throne, and they fell down prostrate before him. He said, ‘Father! This is the fulfillment of my dream of long ago, which my Lord has made come true. He was certainly gracious to me when He brought me out of the prison and brought you over from the desert after that Satan had incited ill feeling between me and my brothers. Indeed my Lord is all-attentive in bringing about what He wishes. Indeed He is the All-knowing, the All-wise.’","12:101":"‘My Lord! You have granted me a share in the kingdom, and taught me the interpretation of dreams. Originator of the heavens and earth! You are my guardian in this world and the Hereafter! Let my death be in submission [to You], and unite me with the Righteous.’","12:102":"These are accounts of the Unseen which We reveal to you, and you were not with them when they conspired together and schemed","12:103":"Yet most people will not have faith, however eager you should be","12:104":"You do not ask them any reward for it: it is just a reminder for all the nations","12:105":"How many a sign there is in the heavens and the earth that they pass by while they are disregardful of it","12:106":"And most of them do not believe in Allah without ascribing partners to Him","12:107":"Do they feel secure from being overtaken by a blanket punishment from Allah, or being overtaken by the Hour, suddenly, while they are unaware","12:108":"Say, ‘This is my way. I summon to Allah with insight —I and he who follows me. Immaculate is Allah, and I am not one of the polytheists.’","12:109":"We did not send [any apostles] before you except as men to whom We revealed from among the people of the towns.

Do you not apply reason","12:110":"When the apostles lost hope and they thought that they had been told lies, Our help came to them, and We delivered whomever We wished, and Our punishment will not be averted from the guilty lot","12:111":"There is certainly a moral in their accounts for those who possess intellect.

And from what they smelt in the fire for the purpose of [making] ornaments or wares, [there arises] a similar scum. That is how Allah compares the truth and falsehood. As for the scum, it leaves as dross, and that which profits the people remains in the earth. That is how Allah draws comparisons","13:18":"For those who answer [the summons of] their Lord there shall be the best [of rewards]. But those who do not answer Him, even if they possessed all that is on the earth and as much of it besides, they would surely offer it to redeem themselves with it. For such there shall be an adverse reckoning, and their refuge shall be hell, and it is an evil resting place","13:19":"Is someone who knows that what has been sent down to you from your Lord is the truth, like someone who is blind?

They exult in the life of this world, but compared with the Hereafter the life of this world is but a [trifling] enjoyment","13:27":"The faithless say, ‘Why has not some sign been sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say, ‘Indeed Allah leads astray whomever He wishes, and guides to Himself those who turn penitently [to Him]","13:28":"—those who have faith, and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah.’ Look! The hearts find rest in Allah’s remembrance","13:29":"Those who have faith and do righteous deeds —happy are they and good is their [ultimate] destination","13:30":"Thus have We sent you to a nation before which many nations have passed away, that you may recite to them what We have revealed to you. Yet they defy the All-beneficent.

Indeed Allah does not break His promise","13:32":"Apostles were certainly derided before you. But then I gave respite to those who were faithless, then I seized them; so how was My retribution","13:33":"Is He who sustains every soul in spite of what it earns [comparable to the idols]? And yet they ascribe partners to Allah! Say, ‘Name them!’ Will you inform Him of something He does not know about on the earth, or of [what are] mere words? Rather their scheming is presented as decorous to the faithless, and they have been barred from the [right] way; and whomever Allah leads astray, has no guide","13:34":"There is a punishment for them in the life of this world, and the punishment of the Hereafter will surely be harder, and they have no defender against Allah","13:35":"A description of the paradise promised to the Godwary: streams run in it, its fruits and shade are everlasting. Such is the requital of those who are Godwary; and the requital of the faithless is the Fire","13:36":"Those whom We have given the Book rejoice in what has been sent down to you. Among the factions are those who deny a part of it. Say, ‘Indeed I have been commanded to worship Allah and not to ascribe any partner to Him.

There is a written [schedule] for every term","13:39":"Allah effaces and confirms whatever He wishes and with Him is the Mother Book","13:40":"Whether We show you a part of what We promise them, or take you away [before that], your duty is only to communicate, and it is for Us to do the reckoning","13:41":"Have they not seen how We visit the land diminishing it at its edges? Allah judges, and there is none who may repeal His judgement, and He is swift at reckoning","13:42":"Those who were before them [also] schemed; yet all devising belongs to Allah. He knows what every soul earns. Soon the faithless will know in whose favour the outcome of that abode will be","13:43":"The faithless say, ‘You have not been sent [by Allah].’ Say, ‘Allah suffices as a witness between me and you, and he who possesses the knowledge of the Book.’","14:1":"Alif, Lam, Ra.

Then Allah leads astray whomever He wishes, and He guides whomsoever He wishes, and He is the All-mighty, the All-wise","14:5":"Certainly We sent Moses with Our signs: ‘Bring your people out from darkness into light and remind them of Allah’s [holy] days. There are indeed signs in that for every patient and grateful [servant].’","14:6":"When Moses said to his people, ‘Remember Allah’s blessing upon you when He delivered you from Pharaoh’s clan who inflicted a terrible torment on you, and slaughtered your sons and spared your women, and in that there was a great test from your Lord.’","14:7":"And when your Lord proclaimed, ‘If you are grateful, I will surely enhance you [in blessing], but if you are ungrateful, My punishment is indeed severe.’","14:8":"And Moses said, ‘Should you be faithless —you and everyone on the earth, all together— indeed Allah is all-sufficient, all-laudable.’","14:9":"Has there not come to you the account of those who were before you —the people of Noah, ‘a€d and Thamud, and those who were after them, whom no one knows [well] except Allah? Their apostles brought them manifest proofs, but they did not respond to them, and said, ‘We disbelieve in what you have been sent with. Indeed we have grave doubts concerning that to which you invite us.’","14:10":"Their apostles said, ‘Is there any doubt about Allah, the originator of the heavens and the earth?! He calls you to forgive you a part of your sins, and grants you respite until a specified time.’ They said, ‘You are nothing but humans like us who desire to bar us from what our fathers used to worship. So bring us a manifest authority.’","14:11":"Their apostles said to them, ‘Indeed we are just human beings like yourselves; but Allah favours whomever of His servants that He wishes. We may not bring you an authority except by Allah’s leave, and in Allah let all the faithful put their trust","14:12":"And why should we not put our trust in Allah, seeing that He has guided us in our ways? Surely, we will put up patiently with whatever torment you may inflict upon us, and in Allah let all the trusting put their trust.’","14:13":"But the faithless said to their apostles, ‘Surely we will expel you from our land, or you should revert to our creed.’ Thereat their Lord revealed to them: ‘We will surely destroy the wrongdoers","14:14":"and surely We will settle you in the land after them. This [promise] is for someone who is awed to stand before Me and fears My threat.’","14:15":"They prayed for victory [against the infidels], and every obdurate tyrant has failed","14:16":"with hell lying ahead of him, [where] he shall be given to drink of a purulent fluid","14:17":"gulping it down, but hardly swallowing it: death will assail him from every side, but he will not die, and there is [yet] a harsh punishment ahead of him","14:18":"A parable of those who defy their Lord: their deeds are like ashes over which the wind blows hard on a tempestuous day: they have no power over anything they have earned.

If He wishes, He will take you away, and bring about a new creation","14:20":"and that is not a hard thing for Allah","14:21":"Together they will be presented before Allah.

It is the same to us whether we are restless or patient: there is no escape for us.’","14:22":"When the matter is all over, Satan will say, ‘Indeed Allah made you a promise that was true and I [too] made you a promise, but I failed you. I had no authority over you, except that I called you and you responded to me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves. I cannot respond to your distress calls, neither can you respond to my distress calls. Indeed I disavow your taking me for [Allah’s] partner aforetime. There is indeed a painful punishment for the wrongdoers.’","14:23":"Those who have faith and do righteous deeds will be admitted into gardens with streams running in them, to remain in them [forever], by the leave of their Lord.

Am I anything but a human, an apostle?!’","17:94":"Nothing kept the people from believing when guidance came to them, but their saying, ‘Has Allah sent a human as an apostle?!’","17:95":"Say, ‘Had there been angels in the earth, walking around and residing [in it like humans do], We would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as apostle.’","17:96":"Say, ‘Allah suffices as a witness between me and you. Indeed He is well aware and percipient of His servants.’","17:97":"Whomever Allah guides is rightly guided, and whomever He leads astray you will never find them any guardians besides Him. On the Day of Resurrection, We shall muster them [scrambling] on their faces, blind, dumb, and deaf. Their refuge shall be hell. Whenever it subsides, We shall intensify the blaze for them","17:98":"That is their requital because they defied Our signs and said, ‘What, when we have become bones and dust, shall we really be raised in a new creation?’","17:99":"Do they not see that Allah, who created the heavens and the earth, is able to create the like of them? He has appointed for them a term, in which there is no doubt; yet the wrongdoers are only intent on ingratitude","17:100":"Say, ‘Even if you possessed the treasuries of my Lord’s mercy, you would withhold them for the fear of being spent, and man is very niggardly.’","17:101":"Certainly We gave Moses nine manifest signs. So ask the Children of Israel. When he came to them, Pharaoh said to him, ‘O Moses, indeed I think you are bewitched.’","17:102":"He said, ‘You certainly know that no one has sent these [signs] except the Lord of the heavens and the earth as eye-openers, and I, O Pharaoh, indeed think you are doomed.’","17:103":"He desired to exterminate them from the land, so We drowned him and all those who were with him","17:104":"After him We said to the Children of Israel, ‘Take up residence in the land, and when the occasion of the other [promise] comes, We shall gather you in mixed company.’","17:105":"With the truth did We send it down, and with the truth did it descend, and We did not send you except as a bearer of good news and as a warner","17:106":"We have sent the Qur’an in [discrete] parts so that you may read it to the people a little at a time, and We have sent it down piecemeal","17:107":"Say, ‘Whether you believe in it, or do not believe in it, indeed those who were given knowledge before it when it is recited to them, fall down in prostration on their faces","17:108":"and say, ‘‘Immaculate is our Lord! Indeed Our Lord’s promise is bound to be fulfilled.’’","17:109":"Weeping, they fall down on their faces, and it increases them in humility.’","17:110":"Say, ‘Invoke ‘‘Allah’’ or invoke ‘‘the All-beneficent.’’ Whichever [of His Names] you may invoke, to Him belong the Best Names.’ Be neither loud in your prayer, nor murmur it, but follow a middle course between these","17:111":"and say, ‘All praise belongs to Allah, who has neither taken any son, nor has He any partner in sovereignty, nor has He [taken] any ally out of weakness,’ and magnify Him with a magnification [worthy of Him]","18:1":"All praise belongs to Allah, who has sent down the Book to His servant and did not let any crookedness be in it","18:2":"[a Book] upright, to warn of a severe punishment from Him, and to give good news to the faithful who do righteous deeds, that there shall be for them a good reward","18:3":"to abide in it forever","18:4":"and to warn those who say, ‘Allah has taken a son.’","18:5":"They do not have any knowledge of that, nor did their fathers. Monstrous is the utterance that comes out of their mouths, and they say nothing but a lie","18:6":"You are liable to imperil your life for their sake, if they should not believe this discourse, out of grief","18:7":"Indeed We have made whatever is on the earth an adornment for it that We may test them [to see] which of them is best in conduct","18:8":"And indeed We will turn whatever is on it into a barren plain","18:9":"Do you suppose that the Companions of the Cave and the Inscription were among Our wonderful signs","18:10":"When the youths took refuge in the Cave, they said, ‘Our Lord! Grant us a mercy from Yourself, and help us on to rectitude in our affair.’","18:11":"So We put them to sleep in the Cave for several years","18:12":"Then We aroused them that We might know which of the two groups better reckoned the period they had stayed","18:13":"We relate to you their account in truth. They were indeed youths who had faith in their Lord, and We had enhanced them in guidance","18:14":"and fortified their hearts, when they stood up and said, ‘Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never invoke any god besides Him, for then we shall certainly have said an atrocious lie","18:15":"These—our people— have taken gods besides Him. Why do they not bring any clear authority touching them? So who is a greater wrongdoer than he who fabricates a lie against Allah","18:16":"When you have dissociated yourselves from them and from what they worship except Allah, then take refuge in the Cave. Your Lord will unfold His mercy for you, and He will help you on to ease in your affair.’","18:17":"You may see the sun, when it rises, slanting toward the right of their cave, and, when it sets, cut across them towards the left, while they are in a cavern within it. That is one of Allah’s signs. Whomever Allah guides is rightly guided, and whomever He leads astray, you will never find for him any guardian or guide","18:18":"You will suppose them to be awake, although they are asleep. We turn them to the right and to the left, and their dog [lies] stretching its forelegs at the threshold. If you come upon them, you will surely turn to flee from them, and you will surely be filled with a terror of them","18:19":"So it was that We aroused them [from sleep] so that they might question one another. One of them said, ‘How long have you stayed [here]?’ They said, ‘We have stayed a day, or part of a day.’ They said, ‘Your Lord knows best how long you have stayed. Send one of you to the city with this money. Let him observe which of them has the purest food, and bring you provisions from there. Let him be attentive, and let him not make anyone aware of you","18:20":"Indeed should they prevail over you, they will [either] stone you [to death], or force you back into their creed, and then you will never be saved.’","18:21":"So it was that We let them come upon them, that they might know that Allah’s promise is true, and that there is no doubt in the Hour. As they were disputing among themselves about their matter, they said, ‘Build a building over them. Their Lord knows them best.’ Those who had the say in their matter said, ‘We will set up a place of worship over them.’","18:22":"They will say, ‘[They are] three; their dog is the fourth of them. They will say, ‘[They are] five, their dog is the sixth of them,’ taking a shot at the invisible. They will say, ‘[They are] seven, their dog is the eighth of them.’ Say, ‘My Lord knows best their number, and none knows them except a few.’ So do not dispute concerning them, except for a seeming dispute, and do not question about them any of them","18:23":"Do not say about anything, ‘I will indeed do it tomorrow,’","18:24":"without [adding], ‘if Allah wishes.’ And when you forget, remember your Lord, and say, ‘Maybe my Lord will guide me to [something] more akin to rectitude than this.’","18:25":"They remained in the Cave for three hundred years, and added nine more [to that number]","18:26":"Say, ‘Allah knows best how long they remained. To Him belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. How well does He see! How well does He hear! They have no guardian besides Him, and none shares with Him in His judgement.’","18:27":"Recite what has been revealed to you from your Lord’s Book. Nothing can change His words, and you will never find any refuge besides Him","18:28":"Content yourself with the company of those who supplicate their Lord morning and evening, desiring His Face, and do not loose sight of them, desiring the glitter of the life of this world. And Do not obey him whose heart We have made oblivious to Our remembrance, and who follows his own desires, and whose conduct is [mere] profligacy","18:29":"And say, ‘[This is] the truth from your Lord: let anyone who wishes believe it, and let anyone who wishes disbelieve it.’ Indeed We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose curtains will surround them [on all sides]. If they cry out for help, they will be helped with a water like molten copper which will scald the faces. What an evil drink, and how ill a resting place","18:30":"As for those who have faith and do righteous deeds —indeed We do not waste the reward of those who are good in deeds","18:31":"For such there will be the Gardens of Eden with streams running in them. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and wear green garments of silk and brocade, reclining therein on couches. How excellent a reward, and how good a resting place","18:32":"Draw for them the parable of two men for each of whom We had made two gardens of vines, and We had surrounded them with date palms, and placed crops between them","18:33":"Both gardens yielded their produce without stinting anything of it. And We had set a stream gushing through them","18:34":"He had abundant fruits, so he said to his companion, as he conversed with him: ‘I have more wealth than you, and am stronger with respect to numbers.’","18:35":"He entered his garden while he wronged himself. He said, ‘I do not think that this will ever perish","18:36":"and I do not think that the Hour will ever set in. And even if I am returned to my Lord I will surely find a resort better than this.’","18:37":"His companion said to him, as he conversed with him: ‘Do you disbelieve in Him who created you from dust, then from a drop of [seminal] fluid, then fashioned you as a man","18:38":"But I [say], ‘‘He is Allah, my Lord,’’ and I do not ascribe any partner to my Lord","18:39":"Why did you not say, when you entered your garden, ‘‘[This is] as Allah has wished! There is no power except by Allah!’’ If you see that I have lesser wealth than you and children","18:40":"maybe my Lord will give me [something] better than your garden, and He will unleash upon it bolts from the sky, so that it becomes a bare plain","18:41":"Or its water will sink down, so that you cannot obtain it.’","18:42":"And ruin closed in on his produce, and he began to wring his hands for what he had spent on it, as it lay fallen on its trellises. He was saying, ‘I wish I had not ascribed any partner to my Lord.’","18:43":"He had no party to help him, besides Allah, nor could he help himself","18:44":"There, all authority belongs to Allah, the Real. He is best in rewarding, and best in requiting","18:45":"Draw for them the parable of the life of this world: [It is] like the water We send down from the sky. Then the earth’s vegetation mingles with it. Then it becomes chaff, scattered by the wind. And Allah is omnipotent over all things","18:46":"Wealth and children are an adornment of the life of the world, but lasting righteous deeds are better with your Lord in reward and better in hope","18:47":"The day We shall set the mountains moving and you will see the earth in full view, We shall muster them, and We will not leave out anyone of them","18:48":"They will be presented before your Lord in ranks: ‘Certainly you have come to Us just as We created you the first time. Rather you maintained that We shall not appoint a tryst for you.’","18:49":"The Book will be set up. Then you will see the guilty apprehensive of what is in it. They will say, ‘Woe to us! What a book is this! It omits nothing, big or small, without enumerating it.’ They will find present whatever they had done, and your Lord does not wrong anyone","18:50":"When We said to the angels, ‘Prostrate before Adam,’ they prostrated, but not Iblis. He was one of the jinn, so he transgressed against his Lord’s command. Will you then take him and his offspring for guardians in My stead, though they are your enemies? How evil a substitute for the wrongdoers","18:51":"I did not make them a witness to the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor to their own creation, nor do I take those who mislead as assistants","18:52":"The day He will say, ‘Call those whom you maintained to be My partners,’ they will call them, but they will not respond to them, for We shall place an abyss between them","18:53":"The guilty will sight the Fire and know that they will fall into it, for they will find no means to circumvent it","18:54":"Certainly We have made this Qur’an interspersed with every kind of parable for mankind. But man is the most disputatious of creatures","18:55":"People do not refuse to have faith when guidance comes to them and to plead to their Lord for forgiveness, without being overtaken by the precedent of the ancients, or confronting the punishment","18:56":"We do not send the apostles except as bearers of good news and as warners, but those who are faithless dispute fallaciously to refute thereby the truth, having taken My signs and what they are warned of in derision","18:57":"Who is a greater wrongdoer than he who is reminded of the signs of his Lord, whereat he disregards them and forgets what his hands have sent ahead? Indeed We have cast veils on their hearts lest they should understand it, and a deafness into their ears; and if you invite them to guidance they will never [let themselves] be guided","18:58":"Your Lord is the All-forgiving dispenser of mercy. Were He to take them to task because of what they have committed, He would have surely hastened their punishment. But they have a tryst, [when] they will not find a refuge besides Him","18:59":"Those are the towns that We destroyed when they were wrongdoers, and We appointed a tryst for their destruction","18:60":"When Moses said to his lad, ‘I will go on [journeying] until I have reached the confluence of the two seas, or have spent a long time [travelling].’","18:61":"So when they reached the confluence between them, they forgot their fish, which found its way into the sea, sneaking away","18:62":"So when they had passed on, he said to his lad, ‘Bring us our meal. We have certainly encountered much fatigue on this journey of ours.’","18:63":"He said, ‘Did you see?! When we took shelter at the rock, indeed I forgot about the fish —and none but Satan made me forget to mention it!— and it made its way into the sea in an amazing manner!’","18:64":"He said, ‘That is what we were after!’ So they returned, retracing their footsteps","18:65":"[There] they found one of Our servants whom We had granted a mercy from Ourselves, and taught him a knowledge from Our own","18:66":"Moses said to him, ‘May I follow you for the purpose that you teach me some of the probity you have been taught?’","18:67":"He said, ‘Indeed you cannot have patience with me","18:68":"And how can you have patience about something you are not in the know of?’","18:69":"He said, ‘You will find me, God willing, to be patient, and I will not disobey you in any matter.’","18:70":"He said, ‘If you follow me, do not question me concerning anything until I [myself] make a mention of it to you.’","18:71":"So they went on. When they boarded the boat, he made a hole in it. He said, ‘Did you make a hole in it to drown its people? You have certainly done a monstrous thing!’","18:72":"He said, ‘Did I not say, indeed you cannot have patience with me?’","18:73":"He said, ‘Do not take me to task for my forgetting, and do not be hard upon me.’","18:74":"So they went on. When they encountered a boy, he slew him. He said, ‘Did you slay an innocent soul, without [his having slain] anyone? You have certainly done a dire thing!’","18:75":"He said, ‘Did I not tell you, indeed you cannot have patience with me?’","18:76":"He said, ‘If I question you about anything after this, do not keep me in your company. You have already got sufficient excuse on my part.’","18:77":"So they went on. When they came to the people of a town, they asked its people for food, but they refused to extend them any hospitality. There they found a wall which was about to collapse, so he erected it. He said, ‘Had you wished, you could have taken a wage for it.’","18:78":"He said, ‘This is where you and I shall part. I will inform you about the interpretation of that over which you could not maintain patience","18:79":"As for the boat, it belonged to some poor people who work on the sea. I wanted to make it defective, for behind them was a king seizing every ship usurpingly","18:80":"As for the boy, his parents were faithful [persons], and We feared he would overwhelm them with rebellion and unfaith","18:81":"So We desired that their Lord should give them in exchange one better than him in respect of purity and closer in mercy","18:82":"As for the wall, it belonged to two boy orphans in the city. Under it there was a treasure belonging to them. Their father had been a righteous man. So your Lord desired that they should come of age and take out their treasure —as a mercy from your Lord. I did not do that out of my own accord. This is the interpretation of that over which you could not maintain patience.’","18:83":"They question you concerning Dhul Qarnayn. Say, ‘I will relate to you an account of him.’","18:84":"Indeed We had granted him power in the land and given him the means to all things","18:85":"So he followed a means","18:86":"When he reached the place where the sun sets, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and by it he found a people. We said, ‘O Dhul Qarnayn! You may either punish them, or treat them with kindness.’","18:87":"He said, ‘As for him who is a wrongdoer, we will punish him. Then he shall be returned to his Lord and He will punish him with a dire punishment","18:88":"But as for him who has faith and acts righteously, he shall have the best reward, and we will speak to him gently of our command.’","18:89":"Then he followed a means","18:90":"When he reached the place where the sun rises, he found it rising on a people for whom We had not provided any shield against it","18:91":"So it was, and We comprehended whatever pertained to him","18:92":"Then he followed a means","18:93":"When he reached [the place] between the two barriers, he found between them a people who could hardly understand a word","18:94":"They said, ‘O Dhul Qarnayn! Indeed Gog and Magog are causing corruption in the land. Shall we pay you a tribute on condition that you build a barrier between them and us?’","18:95":"He said, ‘What my Lord has furnished me is better. Yet help me with some power, and I will make a bulwark between you and them","18:96":"Bring me pieces of iron!’ When he had levelled up between the flanks, he said, ‘Blow!’ When he had turned it into fire, he said, ‘Bring me molten copper to pour over it.’","18:97":"So they could neither scale it, nor could they make a hole in it","18:98":"He said, ‘This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord is fulfilled, He will level it; and my Lord’s promise is true.’","18:99":"That day We shall let them surge over one another, and the Trumpet will be blown, and We shall gather them all","18:100":"and that day We shall bring hell into view visibly for the faithless","18:101":"—Those whose eyes were blindfolded to My remembrance and who could not hear","18:102":"Do the faithless suppose that they have taken My servants for guardians in My stead? Indeed We have prepared hell for the hospitality of the faithless","18:103":"Say, ‘Shall we inform you about the biggest losers in regard to works","18:104":"Those whose endeavour goes awry in the life of the world, while they suppose they are doing good.’","18:105":"They are the ones who deny the signs of their Lord and the encounter with Him. So their works have failed. On the Day of Resurrection We will not set for them any weight","18:106":"That is their requital—hell— because of their faithlessness and taking My signs and My apostles in derision","18:107":"As for those who have faith and do righteous deeds they shall have the gardens of Firdaws for abode","18:108":"to remain [forever]in them, from where they will not seek to shift","18:109":"Say, ‘If the sea were ink for the words of my Lord, the sea would be spent before the words of my Lord are spent, though We brought another like it for replenishment.’","18:110":"Say, ‘I am just a human being like you. It has been revealed to me that your God is the One God. So whoever expects to encounter his Lord —let him act righteously, and not associate anyone with the worship of his Lord.’","19:1":"Kaf, Ha, Ya, ‘Ayn, á¹¢ad","19:2":"[This is] an account of your Lord’s mercy on His servant, Zechariah","19:3":"when he called out to his Lord with a secret cry","19:4":"He said, ‘My Lord! Indeed my bones have become feeble, and my head has turned white with age, yet never have I, my Lord, been disappointed in supplicating You","19:5":"Indeed I fear my kinsmen, after me, and my wife is barren. So grant me from Yourself an heir","19:6":"who may inherit from me and inherit from the House of Jacob, and make him, my Lord, pleasing [to You]!’","19:7":"‘O Zechariah! Indeed We give you the good news of a son, whose name is ‘‘John.’’ Never before have We made anyone his namesake.’","19:8":"He said, ‘My Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren, and I am already advanced in age?’","19:9":"He said, ‘So shall it be. Your Lord has said, ‘‘It is simple for Me.’’ Certainly I created you before when you were nothing.’","19:10":"He said, ‘My Lord! Appoint a sign for me.’ He said, ‘Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three complete nights.’","19:11":"So he emerged before his people from the Temple, and signaled to them that they should glorify [Allah] morning and evening","19:12":"‘O John!’ [We said,] ‘Hold on with power to the Book!’ And We gave him judgement while still a child","19:13":"and a compassion and purity from Us. He was Godwary","19:14":"and good to his parents, and was not self-willed or disobedient","19:15":"Peace be to him, the day he was born, and the day he dies, and the day he is raised alive","19:16":"And mention in the Book Mary, when she withdrew from her family to an easterly place","19:17":"Thus did she seclude herself from them, whereupon We sent to her Our Spirit and he became incarnate for her as a well-proportioned human","19:18":"She said, ‘I seek the protection of the All-beneficent from you, should you be Godwary!’","19:19":"He said, ‘I am only a messenger of your Lord that I may give you a pure son.’","19:20":"She said, ‘How shall I have a child seeing that no human being has ever touched me, nor have I been unchaste?’","19:21":"He said, ‘So shall it be. Your Lord says, ‘‘It is simple for Me.’’ And so that We may make him a sign for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is a matter [already] decided.’","19:22":"Thus she conceived him, then withdrew with him to a distant place","19:23":"The birth pangs brought her to the trunk of a date palm. She said, ‘I wish I had died before this and become a forgotten thing, beyond recall.’","19:24":"Thereupon he called her from below her [saying,] ‘Do not grieve! Your Lord has made a spring to flow at your feet","19:25":"Shake the trunk of the palm tree, freshly picked dates will drop upon you","19:26":"Eat, drink, and be comforted. Then if you see any human, say, ‘‘Indeed I have vowed a fast to the All-beneficent, so I will not speak to any human today.’’ ’","19:27":"Then carrying him she brought him to her people. They said, ‘O Mary, you have certainly come up with an odd thing","19:28":"O sister of Aaron[’s lineage]! Your father was not an evil man, nor was your mother unchaste.’","19:29":"Thereat she pointed to him. They said, ‘How can we speak to one who is yet a baby in the cradle?’","19:30":"He said, ‘Indeed I am a servant of Allah! He has given me the Book and made me a prophet","19:31":"He has made me blessed, wherever I may be, and He has enjoined me to [maintain] the prayer and to [pay] the zakat as long as I live","19:32":"and to be good to my mother, and He has not made me self-willed and wretched","19:33":"Peace is to me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I am raised alive.’","19:34":"That is Jesus, son of Mary, a Word of the Real concerning whom they are in doubt","19:35":"It is not for Allah to take a son. Immaculate is He! When He decides on a matter, He just says to it, ‘Be!’ and it is","19:36":"‘Indeed Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. This is a straight path.’","19:37":"But the factions differed among themselves. So woe to the faithless at the scene of a tremendous day","19:38":"How well they will hear and how well they will see on the day when they come to Us! But today the wrongdoers are in manifest error","19:39":"Warn them of the Day of Regret, when the matter will be decided, while they are [yet] heedless and do not have faith","19:40":"Indeed We shall inherit the earth and whoever there is on it, and to Us they shall be brought back","19:41":"And mention in the Book Abraham. Indeed he was a truthful one, a prophet","19:42":"When he said to his father, ‘Father! Why do you worship that which neither hears nor sees, and is of no avail to you in any way","19:43":"Father! Indeed a knowledge has already come to me which has not come to you. So follow me that I may guide you to a right path","19:44":"Father! Do not worship Satan. Indeed Satan is disobedient to the All-beneficent","19:45":"Father! I am indeed afraid that a punishment from the All-beneficent will befall you, and you will become Satan’s accomplice.’","19:46":"He said, ‘Abraham! Are you renouncing my gods? If you do not relinquish, I will stone you. Keep away from me for a long while.’","19:47":"He said, ‘Peace be to you! I shall plead with my Lord to forgive you. Indeed He is gracious to me","19:48":"I dissociate myself from you and whatever you invoke besides Allah. I will supplicate my Lord. Hopefully, I will not be disappointed in supplicating my Lord.’","19:49":"So when he had left them and what they worshipped besides Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and each We made a prophet","19:50":"And We gave them out of Our mercy, and conferred on them a worthy and lofty repute","19:51":"And mention in the Book Moses. Indeed he was exclusively dedicated [to Allah], and an apostle and a prophet","19:52":"We called him from the right side of the Mount and We drew him near for confidential discourse","19:53":"And We gave him out of Our mercy his brother Aaron, a prophet","19:54":"And mention in the Book Ishmael. Indeed he was true to his promise, and an apostle and a prophet","19:55":"He used to bid his family to [maintain] the prayer and to [pay] the zakat, and was pleasing to his Lord","19:56":"And mention in the Book Idra«s. Indeed he was a truthful one, a prophet","19:57":"and We raised him to a station exalted","19:58":"They are the ones whom Allah has blessed from among the prophets of Adam’s progeny, and from [the progeny of] those We carried with Noah, and from among the progeny of Abraham and Israel, and from among those We guided and chose. When the signs of the All-beneficent were recited to them, they would fall down weeping in prostration","19:59":"But they were succeeded by an evil posterity who neglected the prayer, and followed [their base] appetites. So they will soon encounter [the reward of] perversity","19:60":"barring those who repent, believe, and act righteously. Such will enter paradise, and they will not be wronged in the least","19:61":"Gardens of Eden promised by the All-beneficent to His servants, [while they were still] unseen. Indeed His promise is bound to come to pass","19:62":"Therein they will not hear vain talk, but only ‘Peace!’ And therein they will have their provision morning and evening","19:63":"This is the paradise We will give as inheritance to those of Our servants who are Godwary","19:64":"‘We do not descend except by the command of your Lord. To Him belongs whatever is before us and whatever is behind us and whatever is in between that, and your Lord is not forgetful","19:65":"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them.

Do you know anyone who could be His namesake?’","19:66":"Man says, ‘Shall I, when I have died, be brought forth alive?’","19:67":"Does not man remember that We created him before when he was nothing","19:68":"By your Lord, We will surely gather them and the devils; then We will surely bring them up around hell [scrambling] on their knees","19:69":"Then from every group We shall draw whichever of them was more defiant to the All-beneficent","19:70":"Then surely We will know best those who deserve most to enter it","19:71":"There is none of you but will come to it: a [matter that is a] decided certainty with your Lord","19:72":"Then We will deliver those who are Godwary, and leave the wrongdoers in it, fallen on their knees","19:73":"When Our manifest signs are recited to them, the faithless say to the faithful, ‘Which of the two sides is superior in station and better with respect to company?’","19:74":"How many a generation We have destroyed before them, who were superior in furnishings and appearance","19:75":"Say, ‘Whoever abides in error, the All-beneficent shall prolong his respite until they sight what they have been promised: either punishment, or the Hour.’ Then they will know whose position is worse, and whose host is weaker","19:76":"Allah enhances in guidance those who are [rightly] guided, and lasting righteous deeds are better with your Lord in reward, and better at the return [to Allah]","19:77":"Have you not regarded him who defies Our signs, and says, ‘I will surely be given wealth and children’","19:78":"Has he come to know the Unseen, or taken a promise from the All-beneficent","19:79":"No indeed! We will write down what he says, and We will prolong his punishment endlessly","19:80":"We shall take over from him what he talks about, and he will come to Us alone","19:81":"They have taken gods besides Allah that they may be a [source of] might to them","19:82":"No Indeed! Soon they will disown their worship, and they will be their opponents","19:83":"Have you not regarded that We unleash the devils upon the faithless to urge them impetuously","19:84":"So do not make haste against them; indeed We are counting for them, a counting [down]","19:85":"The day We shall gather the Godwary toward the All-beneficent, on mounts","19:86":"and drive the guilty as a thirsty herd towards hell","19:87":"No one will have the power to intercede [with Allah], except for him who has taken a covenant with the All-beneficent","19:88":"They say, ‘The All-beneficent has taken a son!’","19:89":"You have certainly advanced something hideous","19:90":"The heavens are about to be rent apart at it, the earth to split open, and the mountains to collapse into bits","19:91":"that they should ascribe a son to the All-beneficent","19:92":"It does not behoove the All-beneficent to take a son","19:93":"There is none in the heavens and the earth but he comes to the All-beneficent as a servant","19:94":"Certainly He has counted them [all] and numbered them precisely","19:95":"and each of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection","19:96":"Indeed those who have faith and do righteous deeds —the All-beneficent will endear them [to His creation]","19:97":"Indeed We have made it simple in your language so that you may give good news thereby to the Godwary and warn with it a disputatious lot","19:98":"How many a generation We have destroyed before them! Can you descry any one of them, or hear from them so much as a murmur","20:1":"á¹¬a Ha","20:2":"We did not send down to you the Qur’an that you should be miserable","20:3":"but only as an admonition to him who fears [his Lord]","20:4":"A sending down [of the Revelation] from Him who created the earth and the lofty heavens","20:5":"—the All-beneficent, settled on the Throne","20:6":"To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and whatever is between them, and whatever is under the ground","20:7":"Whether you speak loudly [or in secret tones] He indeed knows the secret and what is still more hidden","20:8":"Allah—there is no god except Him— to Him belong the Best Names","20:9":"Did the story of Moses come to you","20:10":"when he sighted a fire, and said to his family, ‘Wait! Indeed I descry a fire! Maybe I will bring you a brand from it, or find some guidance at the fire.’","20:11":"So when he came to it, he was called, ‘O Moses","20:12":"Indeed I am your Lord! So take off your sandals. You are indeed in the sacred valley of Tuwa","20:13":"I have chosen you; so listen to what is revealed","20:14":"Indeed I am Allah —there is no god except Me. So worship Me, and maintain the prayer for My remembrance","20:15":"Indeed the Hour is bound to come: I will have it hidden, so that every soul may be rewarded for what it strives for","20:16":"So do not let yourself be distracted from it by those who do not believe in it and who follow their desires, lest you should perish.’","20:17":"‘Moses, what is that in your right hand?’","20:18":"He said, ‘It is my staff. I lean upon it, and with it I beat down leaves for my sheep; and I have other uses for it.’","20:19":"He said, ‘Moses, throw it down.’","20:20":"So he threw it down, and behold, it was a snake, moving swiftly","20:21":"He said, ‘Take hold of it, and do not fear. We will restore it to its former state","20:22":"Now clasp your hand to your armpit: it will emerge white, without any fault. [This is yet] another sign","20:23":"that We may show you some of Our great signs","20:24":"Go to Pharaoh. He has indeed rebelled.’","20:25":"He said, ‘My Lord! Open my breast for me","20:26":"Make my affair easy for me","20:27":"Remove the hitch from my tongue","20:28":"[so that] they may understand my discourse","20:29":"Appoint for me a minister from my family","20:30":"Aaron, my brother","20:31":"Strengthen my back through him","20:32":"and make him my associate in my affair","20:33":"so that we may glorify You greatly","20:34":"and remember You greatly","20:35":"Indeed You see us best.’","20:36":"He said, ‘Moses, your request has been granted","20:37":"Certainly, We have done you a favour another time","20:38":"when We revealed to your mother whatever was revealed","20:39":"“Put him in the casket, and cast it into the river. Then the river will cast it on the bank, and he shall be picked up by an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his.” And I cast upon you a love from Me, and that you might be reared under My eyes","20:40":"When your sister walked up [to Pharaoh’s palace] saying, “Shall I show you someone who will take care of him?” Then We restored you to your mother, that she might be comforted and not grieve. Then you slew a soul, whereupon We delivered you from anguish, and We tried you with various ordeals. Then you stayed for several years among the people of Midian. Then you turned up as ordained, O Moses","20:41":"And I chose you for Myself","20:42":"Go ahead, you and your brother, with My signs and do not flag in My remembrance","20:43":"Let the two of you go to Pharaoh. Indeed he has rebelled","20:44":"Speak to him in a soft manner; maybe he will take admonition or fear.’","20:45":"The two of them said, ‘Our Lord! We are indeed afraid that he will forestall us or will overstep the bounds.’","20:46":"He said, ‘Do not be afraid, for I will be with the two of you, hearing and seeing [whatever happens]","20:47":"So approach him and say, ‘‘We are the apostles of your Lord. Let the Children of Israel go with us, and do not torture them! We certainly bring you a sign from your Lord, and may peace be upon him who follows guidance","20:48":"Indeed it has been revealed to us that the punishment shall befall those who deny and turn their backs [on us].’’ ’","20:49":"He said, ‘Who is your Lord, Moses?’","20:50":"He said, ‘Our Lord is He who gave everything its creation and then guided it.’","20:51":"He said, ‘What about the former generations?’","20:52":"He said, ‘Their knowledge is with my Lord, in a Book. My Lord neither makes any error nor forgets.’","20:53":"He who made the earth for you a cradle, and in it threaded for you ways, and sent down water from the sky, and with it We brought forth various kinds of vegetation","20:54":"‘Eat and pasture your cattle.’ There are indeed signs in that for those who have sense","20:55":"From it did We create you, into it shall We return you, and from it shall We bring you forth another time","20:56":"Certainly We showed him all Our signs. But he denied [them] and refused [to believe them]","20:57":"He said, ‘Have you come to us, Moses, to expel us from our land with your magic","20:58":"Yet we [too] will bring you a magic like it! So fix a tryst between us and you, which neither we shall fail nor you, at a middle place.’","20:59":"He said, ‘Your tryst shall be the Day of Adornment, and let the people be assembled in early forenoon.’","20:60":"Then Pharaoh withdrew [to consult privately], summoned up his guile, and then arrived [at the scene of the contest]","20:61":"Moses said to them, ‘Woe to you! Do not fabricate a lie against Allah, lest He should annihilate you with a punishment. Whoever fabricates lies certainly fails.’","20:62":"So they disputed their matter among themselves, and kept their confidential talks secret","20:63":"They said, ‘These two are indeed magicians who intend to expel you from your land with their magic, and to abolish your excellent tradition","20:64":"So summon up your ingenuity, then come in ranks. Today he who has the upper hand will be saved!’","20:65":"They said, ‘O Moses! Either you will throw down, or we shall be the first to throw.’","20:66":"He said, ‘Rather you throw down first.’ Behold, their ropes and staffs appeared to him by their magic to wriggle swiftly","20:67":"Then Moses felt a fear within his heart","20:68":"We said, ‘Do not be afraid. Indeed you will have the upper hand","20:69":"Throw down what is in your right hand, and it will swallow what they have conjured. What they have conjured is only a magician’s trick, and the magician does not fare well wherever he may show up.’","20:70":"Thereat the magicians fell down prostrating. They said, ‘We have believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses!’","20:71":"He said, ‘Do you profess faith in Him before I may permit you? He is indeed your chief who has taught you magic! Surely I will cut off your hands and feet from opposite sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees. So you will know which of us can inflict a punishment severer and more lasting.’","20:72":"They said, ‘We will never prefer you to the manifest proofs which have come to us and [to] Him who originated us. Decide whatever you may. You can only decide about the life of this world","20:73":"We have indeed believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our iniquities and the magic you compelled us to perform. Allah is better and more lasting.’","20:74":"Whoever comes to his Lord laden with guilt, indeed for him shall be hell where he will neither live nor die","20:75":"But whoever comes to Him with faith and he has done righteous deeds, for such shall be the highest ranks","20:76":"—the Gardens of Eden, with streams running in them, to abide in them [forever], and that is the reward of him who keeps pure","20:77":"Certainly We revealed to Moses, [saying], ‘Take My servants on a journey by night. Then strike out for them a dry path through the sea. Do not be afraid of being overtaken, and have no fear [of getting drowned]","20:78":"Then Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, whereat they were engulfed by what engulfed them of the sea","20:79":"Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide them","20:80":"O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, and We appointed with you a tryst on the right side of the Mount and We sent down to you manna and quails","20:81":"‘Eat of the good things We have provided you, but do not overstep the bounds therein, lest My wrath should descend on you. And he on whom My wrath descends certainly perishes","20:82":"Indeed I am all-forgiver toward him who repents, becomes faithful and acts righteously, and then follows guidance.’","20:83":"‘What has hurried you from your people, O Moses?’","20:84":"He said, ‘They are close upon my heels, and I hurried on to You, my Lord, that You may be pleased.’","20:85":"He said, ‘Indeed We tried your people in your absence, and the Samira« has led them astray.’","20:86":"Thereupon Moses returned to his people, indignant and grieved. He said, ‘O my people! Did not your Lord give you a true promise? Did the period [of my absence]seem too long to you? Or did you desire that your Lord’s wrath should descend on you and so you failed your tryst with me?’","20:87":"They said, ‘We did not fail our tryst with you of our own accord, but we were laden with the weight of the people’s ornaments, and we cast them [into the fire] and so did the Samira« throw.’","20:88":"Then he produced for them a calf —a [lifeless] body with a low— and they said, This is your god and the god of Moses, so he forgot","20:89":"Did they not see that it did not answer them, nor could it bring them any benefit or harm","20:90":"Aaron had certainly told them earlier, ‘O my people! You are only being tested by it. Indeed your Lord is the All-beneficent. So follow me and obey my command!’","20:91":"They had said, ‘We will keep on clinging to it until Moses returns to us.’","20:92":"He said, ‘O Aaron! What kept you, when you saw them going astray","20:93":"from following me? Did you disobey my command?’","20:94":"He said, ‘O son of my mother! Do not hold my beard or my head! I feared lest you should say, ‘‘You have caused a rift among the Children of Israel, and did not heed my word [of advice].’’ ’","20:95":"He said, ‘What is your business, O Samira«?’","20:96":"He said, ‘I saw what they did not see. I took a handful [of dust] from the messenger’s trail and threw it. That is how my soul prompted me.’","20:97":"He said, ‘Begone! It shall be your [lot] throughout life to say, ‘‘Do not touch me!’’ Indeed there is a tryst for you which you will not fail to keep! Now look at your god to whom you went on clinging. We will burn it down and then scatter it[s ashes] into the sea","20:98":"Indeed your God is Allah. There is no god except Him. He embraces all things in [His] knowledge.’","20:99":"Thus do We relate to you some accounts of what is past. Certainly We have given you a Reminder from Ourselves","20:100":"Whoever disregards it shall bear its onus on the Day of Resurrection","20:101":"remaining in it [forever]. Evil is their burden on the Day of Resurrection","20:102":"—the day the Trumpet will be blown— on that day We shall muster the guilty with blind eyes","20:103":"They will whisper to one another: ‘You have stayed only for ten [days].’","20:104":"We know best what they will say, when the best of them in conduct will say, ‘You stayed only a day!’","20:105":"They question you concerning the mountains. Say, ‘My Lord will scatter them [like dust].’","20:106":"Then He will leave it a level plain","20:107":"You will not see any crookedness or unevenness in it","20:108":"On that day they will follow a summoner in whom there will be no deviousness. The voices will be muted before the All-beneficent, and you will hear nothing but a murmur","20:109":"Intercession will not avail that day except from him whom the All-beneficent allows and approves of his word","20:110":"He knows that which is before them and that which is behind them, but they cannot comprehend Him in their knowledge","20:111":"All faces shall be humbled before the Living One, the All-sustainer, and he will fail who bears [the onus of] wrongdoing","20:112":"But whoever does righteous deeds, should he be faithful, shall neither fear any wrong nor detraction","20:113":"Thus We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an and We have paraphrased the threats in it so that they may be Godwary or it may evoke remembrance for them","20:114":"So exalted is Allah, the True Sovereign. Do not hasten with the Qur’an before its revelation is completed for you, and say, ‘My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.’","20:115":"Certainly We had enjoined Adam earlier; but he forgot, and We did not find any resoluteness in him","20:116":"When We said to the angels, ‘Prostrate before Adam,’ they prostrated, but not Iblis: he refused","20:117":"We said, ‘O Adam! This is indeed an enemy of yours and your mate’s. So do not let him expel you from paradise, or you will be miserable","20:118":"Indeed you will neither be hungry in it nor naked","20:119":"Indeed you will neither be thirsty in it, nor suffer from the sun.’","20:120":"Then Satan tempted him. He said, ‘O Adam! Shall I show you the tree of immortality, and an imperishable kingdom?’","20:121":"So they both ate of it, and their nakedness became evident to them, and they began to stitch over themselves with the leaves of paradise. Adam disobeyed his Lord, and went amiss","20:122":"Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him clemently, and guided him","20:123":"He said, ‘Get down both of you from it, all together, being enemies of one another! Yet, should any guidance come to you from Me, those who follow My guidance will not go astray, nor will they be miserable","20:124":"But whoever disregards My remembrance, his shall be a wretched life, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall raise him blind.’","20:125":"He will say, ‘My Lord! Why have You raised me blind, though I used to see?’","20:126":"He will say: ‘So it is. Our signs came to you, but you forgot them, and thus you will be forgotten today.’","20:127":"Thus do We requite him who is a profligate and does not believe in the signs of his Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is severer and more lasting","20:128":"Does it not dawn upon them how many generations We have destroyed before them, amid [the ruins of] whose dwellings they walk? There are indeed signs in this for those who have reason","20:129":"And were it not for a prior decree of your Lord and a specified time, it was inevitable","20:130":"So be patient with what they say, and celebrate the praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before the sunset, and glorify Him in watches of the night and at the day’s ends, that you may be pleased","20:131":"Do not extend your glance toward what We have provided certain groups of them as a glitter of the life of this world, so that We may test them thereby. And the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting","20:132":"And bid your family to prayer and be steadfast in its maintenance. We do not ask any provision of you. It is We who provide for you, and the outcome will be in favour of Godwariness","20:133":"They say, ‘Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord?’ Has there not come to them a manifest proof in that which is in the former scriptures","20:134":"Had We destroyed them with a punishment before it, they would have surely said, ‘Our Lord! Why did You not send us an apostle so that we might follow Your signs before we were abased and disgraced?’","20:135":"Say, ‘Each [of us] is waiting. So wait! Soon you will know who are the people of the right path, and who is guided.’","21:1":"Mankind’s reckoning has drawn near to them, yet they are disregardful in [their] obliviousness","21:2":"There does not come to them any new reminder from their Lord but they listen to it as they play around","21:3":"their hearts set on diversions. The wrongdoers secretly whisper together, [saying], ‘Is not this [man] just a human being like yourselves? Will you give in to magic with open eyes?’","21:4":"He said, ‘My Lord knows every word [spoken] in the sky and the earth, and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing.’","21:5":"Rather they said, ‘[They are] confused nightmares!’ ‘Rather he has fabricated it!’ ‘Rather he is a poet!’ ‘Let him bring us a sign, like those sent to the ancients.’","21:6":"No town that We destroyed before them believed. Will these then have faith [if they are sent signs]","21:7":"We did not send [any apostles] before you except as men, to whom We revealed. Ask the People of the Reminder if you do not know","21:8":"We did not make them bodies that did not eat food, and they were not immortal","21:9":"Then We fulfilled Our promise to them, and We delivered them and whomever We wished, and We destroyed the profligates","21:10":"Certainly We have sent down to you a Book in which there is an admonition for you. Do you not apply reason","21:11":"How many a town We have smashed that had been wrongdoing, and We brought forth another people after it","21:12":"So when they sighted Our punishment, behold, they ran away from it","21:13":"‘Do not run away! Return to the opulence you were given to enjoy and to your dwellings so that you may be questioned!’","21:14":"They said, ‘Woe to us! We have indeed been wrongdoers!’","21:15":"That remained their cry until We turned them into a mown field, stilled [like burnt ashes]","21:16":"We did not create the sky and the earth and whatever is between them for play","21:17":"Had We desired to take up some diversion We would have surely taken it up with Ourselves, were We to do [so]","21:18":"Rather We hurl the truth against falsehood, and it crushes its head, and behold, falsehood vanishes! And woe to you for what you allege [about Allah]","21:19":"To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and those who are near Him do not disdain to worship Him, nor do they become weary","21:20":"They glorify [Him] night and day, and they do not flag","21:21":"Have they taken gods from the earth who raise [the dead]","21:22":"Had there been gods in them other than Allah, they would surely have fallen apart. Clear is Allah, the Lord of the Throne, of what they allege [concerning Him]","21:23":"He is not questioned concerning what He does, but they are questioned","21:24":"Have they taken gods besides Him? Say, ‘Produce your evidence! This is a precept of those who are with me, and a precept of those [who went] before me.’ Rather most of them do not know the truth, and so they are disregardful","21:25":"We did not send any apostle before you but We revealed to him that ‘There is no god except Me; so worship Me.’","21:26":"They say, ‘The All-beneficent has taken offsprings.’ Immaculate is He! Rather they are [His] honoured servants","21:27":"They do not venture to speak ahead of Him, and they act by His command","21:28":"He knows that which is before them and that which is behind them, and they do not intercede except for someone He approves of, and they are apprehensive for the fear of Him","21:29":"Should any of them say, ‘I am a god besides Him,’ We will requite him with hell. Thus do We requite the wrongdoers","21:30":"Have the faithless not regarded that the heavens and the earth were interwoven and We unravelled them, and We made every living thing out of water? Will they not then have faith","21:31":"We set firm mountains in the earth lest it should shake with them, and We made broad ways in them so that they may be guided [to their destinations]","21:32":"We made the sky a preserved roof and yet they are disregardful of its signs","21:33":"It is He who created the night and the day, the sun and the moon, each swimming in an orbit","21:34":"We did not give immortality to any human before you. If you are fated to die, will they live on forever","21:35":"Every soul shall taste death, and We will test you with good and ill by way of test, and to Us you will be brought back","21:36":"Whenever the faithless see you they only take you in derision: ‘Is this the one who speaks ill of your gods?’ And they defy the remembrance of the All-beneficent","21:37":"Man is a creature of haste. Soon I will show you My signs. So do not ask Me to hasten","21:38":"And they say, ‘When will this promise be fulfilled, should you be truthful?’","21:39":"If only the faithless knew of the time when they will not be able to keep the Fire off their faces and their backs, nor will they be helped","21:40":"Rather it will overtake them suddenly, dumbfounding them. So neither will they be able to avert it, nor will they be granted any respite","21:41":"Apostles were certainly derided before you; but those who ridiculed them were besieged by what they had been deriding","21:42":"Say, ‘Who can guard you, day and night, from [the punishment of] the All-beneficent?’ Rather they are disregardful of their Lord’s remembrance","21:43":"Do they have gods besides Us to defend them? Neither can they help themselves, nor can they provide them with an escort against Us","21:44":"Rather We have provided for them and their fathers until they lived on for long years. Do they not see how We visit the land diminishing it at its edges? Are they the ones who will prevail","21:45":"Say, ‘I indeed warn you by the means of revelation.’ But the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned","21:46":"Should a whiff of your Lord’s punishment touch them, they will surely say, ‘Woe to us! We have indeed been wrongdoers!’","21:47":"We shall set up the scales of justice on the Day of Resurrection, and no soul will be wronged in the least. Even if it be the weight of a mustard seed We shall produce it and We suffice as reckoners","21:48":"Certainly We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion, a light and reminder for the Godwary","21:49":"Those who fear their Lord in secret, and who are apprehensive of the Hour","21:50":"This is a blessed reminder which We have sent down. Will you then deny it","21:51":"Certainly We had given Abraham his rectitude before, and We knew him","21:52":"when he said to his father and his people, ‘What are these images to which you keep on clinging?’","21:53":"They said, ‘We found our fathers worshipping them.’","21:54":"He said, ‘Certainly you and your fathers have been in manifest error.’","21:55":"They said, ‘Are you telling the truth, or are you [just] kidding?’","21:56":"He said, ‘Rather your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, who originated them, and I am a witness to this","21:57":"By Allah, I will devise a stratagem against your idols after you have gone away.’","21:58":"So he broke them into pieces, —all except the biggest of them— so that they might come back to it","21:59":"They said, ‘Whoever has done this to Our gods?! He is indeed a wrongdoer!’","21:60":"They said, ‘We heard a young man speaking ill of them. He is called ‘‘Abraham.’’ ’","21:61":"They said, ‘Bring him before the people’s eyes so that they may bear witness [against him].’","21:62":"They said, ‘Was it you who did this to our gods, O Abraham?’","21:63":"He said, ‘Rather it was this biggest of them who did it! Ask them, if they can speak.’","21:64":"Thereat they came to themselves and said [to one another], ‘Indeed it is you who are the wrongdoers!’","21:65":"Then they hung their heads. [They said], ‘You certainly know that they cannot speak.’","21:66":"He said, ‘Do you then worship, besides Allah, that which cannot cause you any benefit or harm","21:67":"Fie on you and what you worship besides Allah! Do you not apply reason?’","21:68":"They said, ‘Burn him, and help your gods, if you are to do anything!’","21:69":"We said, ‘O fire! Be cool and safe for Abraham!’","21:70":"They sought to outmaneuver him, but We made them the biggest losers","21:71":"We delivered him and Lot toward the land which We have blessed for all nations","21:72":"And We gave him Isaac, and Jacob as well for a grandson, and each of them We made righteous","21:73":"We made them imams, guiding by Our command, and We revealed to them the performance of good deeds, the maintenance of prayers, and the giving of zakat, and they used to worship Us","21:74":"We gave judgement and knowledge to Lot, and We delivered him from the town which used to commit vicious acts. Indeed they were an evil and profligate lot","21:75":"And We admitted him into Our mercy. Indeed he was one of the righteous","21:76":"And before that Noah, when he called out, We responded to him and delivered him and his family from the great agony","21:77":"And We helped him against the people who denied Our signs. They were indeed an evil lot; so We drowned them all","21:78":"And David and Solomon when they gave judgement concerning the tillage when the sheep of some people strayed into it by night, and We were witness to their judgement","21:79":"We gave its understanding to Solomon, and to each We gave judgement and knowledge. And We disposed the mountains and the birds to glorify [Us] with David, and We have been the doer [of such things]","21:80":"We taught him the making of coats of mail for you, to protect you from your [own] violence. Will you then be grateful","21:81":"And for Solomon [We disposed] the tempestuous wind which blew by his command toward the land which We have blessed, and We have knowledge of all things","21:82":"Among the devils were some who dived for him and performed tasks other than that, and We were watchful over them","21:83":"And Job, when he called out to his Lord, ‘Indeed distress has befallen me, and You are the most merciful of the merciful.’","21:84":"So We answered his prayer and removed his distress, and We gave him [back] his family along with others like them, as a mercy from Us, and an admonition for the devout","21:85":"And Ishmael, Idris, and Dhul-Kifl —each of them was among the patient","21:86":"We admitted them into Our mercy. Indeed they were among the righteous","21:87":"And the Man of the Fish, when he left in a rage, thinking that We would not put him to hardship. Then he cried out in the darkness, ‘There is no god except You! You are immaculate! I have indeed been among the wrongdoers!’","21:88":"So We answered his prayer and delivered him from the agony; and thus do We deliver the faithful","21:89":"And Zechariah, when he cried out to his Lord, ‘My Lord! Do not leave me without an heir, and You are the best of inheritors.’","21:90":"So We answered his prayer, and gave him John, and remedied his wife[’s infertility] for him. Indeed they were active in [performing] good works, and they would supplicate Us with eagerness and awe and were humble before Us","21:91":"And her who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her Our spirit, and made her and her son a sign for all the nations","21:92":"Indeed this community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord. So worship Me","21:93":"They have fragmented their religion among themselves. Everyone of them will return to Us","21:94":"Whoever does righteous deeds, should he be faithful, his endeavour shall not go unappreciated, and We will indeed write it for him","21:95":"It is forbidden for [the people of] any town that We have destroyed [to return to the world]: they shall not return","21:96":"When Gog and Magog are let loose, and they race down from every slope","21:97":"and the true promise draws near [to its fulfillment], behold, the faithless will look on with a fixed gaze: ‘Woe to us! We have certainly been oblivious of this! Rather we have been wrongdoers!’","21:98":"Indeed you and what you worship besides Allah shall be fuel for hell, and you will come to it","21:99":"—had they been gods, they would not have come to it— and they will all remain in it [forever]","21:100":"Their lot therein will be groaning, and they will not hear anything in it","21:101":"Indeed those to whom there has gone beforehand [the promise of] the best reward from Us will be kept away from it","21:102":"They will not hear even its faint sound and they will remain [forever] in what their souls desire","21:103":"The Great Terror will not upset them, and the angels will receive them [saying]: ‘This is your day which you were promised.’","21:104":"The day We shall roll up the sky, like the rolling of the scrolls for writings. We will bring it back as We began the first creation —a promise [binding] on Us. [That] indeed We will do","21:105":"Certainly We wrote in the Psalms, after the Torah: ‘Indeed My righteous servants shall inherit the earth.’","21:106":"There is indeed in this a proclamation for a devout people","21:107":"We did not send you but as a mercy to all the nations","21:108":"Say, ‘It has been revealed to me that your God is the One God. So will you submit?’","21:109":"But if they turn away, say, ‘I have proclaimed to you all alike, and I do not know whether what you have been promised is far or near","21:110":"Indeed He knows whatever is spoken aloud, and He knows whatever you conceal","21:111":"I do not know —maybe it is a trial for you and an enjoyment for a while.’","21:112":"He said, ‘My Lord! Judge with justice.’ ‘Our Lord is the All-beneficent; [He is our] resort against what you allege.’","22:1":"O mankind! Be wary of your Lord! Indeed the quake of the Hour is a terrible thing","22:2":"The day that you will see it, every suckling female will neglect what she suckled, and every pregnant female will deliver her burden, and you will see the people drunk, yet they will not be drunken, but Allah’s punishment is severe","22:3":"Among the people are those who dispute about Allah without any knowledge, and follow every froward devil","22:4":"about whom it has been decreed that should anyone take him for a friend, he will lead him astray, and conduct him toward the punishment of the Blaze","22:5":"O people! If you are in doubt about the resurrection, [consider that] We indeed created you from dust, then from a drop of [seminal] fluid, then from a clinging mass, then from a fleshy tissue, partly formed and partly unformed, so that We may manifest [Our power] to you. We establish in the wombs whatever We wish for a specified term, then We bring you forth as infants, then [We rear you] so that you may come of age. [Then] there are some of you who are taken away, and there are some of you who are relegated to the nethermost age, so that he knows nothing after [having possessed] some knowledge. And you see the earth torpid, yet when We send down water upon it, it stirs and swells, and grows every delightful kind [of plant]","22:6":"That is because Allah is the Reality and it is He who revives the dead, and He has power over all things","22:7":"and the Hour is bound to come, there is no doubt in it, and Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves","22:8":"Among the people are those who dispute concerning Allah without any knowledge or guidance, or an enlightening Book","22:9":"turning aside disdainfully to lead [others] astray from the way of Allah. For such there is disgrace in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection We will make him taste the punishment of the burning","22:10":"‘That is because of what your hands have sent ahead, and because Allah is not tyrannical to the servants.’","22:11":"And among the people are those who worship Allah on the [very] fringe: if good fortune befalls him, he is content with it; but if an ordeal visits him he makes a turnabout, to become a loser in the world and the Hereafter. That is the manifest loss","22:12":"He invokes besides Allah that which can bring him neither benefit nor harm. That is extreme error","22:13":"He invokes someone whose harm is surely likelier than his benefit. Surely an evil ally and an evil companion","22:14":"Allah will indeed admit those who have faith and do righteous deeds into gardens with streams running in them. Indeed Allah does whatever He desires","22:15":"Whoever thinks that Allah will not help him in this world and the Hereafter, let him extend a rope to the ceiling and hang himself, and see if his artifice would remove his rage","22:16":"Thus have We sent it down as manifest signs, and indeed Allah guides whomever He desires","22:17":"Indeed the faithful, the Jews, the Sabaeans, the Christians, the Magians and the polytheists —Allah will indeed judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed Allah is witness to all things","22:18":"Have you not regarded that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, the moon, and the stars, the mountains, the trees, and the animals and many of mankind? And for many the punishment has become due. Whomever Allah humiliates will find no one who may bring him honour. Indeed Allah does whatever He wishes","22:19":"These two contenders contend concerning their Lord. As for those who are faithless, cloaks of fire will be cut out for them, and boiling water will be poured over their heads","22:20":"with which their skins and entrails will be fused","22:21":"and there will be clubs of iron for them","22:22":"Whenever they desire to leave it out of anguish, they will be turned back into it [and told]: ‘Taste the punishment of the burning!’","22:23":"Indeed Allah will admit those who have faith and do righteous deeds into gardens with streams running in them, adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearl, and their dress therein will be silk","22:24":"They shall be guided to the purest speech, and guided to the path of the All-laudable","22:25":"Indeed those who are faithless and who bar from the way of Allah and the Sacred Mosque, which We have assigned for all the people, the native and the visitor being equal therein —whoever seeks to commit therein sacrilege with the intent of wrongdoing, We shall make him taste a painful punishment","22:26":"When We settled for Abraham the site of the House [saying], Do not ascribe any partners to Me, and purify My House for those who go around it, and those who stand [in it for prayer], and those who bow and prostrate","22:27":"And proclaim the á¸¥ajj to people: they shall come to you on foot and on lean camels coming from distant places","22:28":"that they may witness the benefits for them, and mention Allah’s Name during the known days over the livestock He has provided them. So eat thereof, and feed the destitute","22:29":"Then let them do away with their untidiness, and fulfill their vows, and go around the Ancient House","22:30":"That. And whoever venerates the sacraments of Allah, that is better for him with his Lord. You are permitted [animals of] grazing livestock except for what will be recited to you. So avoid the abomination of idols, and avoid false speech","22:31":"as persons having pure faith in Allah, not ascribing partners to Him. Whoever ascribes partners to Allah is as though he had fallen from a height to be devoured by vultures, or to be blown away by the wind far and wide","22:32":"That. And whoever venerates the sacraments of Allah —indeed that arises from the Godwariness of hearts","22:33":"You may benefit from them until a specified time. Then their place of sacrifice is by the Ancient House","22:34":"For every nation We have appointed a rite that they might mention Allah’s Name over the livestock He has provided them. Your God is the One God. So submit to Him. And give good news to the humble","22:35":"—those whose hearts tremble with awe when Allah is mentioned, and who are patient through whatever visits them, and who maintain the prayer and spend out of what We have provided them","22:36":"We have appointed for you the [sacrificial] camels as one of Allah’s sacraments. There is good for you in them. So mention the Name of Allah over them as they stand. And when they have fallen on their flanks, eat from them, and feed the self-contained needy and the mendicant. Thus have We disposed them for your benefit so that you may give thanks","22:37":"It is not their flesh or their blood that reaches Allah. Rather it is your Godwariness that reaches Him. Thus has He disposed them for your benefit so that you may magnify Allah for His guiding you. And give good news to the virtuous","22:38":"Allah indeed defends those who have faith. Indeed Allah does not like any ingrate traitor","22:39":"Those who are fought against are permitted [to fight] because they have been wronged, and Allah is indeed able to help them","22:40":"—Those who were expelled from their homes unjustly, only because they said, ‘Allah is our Lord.’ Had not Allah repulsed the people from one another, ruin would have befallen the monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques in which Allah’s Name is mentioned greatly. Allah will surely help those who help Him. Indeed Allah is all-strong, all-mighty","22:41":"Those who, if We granted them power in the land, maintain the prayer, give the zakat, and bid what is right and forbid what is wrong. And with Allah rests the outcome of all matters","22:42":"If they impugn you, the people of Noah have impugned before them and ‘a€d and Thamud","22:43":"[as well as] the people of Abraham and the people of Lot","22:44":"and the inhabitants of Midian, and Moses was also impugned. But I gave the faithless a respite, then I seized them and how was My rebuttal","22:45":"How many towns We have destroyed while they were wrongdoers! So they lie fallen on their trellises, their wells neglected and their lofty palaces [desolate]","22:46":"Have they not traveled over the land so that they may have hearts by which they may apply reason, or ears by which they may hear? Indeed it is not the eyes that turn blind, but the hearts turn blind —those that are in the breasts","22:47":"They ask you to hasten the punishment, though Allah shall never break His promise. Indeed a day with your Lord is like a thousand years of your reckoning","22:48":"To how many a town did I give respite while it was wrongdoing! Then I seized it, and toward Me is the destination","22:49":"Say, ‘O mankind! I am only a manifest warner to you!’","22:50":"As for those who have faith and do righteous deeds, for them is forgiveness and a noble provision","22:51":"But as for those who contend with Our signs, seeking to thwart [their purpose], they shall be the inmates of hell","22:52":"We did not send before you any apostle or prophet but that when he recited [the scripture] Satan interjected [something] in his recitation. Thereat Allah nullifies whatever Satan has interjected, [and] then Allah confirms His signs, and Allah is All-knowing, All-wise","22:53":"That He may make what Satan has thrown in a trial for those in whose hearts is a sickness and those whose hearts have hardened. Indeed the wrongdoers are steeped in extreme defiance","22:54":"That those who have been given knowledge may know that it is the truth from your Lord, and so they may have faith in it, and their hearts may be humbled before Him. Indeed Allah guides those who have faith to a straight path","22:55":"Those who are faithless persist in their doubt about it, until the Hour overtakes them suddenly, or they are overtaken by the punishment of an inauspicious day","22:56":"On that day all sovereignty will belong to Allah: He will judge between them. Then those who have faith and do righteous deeds will be in gardens of bliss","22:57":"and those who are faithless and who deny Our signs —for such there will be a humiliating punishment","22:58":"Those who migrate in the way of Allah and then are slain, or die, Allah will surely provide them with a good provision. Allah is indeed the best of providers","22:59":"He will admit them into an abode they are pleased with. Indeed Allah is all-knowing, all-forbearing","22:60":"That; and whoever retaliates with the like of what he has been made to suffer, and then is [again] aggressed against, Allah will surely help him. Indeed Allah is all-excusing, all-forgiving","22:61":"That is because Allah makes the night pass into the day and makes the day pass into the night, and because Allah is all-hearing, all-seeing","22:62":"That is because Allah is the Reality, and what they invoke besides Him is nullity, and because Allah is the All-exalted, the All-great","22:63":"Have you not regarded that Allah sends down water from the sky, whereupon the earth turns green? Indeed Allah is all-attentive, all-aware","22:64":"To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth, Indeed Allah is the All-sufficient, the All-laudable","22:65":"Have you not regarded that Allah has disposed for you[r benefit] whatever there is in the earth, and [that] the ships sail at sea by His command, and He sustains the sky lest it should fall on the earth, excepting [when it does so] by His leave? Indeed Allah is most kind and merciful to mankind","22:66":"It is He who gave you life then He makes you die, then He brings you to life.

That is indeed in a Book. That is indeed easy for Allah","22:71":"They worship besides Allah that for which He has not sent down any authority, and of which they have no knowledge. And the wrongdoers shall have no helper","22:72":"When Our manifest signs are recited to them, you perceive denial on the faces of the faithless: they would almost pounce upon those who recite Our signs to them. Say, ‘Shall I inform you about something worse than that? The Fire which Allah has promised the faithless. And it is an evil destination.’","22:73":"O mankind! Listen to a parable that is being drawn: Indeed those whom you invoke besides Allah will never create [even] a fly even if they all rallied to do so! And if a fly should take away something from them, they can not recover that from it. Feeble is the seeker and the sought","22:74":"They do not regard Allah with the regard due to Him. Indeed Allah is all-strong, all-mighty","22:75":"Allah chooses messengers from angels and from mankind. Indeed Allah is all-hearing, all-seeing","22:76":"He knows that which is before them and that which is behind them, and to Allah all matters are returned","22:77":"O you who have faith! Bow down and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord, and do good, so that you may be felicitous","22:78":"And wage jihad for the sake of Allah, a jihad which is worthy of Him. He has chosen you and has not placed for you any obstacle in the religion, the faith of your father, Abraham. He named you ‘muslims’ before, and in this, so that the Apostle may be a witness to you, and that you may be witnesses to mankind. So maintain the prayer, give the zakat, and hold fast to Allah. He is your master —an excellent master and an excellent helper","23:1":"Certainly, the faithful have attained salvation","23:2":"—those who are humble in their prayers","23:3":"who avoid vain talk","23:4":"who carry out their [duty of] zakat","23:5":"who guard their private parts","23:6":"except from their spouses or their slave women, for then they are not blameworthy","23:7":"but whoever seeks [anything] beyond that —it is they who are transgressors","23:8":"and those who keep their trusts and covenants","23:9":"and who are watchful of their prayers","23:10":"It is they who will be the inheritors","23:11":"who shall inherit paradise, and will remain in it [forever]","23:12":"Certainly We created man from an extract of clay","23:13":"Then We made him a drop of [seminal] fluid [lodged] in a secure abode","23:14":"Then We created the drop of fluid as a clinging mass. Then We created the clinging mass as a fleshy tissue. Then We created the fleshy tissue as bones. Then We clothed the bones with flesh. Then We produced him as [yet] another creature. So blessed is Allah, the best of creators","23:15":"Then indeed you die after that","23:16":"Then you will indeed be raised up on the Day of Resurrection","23:17":"Certainly We created above you the seven tiers and We have not been oblivious of creation","23:18":"We sent down water from the sky in a measured manner, and We lodged it within the ground, and We are indeed able to take it away","23:19":"Then with it We produced for you gardens of date palms and vines. There are abundant fruits in them for you, and you eat from them","23:20":"And a tree that grows on Mount Sinai which produces oil and a seasoning for those who eat","23:21":"There is indeed a moral for you in the cattle: We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies, and you have many uses in them, and you eat some of them","23:22":"and you are carried on them and on ships","23:23":"Certainly We sent Noah to his people, and he said, ‘O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other god besides Him. Will you not then be wary [of Him]?’","23:24":"But the elite of the faithless from among his people said, ‘This is just a human being like you, who seeks to dominate you. Had Allah wished, He would have sent down angels. We never heard of such a thing among our forefathers","23:25":"He is just a man possessed by madness. So bear with him for a while.’","23:26":"He said, ‘My Lord! Help me, as they impugn me.’","23:27":"So We revealed to him: ‘Build the ark before Our eyes and by Our revelation. When Our edict comes and the oven gushes [a stream of water], bring into it a pair of every kind [of animal], and your family, except those of them against whom the decree has gone beforehand, and do not plead with Me for those who are wrongdoers: they shall indeed be drowned.’","23:28":"‘When you, and those who are with you, are settled in the ark, say, ‘‘All praise belongs to Allah, who has delivered us from the wrongdoing lot.’’","23:29":"And say, ‘‘My Lord! Land me with a blessed landing, for You are the best of those who bring ashore.’’ ’","23:30":"There are indeed signs in this; and indeed We have been testing","23:31":"Then after them We brought forth another generation","23:32":"and We sent them an apostle from among themselves, saying, ‘Worship Allah! You have no other god besides Him. Will you not then be wary [of Him]?’","23:33":"Said the elite of his people, who were faithless and who denied the encounter of the Hereafter and whom We had given affluence in the life of the world: ‘This is just a human being like you: he eats what you eat, and drinks what you drink","23:34":"If you obey a human being like yourselves, you will indeed be losers","23:35":"Does he promise you that when you have died and become dust and bones you will indeed be raised [from the dead]","23:36":"Far-fetched, far-fetched is what you are promised","23:37":"There is nothing but the life of this world: we live and we die, and we shall not be resurrected","23:38":"He is just a man who has fabricated a lie against Allah, and we will not believe in him.’","23:39":"He said, ‘My Lord! Help me, as they impugn me.’","23:40":"He said, ‘In a little while they will become regretful.’","23:41":"So the Cry seized them justifiably and We turned them into a scum. So away with the wrongdoing lot","23:42":"Then after them We brought forth other generations","23:43":"No nation can advance its time nor can it defer it","23:44":"Then We sent Our apostles successively. Whenever there came to a nation its apostle, they impugned him, so We made them follow one another [to extinction] and We turned them into folktales. So away with the faithless lot","23:45":"Then We sent Moses and Aaron, his brother, with Our signs and a manifest authority","23:46":"to Pharaoh and his elites; but they acted arrogantly and they were a tyrannical lot","23:47":"They said, ‘Shall we believe two humans like ourselves, while their people are our slaves?’","23:48":"So they impugned the two of them, whereat they were among those who were destroyed","23:49":"Certainly We gave Moses the Book so that they might be guided","23:50":"and We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and sheltered them in a highland, level and watered by a stream","23:51":"O apostles! Eat of the good things and act righteously. Indeed I know best what you do","23:52":"Indeed this community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord, so be wary of Me","23:53":"But they fragmented their religion among themselves, each party exulting in what it had","23:54":"So leave them in their stupor for a while","23:55":"Do they suppose that whatever aid We provide them in regard to wealth and children [is because]","23:56":"We are eager to bring them good? Rather they are not aware","23:57":"Indeed those who are apprehensive for the fear of their Lord","23:58":"and who believe in the signs of their Lord","23:59":"and who do not ascribe partners to their Lord","23:60":"and who give whatever they give while their hearts tremble with awe that they are going to return to their Lord","23:61":"—it is they who are zealous in [performing] good works, and take the lead in them","23:62":"We task no soul except according to its capacity, and with Us is a book that speaks the truth, and they will not be wronged","23:63":"Rather their hearts are in a stupor in regard to this, and there are their other deeds besides which they perpetrate","23:64":"When We seize their affluent ones with punishment, behold, they make entreaties [to Us]","23:65":"‘Do not make entreaties today! Indeed you will not receive any help from Us","23:66":"Certainly My signs used to be recited to you, but you used to take to your heels","23:67":"being disdainful of it, talking nonsense in your nightly sessions.’","23:68":"Have they not contemplated the discourse, or has anything come to them [in it] that did not come to their forefathers","23:69":"Is it that they do not recognize their apostle, and so they deny him","23:70":"Do they say, ‘There is madness in him’? Rather he has brought them the truth, and most of them are averse to the truth","23:71":"Had the Truth followed their desires, the heavens and the earth would have surely fallen apart [along] with those who are in them. Rather We have brought them their reminder, but they are disregardful of their reminder","23:72":"Do you ask a recompense from them? Yet your Lord’s recompense is better, and He is the best of providers","23:73":"Indeed you invite them to a straight path","23:74":"and indeed those who do not believe in the Hereafter surely deviate from the path","23:75":"Should We have mercy upon them and remove their distress from them, they would surely persist, bewildered in their rebellion","23:76":"Certainly We have seized them with punishment, yet they neither humbled themselves to their Lord, nor did they entreat [Him for mercy]","23:77":"When We opened on them the door of a severe punishment, behold, they are despondent in it","23:78":"It is He who made for you hearing, eyesight, and hearts. Little do you thank","23:79":"It is He who created you on the earth, and you will be mustered toward Him","23:80":"And it is He who gives life and brings death and due to Him is the alternation of day and night. Do you not apply reason","23:81":"Rather they say just like what the ancients said","23:82":"They said, ‘What, when we are dead and become dust and bones, shall we be resurrected?’","23:83":"Certainly we and our fathers were promised this before. [But] these are nothing but myths of the ancients.’","23:84":"Say, ‘To whom does the earth belong and whoever it contains, if you know?’","23:85":"They will say, ‘To Allah.’ Say, ‘Will you not then take admonition?’","23:86":"Say, ‘Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Great Throne?’","23:87":"They will say, ‘[They belong] to Allah.’ Say, ‘Will you not then be wary [of Him]?’","23:88":"Say, ‘In whose hand is the dominion of all things, and who shelters and no shelter can be provided from Him, if you know?’","23:89":"They will say, ‘[They all belong] to Allah.’ Say, ‘Then how are you being deluded?’","23:90":"Rather We have brought them the truth, and they are indeed liars","23:91":"Allah has not taken any offspring, neither is there any god besides Him, for then each god would take away what he created, and some of them would surely rise up against others. Clear is Allah of what they allege","23:92":"The Knower of the sensible and the Unseen, He is above having any partners that they ascribe [to Him]","23:93":"Say, ‘My Lord! If You should show me what they are promised","23:94":"then do not put me, my Lord, among the wrongdoing lot.’","23:95":"We are indeed able to show you what We promise them","23:96":"Repel ill [conduct] with that which is the best.

Then he withdrew toward the shade and said, ‘My Lord! I am indeed in need of any good You may send down to me!’","28:25":"Then one of the two women approached him, walking bashfully. She said, ‘Indeed my father invites you to pay you the wages for watering [our flock] for us.’ So when he came to him and recounted the story to him, he said, ‘Do not be afraid. You have been delivered from the wrongdoing lot.’","28:26":"One of the two women said, ‘Father, hire him. Indeed the best you can hire is a powerful and trustworthy man.’","28:27":"He said, ‘Indeed I desire to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine, on condition that you hire yourself to me for eight years. And if you complete ten, that will be up to you, and I do not want to be hard on you. God willing, you will find me to be one of the righteous.’","28:28":"He said, ‘This will be [by consent] between you and me. Whichever of the two terms I complete, there shall be no reprisal against me, and Allah is witness over what we say.’","28:29":"So when Moses completed the term and set out with his family, he descried a fire on the side of the mountain. He said to his family, ‘Wait! Indeed I descry a fire! Maybe I will bring you some news from it, or a brand of fire so that you may warm yourselves.’","28:30":"When he approached it, he was called from the right bank of the valley at the blessed spot from the tree: ‘Moses! Indeed I am Allah, the Lord of all the worlds!’","28:31":"And: ‘Throw down your staff!’ And when he saw it wriggling as if it were a snake, he turned his back [to flee], without looking back. ‘Moses! Come forward, and do not be afraid. Indeed you are safe.’","28:32":"‘Insert your hand into your bosom. It will emerge white, without any fault, and keep your arms drawn in awe to your sides. These shall be two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his elite. They are indeed a transgressing lot.’","28:33":"He said, ‘My Lord! Indeed I have killed one of their men, so I fear they will kill me","28:34":"Aaron, my brother —he is more eloquent than me in speech. So send him with me as a helper to confirm me, for I fear that they will impugn me.’","28:35":"He said, ‘We will strengthen your arm by means of your brother, and invest both of you with such authority that they will not touch you. With the help of Our signs, you two, and those who follow the two of you, shall be the victors.’","28:36":"When Moses brought them Our manifest signs, they said, ‘This is nothing but concocted magic. We never heard of such a thing among our forefathers.’","28:37":"Moses said, ‘My Lord knows best who brings guidance from Him, and in whose favour the outcome of that abode will be. The wrongdoers will not be felicitous.’","28:38":"Pharaoh said, ‘O [members of the] elite! I do not know of any god that you may have other than me. Haman, light for me a fire over clay, and build me a tower so that I may take a look at Moses’ god, and indeed I consider him to be a liar!’","28:39":"He and his hosts acted arrogantly in the land unduly, and thought they would not be brought back to Us","28:40":"So We seized him and his hosts, and threw them into the sea. So observe how was the fate of the wrongdoers","28:41":"We made them leaders who invite to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not receive any help","28:42":"We made a curse pursue them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the disfigured","28:43":"Certainly We gave Moses the Book, after We had destroyed the former generations, as [a set of] eye-openers for mankind, and as guidance and mercy so that they may take admonition","28:44":"You were not on the western side when We revealed the commandments to Moses, nor were you among the witnesses","28:45":"But We brought forth other generations and time took its toll on them. And you did not dwell among the people of Midian reciting to them Our signs, but it is We who are the senders [of the apostles]","28:46":"And you were not on the side of the Mount when We called out [to Moses], but [We have sent you as] a mercy from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom there did not come any warner before you, so that they may take admonition","28:47":"And lest —should an affliction visit them because of what their hands have sent ahead— they should say, ‘Our Lord! Why did You not send us an apostle so that we might have followed Your signs and been among the faithful?’","28:48":"But when there came to them the truth from Us, they said, ‘Why has he not been given the like of what Moses was given?’ Did they not disbelieve what Moses was given before, and said, ‘Two magicians abetting each other,’ and said, ‘Indeed we disbelieve both of them’","28:49":"Say, ‘Then bring some Book from Allah better in guidance than the two so that I may follow it, should you be truthful.’","28:50":"Then if they do not respond to you[r] [summons] know that they only follow their desires. And who is more astray than him who follows his desires without any guidance from Allah? Indeed Allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot","28:51":"Certainly We have concatenated the Word for them so that they may take admonition","28:52":"Those to whom We gave the Book before it are the ones who believe in it","28:53":"and when it is recited to them, they say, ‘We believe in it. It is indeed the truth from our Lord. Indeed we were muslims [even] before it [came].’","28:54":"Those will be given their reward two times for their patience. They repel evil [conduct] with good, and spend out of what We have provided them","28:55":"and when they hear vain talk, they avoid it and say, ‘Our deeds belong to us, and your deeds belong to you. Peace be to you. We do not court the ignorant.’","28:56":"You cannot guide whomever you wish, but [it is] Allah [who] guides whomever He wishes, and He knows best those who are guided","28:57":"They say, ‘Should we follow the guidance with you, we will be dispossessed of our territory.’ Did We not establish a secure sanctuary for them where fruits of all kinds are brought as a provision from Us? But most of them do not know","28:58":"How many a town We have destroyed that transgressed in its lifestyle! There lie their dwellings, uninhabited after them except by a few, and We were the [sole] inheritors","28:59":"Your Lord would not destroy the towns until He had raised an apostle in their mother city to recite to them Our signs. We would never destroy the towns except when their people were wrongdoers","28:60":"Whatever things you have been given are only the wares of the life of this world and its glitter, and what is with Allah is better and more lasting. Will you not apply reason","28:61":"Is he to whom We have given a good promise, which he will receive, like him whom We have provided the wares of the life of this world, but who will be arraigned on the Day of Resurrection","28:62":"The day He will call out to them and say, ‘Where are My partners that you used to claim?’","28:63":"Those against whom the word had become due will say, ‘Our Lord! These are the ones whom we have perverted. We perverted them as we were perverse ourselves. We plead for non-liability before You: it was not us that they worshipped.’","28:64":"It will be said, ‘Invoke your partners!’ So they will invoke them, but they will not respond to them, and they will sight the punishment, wishing they had followed guidance","28:65":"The day He will call out to them and say, ‘What response did you give to the apostles?’","28:66":"The news that day shall be blacked out for them, so they will not question one another","28:67":"As for him who repents and develops faith and acts righteously, maybe he will be among the felicitous","28:68":"Your Lord creates whatever He wishes and chooses. They have no choice. Immaculate is Allah and exalted above [having] any partners they ascribe [to Him]","28:69":"Your Lord knows whatever their breasts conceal, and whatever they disclose","28:70":"He is Allah, there is no god except Him. All praise belongs to Him in this world and the Hereafter. All judgement belongs to Him, and to Him you will be brought back","28:71":"Say, ‘Tell me, if Allah were to make the night perpetual over you until the Day of Resurrection, what god other than Allah could bring you light? Will you not then listen?’","28:72":"Say, ‘Tell me, if Allah were to make the day perpetual over you until the Day of Resurrection, what god other than Allah could bring you night wherein you could rest? Will you not then perceive?’","28:73":"Out of His mercy He has made for you the night and the day, that you may rest therein and that you may seek from His grace and so that you may give thanks","28:74":"The day He will call out to them and say, ‘Where are My partners that you used to claim?’","28:75":"We shall draw from every nation a witness and say, ‘Produce your evidence.’ Then they will know that all reality belongs to Allah and what they used to fabricate will forsake them","28:76":"Korah indeed belonged to the people of Moses, but he bullied them. We had given him so much treasures that their keys indeed proved heavy for a band of stalwarts. When his people said to him, ‘Do not exult! Indeed Allah does not like the exultant","28:77":"By the means of what Allah has given you, seek the abode of the Hereafter, while not forgetting your share of this world. Be good [to others] just as Allah has been good to you, and do not try to cause corruption in the land. Indeed Allah does not like the agents of corruption.’","28:78":"He said, ‘I have indeed been given [all] this because of the knowledge that I have.’ Did he not know that Allah had already destroyed before him some of the generations who were more powerful than him and greater in amassing [wealth]? The guilty will not be questioned about their sins","28:79":"So he emerged before his people in his finery. Those who desired the life of the world said, ‘We wish we had like what Korah has been given! Indeed he is greatly fortunate.’","28:80":"Those who were given knowledge said, ‘Woe to you! Allah’s reward is better for someone who has faith and acts righteously, and no one will receive it except the patient.’","28:81":"So We caused the earth to swallow him and his house, and he had no party that might protect him from Allah, nor could he rescue himself","28:82":"By dawn those who longed to be in his place the day before were saying, ‘Don’t you see that Allah expands the provision for whomever He wishes of His servants, and tightens it? Had Allah not shown us favour, He might have made the earth swallow us too. Don’t you see that the faithless do not prosper.’","28:83":"This is the abode of the Hereafter which We shall grant to those who do not desire to domineer in the earth nor to cause corruption, and the outcome will be in favour of the Godwary","28:84":"Whoever brings virtue shall receive [a reward] better than it, but whoever brings vice —those who commit misdeeds shall not be requited except for what they used to do","28:85":"Indeed He who has revealed to you the Qur’an will surely restore you to the place of return. Say, ‘My Lord knows best him who brings guidance and him who is in manifest error.’","28:86":"You did not expect that the Book would be delivered to you; but it was a mercy from your Lord. So do not be ever an advocate of the faithless","28:87":"Do not ever let them bar you from Allah’s signs after they have been sent down to you. Invite to your Lord, and never be one of the polytheists","28:88":"And do not invoke another god besides Allah; there is no god except Him. Everything is to perish except His Face. All judgement belongs to Him, and to Him you will be brought back","29:1":"Alif, Lam, Ma«m","29:2":"Do the people suppose that they will be let off because they say, ‘We have faith,’ and they will not be tested","29:3":"Certainly We tested those who were before them. So Allah shall surely ascertain those who are truthful, and He shall surely ascertain the liars","29:4":"Do those who commit misdeeds suppose that they can outmaneuver Us? Evil is the judgement that they make","29:5":"Whoever expects to encounter Allah [should know that] Allah’s [appointed] time will indeed come, and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing","29:6":"Whoever strives, strives only for his own sake. Indeed Allah has no need of the creatures","29:7":"As for those who have faith and do righteous deeds, We will absolve them of their misdeeds and We will surely reward them by the best of what they used to do","29:8":"We have enjoined man to be good to his parents. But if they urge you to ascribe to Me as partner that of which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them. To Me will be your return, whereat I will inform you concerning that which you used to do","29:9":"Those who have faith and do righteous deeds, We will surely admit them among the righteous","29:10":"Among the people there are those who say, ‘We have faith in Allah,’ but if such a one is tormented in Allah’s cause, he takes persecution by the people for Allah’s punishment. Yet if there comes any help from your Lord, they will say for sure, ‘We were indeed with you.’ Does not Allah know best what is in the breasts of the creatures","29:11":"Allah shall surely ascertain those who have faith, and He shall surely ascertain the hypocrites","29:12":"The faithless say to the faithful, ‘Follow our way and we will bear [responsibility for] your iniquities.’ They will not bear anything of their iniquities. They are indeed liars","29:13":"But surely they will carry their own burdens and other burdens along with their own burdens, and they will surely be questioned on the Day of Resurrection concerning that which they used to fabricate","29:14":"Certainly We sent Noah to his people, and he remained with them for a thousand-less-fifty years. Then the flood overtook them while they were wrongdoers","29:15":"Then We delivered him and the occupants of the Ark, and made it a sign for all the nations","29:16":"And Abraham, when he said to his people, ‘Worship Allah and be wary of Him. That is better for you, should you know","29:17":"In fact, instead of Allah you worship idols, and you invent a lie. Indeed those whom you worship besides Allah have no control over your provision. So seek all [your] provision from Allah, and worship Him and thank Him, and to Him you shall be brought back.’","29:18":"And if you impugn [the Apostle’s teaching], then [other] nations have impugned [likewise] before you, and the Apostle’s duty is only to communicate in clear terms","29:19":"Have they not regarded how Allah originates the creation? Then He will bring it back. That is indeed easy for Allah","29:20":"Say, ‘Travel over the land and then observe how He has originated the creation.’ Then Allah shall bring about the genesis of the Hereafter. Indeed Allah has power over all things","29:21":"He will punish whomever He wishes and have mercy on whomever He wishes, and to Him you will be returned","29:22":"You cannot thwart Him on the earth or in the sky, nor do you have besides Allah any guardian or any helper","29:23":"Those who deny the signs of Allah and the encounter with Him, they have despaired of My mercy, and for such there is a painful punishment","29:24":"But the only answer of his people was that they said, ‘Kill him, or burn him.’ Then Allah delivered him from the fire. There are indeed signs in that for a people who have faith","29:25":"He said, ‘You have taken idols [for worship] besides Allah for the sake of [mutual] affection amongst yourselves in the life of the world. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will disown one another and curse one another, and the Fire will be your abode, and you will not have any helpers.’","29:26":"Thereupon Lot believed in him, and he said, ‘Indeed I am migrating toward my Lord. Indeed He is the All-mighty, the All-wise.’","29:27":"And We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and We ordained among his descendants prophethood and the Book, and We gave him his reward in the world, and in the Hereafter he will indeed be among the Righteous","29:28":"And Lot, when he said to his people, ‘You indeed commit an indecency none in the world has ever committed before you","29:29":"What! Do you come to men, and cut off the way, and commit outrages in your gatherings?’ But the only answer of his people was that they said, ‘Bring us Allah’s punishment should you be truthful.’","29:30":"He said, ‘My Lord! Help me against this corruptive lot.’","29:31":"And when Our messengers came to Abraham with the good news, they said, ‘We are indeed going to destroy the people of this town. Its people are indeed wrongdoers.’","29:32":"He said, ‘Lot is indeed in it.’ They said, ‘We know better those who are in it. We will surely deliver him and his family, except his wife: she shall be one of those who remain behind.’","29:33":"And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was distressed on their account and in a predicament for their sake. But they said, ‘Do not be afraid, nor grieve! We shall deliver you and your family, except your wife: she will be one of those who remain behind","29:34":"We are indeed going to bring down upon the people of this town a punishment from the sky because of the transgressions they used to commit.’","29:35":"Certainly We have left of it a manifest sign for a people who apply reason","29:36":"And to Midian We sent Shu‘ayb, their brother. He said, ‘O my people! Worship Allah, and expect [to encounter] the Last Day, and do not act wickedly on the earth causing corruption.’","29:37":"But they impugned him, whereupon the earthquake seized them, and they lay lifeless prostrate in their homes","29:38":"And ‘a€d and Thamud, [whose fate] is evident to you from their habitations. Satan made their deeds seem decorous to them, thus he barred them from the way [of Allah], though they used to be perceptive","29:39":"And Korah, Pharaoh, and Haman. Certainly Moses brought them manifest proofs, but they acted arrogantly in the land; though they could not outmaneuver [Allah]","29:40":"So We seized each [of them] for his sin: among them were those upon whom We unleashed a rain of stones, and among them were those who were seized by the Cry, and among them were those whom We caused the earth to swallow, and among them were those whom We drowned. It was not Allah who wronged them, but it was they who used to wrong themselves","29:41":"The parable of those who take guardians instead of Allah is that of the spider that takes a home, and indeed the frailest of homes is the home of a spider, had they known","29:42":"Allah indeed knows whatever thing they invoke besides Him, and He is the All-mighty, the All-wise","29:43":"And We draw these parables for mankind; but no one grasps them except those who have knowledge","29:44":"Allah created the heavens and the earth with reason. There is indeed a sign in that for the faithful","29:45":"Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book, and maintain the prayer. Indeed the prayer prevents indecencies and wrongs, and the remembrance of Allah is surely greater. And Allah knows whatever [deeds] you do","29:46":"Do not dispute with the People of the Book except in a manner which is best, barring such of them as are wrongdoers, and say, ‘We believe in that which has been sent down to us and has been sent down to you; our God and your God is one [and the same], and to Him do we submit.’","29:47":"Thus have We sent down the Book to you; and those to whom We have given the Book believe in it, and of these there are some who believe in it, and none contests Our signs except the faithless","29:48":"You did not use to recite any scripture before it, nor did you write it with your right hand, for then the impugners would have been skeptical","29:49":"Rather it is [present as] manifest signs in the breasts of those who have been given knowledge, and none contests Our signs except wrongdoers","29:50":"They say, ‘Why has not some sign been sent down to him from his Lord?’ Say, ‘The signs are only with Allah, and I am only a manifest warner.’","29:51":"Does it not suffice them that We have sent down to you the Book which is recited to them? There is indeed a mercy and admonition in that for a people who have faith","29:52":"Say, ‘Allah suffices as a witness between me and you: He knows whatever there is in the heavens and the earth. Those who put faith in falsehood and defy Allah, —it is they who are the losers.’","29:53":"They ask you to hasten the punishment. Yet were it not for a specified time, the punishment would have surely overtaken them. Surely it will overtake them suddenly while they are unaware","29:54":"They ask you to hasten the punishment, and indeed hell will besiege the faithless","29:55":"on the day when the punishment envelopes them, from above them and from under their feet, and He will say, ‘Taste what you used to do!’","29:56":"O My servants who have faith! My earth is indeed vast. So worship [only] Me","29:57":"Every soul shall taste death. Then you shall be brought back to Us","29:58":"Those who have faith and do righteous deeds, We will surely settle them in lofty abodes of paradise with streams running in them, to remain in them [forever]. How excellent is the reward of the workers","29:59":"—Those who are patient and who put their trust in their Lord","29:60":"How many an animal there is that does not carry its own provision. Allah provides for it, and for you, and He is the All-hearing, the All-knowing","29:61":"If you ask them, ‘Who created the heavens and the earth, and disposed the sun and the moon?’ They will surely say, ‘Allah.’ Then where do they stray","29:62":"Allah expands the provision for whomever He wishes of His servants, and tightens it for him. Indeed Allah has knowledge of all things","29:63":"And if you ask them, ‘Who sends down water from the sky, with which He revives the earth after its death?’ They will surely say, ‘Allah.’ Say, ‘All praise belongs to Allah!’ But most of them do not apply reason","29:64":"The life of this world is nothing but diversion and play, but the abode of the Hereafter is indeed Life, had they known","29:65":"When they board the ship, they invoke Allah putting exclusive faith in Him, but when He delivers them to land, behold, they ascribe partners [to Him]","29:66":"being ungrateful for what We have given them! So let them enjoy. Soon they will know","29:67":"Have they not seen that We have appointed a safe sanctuary, while the people are despoiled all around them? Would they then believe in falsehood and be ungrateful toward the blessing of Allah","29:68":"Who is a greater wrongdoer than him who fabricates a lie against Allah, or denies the truth when it comes to him? Is not the [final] abode of the faithless in hell","29:69":"As for those who strive in Us, We shall surely guide them in Our ways, and Allah is indeed with the virtuous","30:1":"Alif, Lam, Ma«m","30:2":"Byzantium has been vanquished","30:3":"in a nearby territory, but following their defeat they will be victors","30:4":"in a few years. All command belongs to Allah, before and after, and on that day the faithful will rejoice","30:5":"at Allah’s help. He helps whomever He wishes, and He is the All-mighty, the All-merciful","30:6":"[This is] a promise of Allah: Allah does not break His promise, but most people do not know","30:7":"They know just an outward aspect of the life of the world, but they are oblivious of the Hereafter","30:8":"Have they not reflected in their own souls? Allah did not create the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them except with reason and for a specified term. Indeed many of the people disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord","30:9":"Have they not traveled in the land so that they may observe how was the fate of those who were before them? They were more powerful than them, and they plowed the earth and developed it more than they have developed it. Their apostles brought them manifest proofs. So it was not Allah who wronged them, but it was they who used to wrong themselves","30:10":"Then the fate of those who committed misdeeds was that they denied the signs of Allah and they used to deride them","30:11":"Allah originates the creation, then He will bring it back, then you will be brought back to Him","30:12":"And when the Hour sets in, the guilty will despair","30:13":"None of those whom they ascribed as partners [to Allah] will intercede for them, and they will disavow their partners","30:14":"The day the Hour sets in, they will be divided on that day","30:15":"As for those who have faith and do righteous deeds, they shall be in a garden, rejoicing","30:16":"But as for those who were faithless and denied Our signs and the encounter of the Hereafter, they will be brought to the punishment","30:17":"So glorify Allah when you enter evening and when you rise at dawn","30:18":"To Him belongs all praise in the heavens and the earth, at nightfall and when you enter noontime","30:19":"He brings forth the living from the dead, and brings forth the dead from the living, and revives the earth after its death. Likewise you [too] shall be raised [from the dead]","30:20":"Of His signs is that He created you from dust, then, behold, you are humans scattering [all over]","30:21":"And of His signs is that He created for you mates from your own selves that you may take comfort in them, and He ordained affection and mercy between you. There are indeed signs in that for a people who reflect","30:22":"Among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of your languages and colours. There are indeed signs in that for those who know","30:23":"And of His signs is your sleep by night and day, and your pursuit of His grace. There are indeed signs in that for a people who listen","30:24":"And of His signs is that He shows you the lightning, arousing fear and hope, and He sends down water from the sky, and with it revives the earth after its death. There are indeed signs in that for a people who apply reason","30:25":"And of His signs is that the sky and the earth stand by His command, and then, when He calls you forth from the earth, behold, you will come forth","30:26":"To Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth. All are obedient to Him","30:27":"It is He who originates the creation, and then He will bring it back —and that is more simple for Him. His is the loftiest description in the heavens and the earth.

Thus do We elaborate the signs for a people who apply reason","30:29":"Rather the wrongdoers follow their own desires without any knowledge. So who will guide those whom Allah has led astray? They will have no helpers","30:30":"So set your heart on the religion as a people of pure faith, the origination of Allah according to which He originated mankind (There is no altering Allah’s creation; that is the upright religion, but most people do not know)","30:31":"—turning to Him in penitence, and be wary of Him, and maintain the prayer, and do not be among the polytheists","30:32":"—of those who split up their religion and became sects: each faction exulting in what it possessed","30:33":"When distress befalls people, they supplicate their Lord, turning to Him in penitence.

But then Allah seized them for their sins, and they had no defender against Allah[’s punishment]","40:22":"That was because their apostles used to bring them manifest proofs, but they defied [them]. So Allah seized them. Indeed He is all-strong, severe in retribution","40:23":"Certainly We sent Moses with Our signs and a manifest authority","40:24":"to Pharaoh, Haman and Korah, but they said, ‘A magician, a mendacious liar.’","40:25":"So when he brought them the truth from Us, they said, ‘Kill the sons of the faithful who are with him, and spare their women.’ But the stratagems of the faithless only go awry","40:26":"And Pharaoh said, ‘Let me slay Moses, and let him invoke his Lord. Indeed I fear that he will change your religion, or bring forth corruption in the land.’","40:27":"Moses said, ‘Indeed I seek the protection of my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.’","40:28":"Said a man of faith from Pharaoh’s clan, who concealed his faith, ‘Will you kill a man for saying, ‘‘My Lord is Allah,’’ while he has already brought you manifest proofs from your Lord? Should he be lying, his falsehood will be to his own detriment; but if he is truthful, there shall visit you some of what he promises you. Indeed Allah does not guide someone who is a profligate, a liar","40:29":"O my people! Today sovereignty belongs to you, and you are dominant in the land. But who will save us from Allah’s punishment should it overtake us?’ Pharaoh said, ‘I just point out to you what I see [to be advisable for you], and I guide you only to the way of rectitude.’","40:30":"And he who had faith said, ‘O my people! Indeed I fear for you [a day] like the day of the [heathen] factions","40:31":"like the case of the people of Noah, of ‘a€d and Thamud, and those who were after them, and Allah does not desire any wrong for [His] servants","40:32":"O my people! Indeed I fear for you a day of mutual distress calls","40:33":"a day when you will turn back [to flee], not having anyone to protect you from Allah, and whomever Allah leads astray has no guide","40:34":"Certainly Joseph brought you manifest proofs earlier, but you continued to remain in doubt concerning what he had brought you. When he died, you said, ‘‘Allah will never send any apostle after him.’’ That is how Allah leads astray those who are profligate, skeptical","40:35":"Those who dispute the signs of Allah without any authority that may have come to them —[that is] greatly outrageous to Allah and to those who have faith. That is how Allah seals the heart of every arrogant tyrant.’","40:36":"And Pharaoh said, ‘O Haman! Build me a tower so that I may reach the routes","40:37":"—the routes of the heavens— and take a look at the God of Moses, and indeed I consider him a liar.’ To Pharaoh was thus presented as decorous the evil of his conduct, and he was kept from the way [of Allah], and Pharaoh’s stratagems only led him into ruin","40:38":"And he who had faith said, ‘O my people! Follow me, I will guide you to the way of rectitude","40:39":"O my people! This life of the world is only a [passing] enjoyment, and indeed the Hereafter is the abiding home","40:40":"Whoever commits a misdeed shall not be requited except with its like, but whoever acts righteously, whether male or female, should he be faithful —such shall enter paradise, provided therein without any reckoning","40:41":"O my people! [Think,] what makes me invite you to deliverance while you invite me toward the Fire","40:42":"You invite me to defy Allah and to ascribe to Him partners of which I have no knowledge, while I call you to the All-mighty, the All-forgiver","40:43":"Undoubtedly, that to which you invite me has no invitation in the world nor in the Hereafter, and indeed our return will be to Allah, and indeed it is the profligates who will be inmates of the Fire","40:44":"Soon you will remember what I tell you, and I entrust my affair to Allah. Indeed Allah sees best the servants.’","40:45":"Then Allah saved him from their evil schemes, while a terrible punishment besieged Pharaoh’s clan","40:46":"the Fire, to which they are exposed morning and evening. And on the day when the Hour sets in Pharaoh’s clan will enter the severest punishment","40:47":"When they argue in the Fire, the weak will say to those who were arrogant, ‘Indeed we used to follow you; so will you avail us against any portion of the Fire?’","40:48":"Those who were arrogant will say, ‘Indeed we are all [together] in it. Indeed Allah has judged between [His] servants.’","40:49":"Those in the Fire will say to the keepers of hell, ‘Supplicate your Lord to lighten for us [at least] a day’s punishment.’","40:50":"They will say, ‘Did not your apostles use to bring you manifest proofs?’ They will say, ‘Yes.’ They will say, ‘Then supplicate [Him] yourselves.’ But the supplications of the faithless only go awry","40:51":"Indeed We shall help Our apostles and those who have faith in the life of the world and on the day when the witnesses rise up","40:52":"—the day when the excuses of the wrongdoers will not benefit them, and the curse will lie on them, and for them will be the ills of the [ultimate] abode","40:53":"Certainly We gave Moses the guidance and We made the Children of Israel heirs to the Book","40:54":"as a guidance and an admonition for those who possess intellect","40:55":"So be patient! Allah’s promise is indeed true. And plead for [Allah’s] forgiveness for your sin, and celebrate the praise of your Lord morning and evening","40:56":"Indeed those who dispute the signs of Allah without any authority that may have come to them —there is only vanity in their breasts, which they will never satisfy. So seek the protection of Allah; indeed He is the All-hearing, the All-seeing","40:57":"Surely the creation of the heavens and the earth is more prodigious than the creation of mankind, but most people do not know","40:58":"The blind one and the seer are not equal, neither are those who have faith and do righteous deeds and the evildoing. Little is the admonition that you take","40:59":"Indeed the Hour is bound to come; there is no doubt in it. But most people do not believe","40:60":"Your Lord has said, ‘Call Me, and I will hear you!’ Indeed those who are disdainful of My worship will enter hell in utter humility","40:61":"It is Allah who made the night for you, that you may rest in it, and the day to provide visibility. Indeed Allah is gracious to mankind, but most people do not give thanks","40:62":"That is Allah, your Lord, the creator of all things, there is no god except Him. Then where do you stray","40:63":"Thus are made to stray those who are used to impugning the signs of Allah","40:64":"It is Allah who made the earth an abode for you, and the sky a canopy, and He formed you and perfected your forms, and provided you with all the good things. That is Allah, your Lord! Blessed is Allah, Lord of all the worlds","40:65":"He is the Living One, there is no god except Him. So supplicate Him, putting exclusive faith in Him. All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all the worlds","40:66":"Say, ‘I have been forbidden to worship those whom you invoke besides Allah, since there have come to me manifest proofs from my Lord, and I have been commanded to submit to the Lord of all the worlds","40:67":"It is He who created you from dust, then from a drop of [seminal] fluid, then from a clinging mass, then He brings you forth as infants, then [He nourishes you] so that you may come of age, then that you may become aged —though there are some of you who die earlier— and that you may complete a specified term, and so that you may apply reason","40:68":"It is He who gives life and brings death. So when He decides on a matter, He just says to it, ‘Be!’ and it is","40:69":"Have you not regarded those who dispute the signs of Allah, where they are being led away [from Allah’s way]","40:70":"—Those who deny the Book and what we have sent with Our apostles. Soon they will know","40:71":"when, [with] iron collars around their necks and chains, they are dragged","40:72":"into scalding waters and then set aflame in the Fire","40:73":"Then they will be told, ‘Where are those you used to take as partners","40:74":"besides Allah?’ They will say, ‘They have forsaken us. Rather, we did not invoke anything before.’ That is how Allah leads astray the faithless","40:75":"‘That is because you used to exult unduly on the earth and because you used to walk exultantly.’","40:76":"Enter the gates of hell, to remain in it [forever].’ Evil is the [final] abode of the arrogant","40:77":"So be patient! Allah’s promise is indeed true. Whether We show you a part of what We promise them, or take you away [before that], [in any case] they will be brought back to Us","40:78":"Certainly We have sent apostles before you. Of them are those We have recounted to you, and of them are those We have not recounted to you. An apostle may not bring any sign except by Allah’s permission. Hence when Allah’s edict comes, judgment is made with justice, and it is thence that the falsifiers become losers","40:79":"It is Allah who created the cattle for you that you may ride some of them, and some of them you eat","40:80":"and there are [numerous] uses in them for you, and that over them you may satisfy any need that is in your breasts, and you are carried on them and on ships","40:81":"He shows you His signs. So which of the signs of Allah do you deny","40:82":"Have they not travelled over the land so that they may observe how was the fate of those who were before them? They were more numerous than them and were greater [than them] in power and with respect to the effects [they left] in the land. But what they used to earn did not avail them","40:83":"When their apostles brought them manifest proofs, they exulted in the knowledge they possessed, and they were besieged by what they used to deride","40:84":"Then, when they sighted Our punishment, they said, ‘We believe in Allah alone, and disavow what we used to take as His partners.’","40:85":"But their faith was of no benefit to them when they sighted Our punishment —Allah’s precedent which has passed among His servants, and it is thence that the faithless will be losers","41:1":"á¸¤a, Ma«m","41:2":"A [gradually] sent down [revelation] from the All-beneficent, the All-merciful","41:3":"[this is] a Book whose signs have been elaborated, an Arabic Qur’an, for a people who have knowledge","41:4":"a bearer of good news and a warner.

That is the Lord of all the worlds!’","41:10":"He set in it firm mountains [rising] above it, and blessed it and ordained therein its [various] means of sustenance in four days, alike for all the seekers [of the means of sustenance]","41:11":"Then He turned to the heaven, and it was smoke, and He said to it and to the earth, ‘Come! Willingly or unwillingly!’ They said, ‘We come heartily.’","41:12":"Then He set them up as seven heavens in two days, and revealed in each heaven its ordinance. We have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps, and guarded them. That is the ordaining of the All-mighty, the All-knowing","41:13":"But if they turn away, say, ‘I warn you of a thunderbolt, like the thunderbolt of ‘a€d and Thamud.’","41:14":"When the apostles came to them, before them and in their own time, saying, ‘Worship no one except Allah!’ They said, ‘Had our Lord wished, He would certainly have sent down angels [to us]. We indeed disbelieve in what you have been sent with.’","41:15":"As for [the people of] ‘a€d, they acted arrogantly in the earth unduly, and they said, ‘Who is more powerful than us?’ Did they not see that Allah, who created them, is more powerful than them? They used to impugn Our signs","41:16":"so We unleashed upon them an icy gale during ill-fated days, that We might make them taste the punishment of disgrace in the life of the world. Yet the punishment of the Hereafter is surely more disgraceful, and they will not be helped","41:17":"As for [the people of] Thamud, We guided them, but they preferred blindness to guidance.

He created you the first time, and to Him you are being brought back","41:22":"You did not use to conceal yourselves lest your hearing should bear witness against you, or [for that matter] your sight, or your skin, but you thought that Allah did not know most of what you did","41:23":"That misjudgment that you entertained about your Lord ruined you. So you became losers.’","41:24":"Should they be patient, the Fire is their abode; and should they seek to propitiate, they will not be redeemed","41:25":"We have assigned them companions who make to seem decorous to them whatever is before them and whatever is behind them, and the word became due against them, as it did against the nations that passed away before them of jinn and humans. They were indeed losers","41:26":"The faithless say, ‘Do not listen to this Qur’an and hoot it down so that you may prevail [over the Apostle].’","41:27":"We will surely make the faithless taste a severe punishment, and We will surely requite them by the worst of what they used to do","41:28":"That is the requital of the enemies of Allah —the Fire!

Their testimony will be written down and they shall be questioned","43:20":"They say, ‘Had the All-beneficent wished, we would not have worshipped them.’ They do not have any knowledge of that, and they do nothing but surmise","43:21":"Did We give them a Book before this, so that they are holding fast to it","43:22":"Rather they say, ‘We found our fathers following a creed, and we are indeed guided in their footsteps.’","43:23":"And so it has been that We did not send any warner to a town before you, without its affluent ones saying, ‘We found our fathers following a creed and we are indeed following in their footsteps.’","43:24":"He would say, ‘What! Even if I bring you a better guidance than what you found your fathers following?!’ They would say, ‘We indeed disbelieve in what you are sent with.’","43:25":"Thereupon We took vengeance on them; so observe how was the fate of the deniers","43:26":"When Abraham said to his father and his people, ‘I repudiate what you worship","43:27":"excepting Him who originated me; indeed He will guide me.’","43:28":"And He made it a lasting word among his posterity so that they may come back [to the right path]","43:29":"Rather I provided for these and their fathers until there came to them the truth and a manifest apostle","43:30":"But when the truth came to them, they said, ‘This is magic, and we indeed disbelieve in it.’","43:31":"And they said, ‘Why was not this Qur’an sent down to some great man from the two cities?’","43:32":"Is it they who dispense the mercy of your Lord? It is We who have dispensed among them their livelihood in the present life, and raised some of them above others in rank, so that some may take others into service, and your Lord’s mercy is better than what they amass","43:33":"Were it not [for the danger] that mankind would be one community, We would have surely made for those who defy the All-beneficent, silver roofs for their houses and [silver] stairways by which they ascend","43:34":"and [silver] doors for their houses and [silver] couches on which they recline","43:35":"and ornaments of gold; yet all that would be nothing but the wares of the life of this world, and the Hereafter near your Lord is for the Godwary","43:36":"Whoever turns a blind eye to the remembrance of the All-beneficent, We assign him a devil who remains his companion","43:37":"Indeed they bar them from the way while they suppose that they are [rightly] guided","43:38":"When he comes to Us, he will say, ‘I wish there had been between me and you the distance between east and west! What an evil companion [are you]!’","43:39":"‘Today that will be of no avail to you. As you did wrong, so will you share in the punishment.’","43:40":"Can you, then, make the deaf hear or guide the blind and someone who is in manifest error","43:41":"Either We shall take you away —for We will indeed take vengeance on them—","43:42":"or We shall show you what We have promised them, for indeed We hold them in Our power","43:43":"So hold fast to what has been revealed to you. Indeed you are on a straight path","43:44":"Indeed it is a reminder for you and for your people, and soon you will be questioned","43:45":"Ask those of Our apostles We have sent before you: Did We set up any gods besides the All-beneficent to be worshipped","43:46":"Certainly We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his elite. He said, ‘I am indeed an apostle of the Lord of all the worlds.’","43:47":"But when he brought them Our signs, behold, they laughed at them","43:48":"And We did not show them a sign but it was greater than the other, and We seized them with punishment so that they might come back","43:49":"They would say, ‘O magician! Invoke your Lord for us by the covenant He has made with you. We will indeed be guided.’","43:50":"But when We lifted the punishment from them, behold, they would break their pledge","43:51":"And Pharaoh proclaimed amongst his people. He said, ‘O my people! Does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me and these rivers that run at my feet? Do you not perceive","43:52":"Am I not better than this humble one who cannot even speak clearly","43:53":"Why have no bracelets of gold been cast upon him, nor have the angels come with him as escorts?’","43:54":"So he misled his people and they obeyed him. Indeed they were a transgressing lot","43:55":"So when they roused Our wrath, We took vengeance on them and drowned them all","43:56":"Thus We made them the vanguard and an example for posterity","43:57":"When the Son of Mary was cited as an example, behold, your people raise an outcry","43:58":"They say, ‘Are our gods better or he?’ They only cite him to you for the sake of contention.

This is a straight path","43:62":"Do not let Satan bar you [from the way of Allah]. Indeed he is your manifest enemy","43:63":"When Jesus brought the manifest proofs, he said, ‘I have certainly brought you wisdom, and [I have come] to make clear to you some of the things that you differ about. So be wary of Allah and obey me","43:64":"Indeed Allah is my Lord and your Lord; so worship Him. This is a straight path.’","43:65":"But the factions differed among themselves. So woe to the wrongdoers for the punishment of a painful day","43:66":"Do they await anything but that the Hour should overtake them suddenly, while they are unaware","43:67":"On that day, friends will be one another’s enemies, except for the Godwary","43:68":"[They will be told,] ‘O My servants!

Indeed the wrongdoers are allies of one another, but Allah is the guardian of the Godwary","45:20":"These are eye-openers for mankind, and guidance and mercy for a people who have certainty","45:21":"Do those who have perpetrated misdeeds suppose that We shall treat them as those who have faith and do righteous deeds, their life and death being equal? Evil is the judgement that they make","45:22":"Allah created the heavens and the earth with reason, so that every soul may be requited for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged","45:23":"Have you seen him who has taken his desire to be his god and whom Allah has led astray knowingly, and set a seal upon his hearing and his heart, and put a blindfold on his sight? So who will guide him after Allah?

He suffices as a witness between me and you, and He is the All-forgiving, the All-merciful.’","46:9":"Say, ‘I am not a novelty among the apostles, nor do I know what will be done with me, or with you. I just follow whatever is revealed to me, and I am just a manifest warner.’","46:10":"Say, ‘Tell me, if it is from Allah and you disbelieve in it, and a witness from the Children of Israel has testified to its like and believed [in it], while you are disdainful [of it]?’ Indeed Allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot","46:11":"The faithless say about the faithful, ‘Had it been [anything] good, they would not have taken the lead over us toward [accepting] it.’ And since they could not find the way to it, they will say, ‘It is an ancient lie.’","46:12":"Yet before it the Book of Moses was a guide and a mercy, and this is a Book which confirms it, in the Arabic language, to warn those who do wrong, and is a [bearer of] good news for the virtuous","46:13":"Indeed those who say, ‘Our Lord is Allah,’ and then remain steadfast, they will have no fear, nor will they grieve","46:14":"They shall be the inhabitants of paradise, remaining in it [forever] —a reward for what they used to do","46:15":"We have enjoined man to be kind to his parents. His mother has carried him in travail, and bore him in travail, and his gestation and weaning take thirty months. When he comes of age and reaches forty years, he says, ‘My Lord! Inspire me to give thanks for Your blessing with which You have blessed me and my parents, and that I may do righteous deeds which may please You, and invest my descendants with righteousness. Indeed I have turned to you in penitence, and I am one of the muslims.’","46:16":"Such are the ones from whom We accept the best of what they do, and overlook their misdeeds, [who will be] among the inhabitants of paradise —a true promise which they had been given","46:17":"As for him who says to his parents, ‘Fie on you! Do you promise me that I shall be raised [from the dead] when generations have passed away before me?’ And they invoke Allah’s help [and say]: ‘Woe to you! Believe! Indeed Allah’s promise is true.’ But he says, ‘These are nothing but myths of the ancients.’","46:18":"Such are the ones against whom the word became due concerning the nations that have passed away before them of jinn and humans. They were indeed the losers","46:19":"For each [person] there will be degrees [of merit] pertaining to what he has done, that He may recompense them fully for their works, and they will not be wronged","46:20":"The day when the faithless are exposed to the Fire, [they will be told,] ‘You have exhausted your good things in the life of the world and enjoyed them. So today you will be requited with a humiliating punishment for your acting arrogantly in the earth unduly, and because you used to transgress.’","46:21":"And mention [Hud] the brother of ‘a€d, when he warned his people at Aá¸¥qaf —and warners have passed away before and after him— saying, ‘Do not worship anyone but Allah.

Thus do We requite the guilty lot","46:26":"Certainly We had granted them power in respects that We have not granted you, and We had vested them with hearing and sight and hearts. But neither their hearing availed them nor did their sight, nor their hearts, in any way when they used to impugn the signs of Allah.

Rather they forsook them; and that was their lie and what they used to fabricate","46:29":"When We dispatched toward you a team of jinn listening to the Qur’an, when they were in its presence, they said, ‘Be silent!’ When it was finished, they went back to their people as warners","46:30":"They said, ‘O our people!

So shall anyone be destroyed except the transgressing lot","47:1":"Those who are [themselves] faithless and bar [others] from the way of Allah —He has made their works go awry","47:2":"But those who have faith and do righteous deeds and believe in what has been sent down to Muá¸¥ammad —and it is the truth from their Lord— He shall absolve them of their misdeeds and set right their affairs","47:3":"That is because the faithless follow falsehood, and because the faithful follow the truth from their Lord. That is how Allah draws comparisons for mankind","47:4":"When you meet the faithless in battle, strike their necks. When you have thoroughly decimated them, bind the captives firmly. Thereafter either oblige them [by setting them free] or take ransom till the war lays down its burdens. That [is Allah’s ordinance], and had Allah wished He could have taken vengeance on them, but that He may test some of you by means of others. As for those who were slain in the way of Allah, He will not let their works go awry","47:5":"He will guide them and set right their affairs","47:6":"and admit them into paradise with which He has acquainted them","47:7":"O you who have faith!

Allah destroyed them, and a similar [fate] awaits the faithless","47:11":"That is because Allah is the protector of the faithful, and because the faithless have no protector","47:12":"Indeed Allah will admit those who have faith and do righteous deeds into gardens with streams running in them. As for the faithless, they enjoy and eat just like the cattle eat, and the Fire will be their [final] abode","47:13":"How many a town there has been which was more powerful than your town which expelled you, which We have destroyed, and they had no helper","47:14":"Is he who stands on a manifest proof from his Lord like someone to whom the evil of his conduct is made to seem decorous, and who follow their desires","47:15":"A description of the paradise promised to the Godwary: therein are streams of unstaling water, and streams of milk unchanging in flavour, and streams of wine delicious to the drinkers, and streams of purified honey; there will be for them every kind of fruit in it, and forgiveness from their Lord.

He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down composure on them, and requited them with a victory near at hand","48:19":"and abundant spoils that they will capture, and Allah is all-mighty, all-wise","48:20":"Allah has promised you abundant spoils which you will capture. He has expedited this one for you, and withheld men’s hands from you, so that it may be a sign for the faithful, and that He may guide you to a straight path","48:21":"And other [spoils] which you have not yet captured: Allah has comprehended them, and Allah has power over all things","48:22":"If the faithless fight you, they will turn their backs [to flee].

You see them bowing and prostrating [in worship], seeking Allah’s grace and [His] pleasure. Their mark is [visible] on their faces, from the effect of prostration. Such is their description in the Torah and their description in the Evangel. Like a tillage that sends out its shoots and builds them up, and they grow stout and settle on their stalks, impressing the sowers, so that He may enrage the faithless by them. Allah has promised those of them who have faith and do righteous deeds forgiveness and a great reward","49:1":"O you who have faith! Do not venture ahead of Allah and His Apostle, and be wary of Allah. Indeed Allah is all-hearing, all-knowing","49:2":"O you who have faith!

Let not any people ridicule another people: it may be that they are better than they are; nor let women [ridicule] women: it may be that they are better than they are.

That is the great success.’","57:13":"The day the hypocrites, men and women, will say to the faithful, ‘Please let up on us, that we may glean something from your light!’ They will be told: ‘Go back and grope for light!’ Then there will be set up between them a wall with a gate, with mercy on its interior and punishment toward its exterior","57:14":"They will call out to them, ‘Did we not use to be with you?’ They will say, ‘Yes!

But as for those who are faithless and deny Our signs, they shall be the inmates of hell","57:20":"Know that the life of this world is just play and diversion, and glitter, and mutual vainglory among you and covetousness for wealth and children —like the rain whose vegetation impresses the farmer; then it withers and you see it turn yellow, then it becomes chaff, while in the Hereafter there is a severe punishment and forgiveness from Allah and His pleasure; and the life of this world is nothing but the wares of delusion","57:21":"Take the lead towards forgiveness from your Lord and a paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who have faith in Allah and His apostles. That is Allah’s grace, which He grants to whomever He wishes, and Allah is dispenser of a great grace","57:22":"No affliction visits the earth or yourselves but it is in a Book before We bring it about —that is indeed easy for Allah—","57:23":"so that you may not grieve for what escapes you, nor exult for what comes your way, and Allah does not like any swaggering braggart","57:24":"Such as are [themselves] stingy and bid [other] people to be stingy. And whoever refuses to comply [should know that] indeed Allah is the All-sufficient, the All-laudable","57:25":"Certainly We sent Our apostles with manifest proofs, and We sent down with them the Book and the Balance, so that mankind may maintain justice; and We sent down iron, in which there is great might and uses for mankind, and so that Allah may know those who help Him and His apostles in [their] absence. Indeed Allah is all-strong, all-mighty","57:26":"Certainly We sent Noah and Abraham and We ordained among their descendants prophethood and the Book. Some of them are [rightly] guided, and many of them are transgressors","57:27":"Then We followed them up with Our apostles and We followed [them] with Jesus son of Mary, and We gave him the Evangel, and We put in the hearts of those who followed him kindness and mercy.

So We gave to the faithful among them their [due] reward, but many of them are transgressors","57:28":"O you who have faith! Be wary of Allah and have faith in His Apostle. He will grant you a double share of His mercy and give you a light to walk by, and forgive you, and Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful","57:29":"so that the People of the Book may know that they have no power over anything of Allah’s grace, and that all grace is in Allah’s hand which He grants to whomever He wishes and Allah is dispenser of a great grace","58:1":"Allah has certainly heard the speech of her who pleads with you about her husband and complains to Allah. Allah hears the conversation between the two of you.

Indeed Allah is all-excusing, all-forgiving","58:3":"Those who repudiate their wives by Zihar and then retract what they have said, shall set free a slave before they may touch each other. This you are advised [to carry out], and Allah is well aware of what you do","58:4":"He who can not afford [to free a slave] shall fast for two successive months before they may touch each other. If he cannot [do so], he shall feed sixty needy persons. This, that you may have faith in Allah and His Apostle. These are Allah’s bounds, and there is a painful punishment for the faithless","58:5":"Indeed those who oppose Allah and His Apostle will be subdued just as were subdued those before them. We have certainly sent down manifest signs, and there is a humiliating punishment for the faithless","58:6":"The day when Allah will raise them all together, He will inform them about what they have done. Allah has kept account of it, while they forgot it, and Allah is witness to all things","58:7":"Have you not regarded that Allah knows whatever there is in the heavens and whatever there is in the earth? There is no secret talk among three, but He is their fourth [companion], nor among five but He is their sixth, nor less than that, nor more, but He is with them wherever they may be. Then He will inform them about what they have done on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed Allah has knowledge of all things","58:8":"Have you not regarded those who were forbidden from secret talks but again resumed what they had been forbidden from, and hold secret talks [imbued] with sin and transgression and disobedience to the Apostle? And when they come to you they greet you with that with which Allah never greeted you, and they say to themselves, ‘Why does not Allah punish us for what we say?!’ Let hell suffice them: they shall enter it; and it is an evil destination","58:9":"O you who have faith! When you talk secretly, do not hold secret talks [imbued] with sin and aggression and disobedience to the Apostle, but talk secretly in [a spirit of] piety and Godfearing, and be wary of Allah toward whom you will be mustered","58:10":"Indeed [malicious] secret talks are from Satan, that he may upset the faithful, but he cannot harm them in any way except by Allah’s leave, and in Allah let all the faithful put their trust","58:11":"O you who have faith! When you are told, ‘Make room,’ in sittings, then do make room; Allah will make room for you. And when you are told, ‘Rise up!’ Do rise up. Allah will raise those of you who have faith and those who have been given knowledge in rank, and Allah is well aware of what you do","58:12":"O you who have faith! When you talk secretly to the Apostle, offer a charity before your secret talk. That is better for you and purer. But if you cannot afford [to make the offering], then Allah is indeed all-forgiving, all-merciful","58:13":"Were you apprehensive of offering charities before your secret talks? So, as you did not do it, and Allah was clement to you, maintain the prayer and pay the zakat, and obey Allah and His Apostle. And Allah is well aware of what you do","58:14":"Have you not regarded those who befriend a people at whom Allah is wrathful? They neither belong to you, nor to them, and they swear false oaths [that they are with you] and they know","58:15":"Allah has prepared a severe punishment for them. Evil indeed is what they used to do","58:16":"They make a shield of their oaths and bar [people] from the way of Allah; so there is a humiliating punishment for them","58:17":"Their possessions and children will not avail them in any way against Allah. They shall be the inmates of the Fire and they shall remain in it [forever]","58:18":"The day when Allah will raise them all together, they will swear to Him, just like they swear to you [now], supposing that they stand on something. Look! They are indeed liars","58:19":"Satan has prevailed upon them, so he has caused them to forget the remembrance of Allah. They are Satan’s confederates. Look! Indeed it is Satan’s confederates who are the losers","58:20":"Indeed those who oppose Allah and His Apostle —they will be among the most abased","58:21":"Allah has ordained: ‘I shall surely prevail, I and My apostles.’ Indeed Allah is all-strong, all-mighty","58:22":"You will not find a people believing in Allah and the Last Day endearing those who oppose Allah and His Apostle even though they were their own parents, or children, or brothers, or kinsfolk. [For] such, He has written faith into their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Him. He will admit them into gardens with streams running in them, to remain in them [forever], Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. They are Allah’s confederates. Look! The confederates of Allah are indeed felicitous","59:1":"Whatever there is in the heavens glorifies Allah and whatever there is in the earth, and He is the All-mighty, the All-wise","59:2":"It is He who expelled the faithless belonging to the People of the Book from their homes at the outset of [their] en masse banishment. You did not think that they would go out, and they thought their fortresses would protect them from Allah. But Allah came at them from whence they did not reckon and He cast terror into their hearts. They demolish their houses with their own hands and the hands of the faithful. So take lesson, O you who have insight","59:3":"If Allah had not ordained banishment for them, He would have surely punished them in this world, and in the Hereafter there is for them the punishment of the Fire","59:4":"That is because they defied Allah and His Apostle; and whoever defies Allah, indeed Allah is severe in retribution","59:5":"Whatever palm trees you cut down or left standing on their roots, it was by Allah’s will, and in order that He may disgrace the transgressors","59:6":"The spoils that Allah gave to His Apostle from them, you did not spur any horse for its sake, nor any riding camel, but Allah makes His apostles prevail over whomever He wishes, and Allah has power over all things","59:7":"The spoils that Allah gave to His Apostle from the people of the townships, are for Allah and the Apostle, the relatives and the orphans, the needy and the traveller, so that they do not circulate among the rich among you. Take whatever the Apostle gives you, and relinquish whatever he forbids you, and be wary of Allah. Indeed Allah is severe in retribution","59:8":"[They are also] for the poor Emigrants who have been expelled from their homes and [wrested of] their possessions, who seek grace from Allah and [His] pleasure and help Allah and His Apostle. It is they who are the truthful","59:9":"[They are as well] for those who were settled in the land and [abided] in faith before them, who love those who migrate toward them, and do not find in their breasts any need for that which is given to them, but prefer [the Immigrants] to themselves, though poverty be their own lot. And those who are saved from their own greed —it is they who are the felicitous","59:10":"And [also for] those who came in after them, who say, ‘Our Lord, forgive us and our brethren who were our forerunners in the faith, and do not put any rancour in our hearts toward the faithful. Our Lord, You are indeed most kind and merciful.’","59:11":"Have you not regarded the hypocrites who say to their brethren, the faithless from among the People of the Book: ‘If you are expelled, we will surely go out with you, and we will never obey anyone against you, and if you are fought against we will surely help you,’ and Allah bears witness that they are indeed liars","59:12":"Surely, if they were expelled they would not go out with them, and if they were fought against they would not help them, and were they to help them they would surely turn their backs [to flee] and then they would not be helped","59:13":"Indeed they have a greater awe of you in their hearts than of Allah. That is because they are a lot who do not understand","59:14":"They will not fight against you in a body except in fortified townships or from behind walls. Their might is great among themselves. You suppose them to be a body, but their hearts are disunited. That is because they are a lot who do not apply reason","59:15":"like those who, recently before them, tasted the evil consequences of their conduct, and there is a painful punishment for them","59:16":"[Or] like Satan, when he prompts man to renounce faith, then, when he renounces faith, he says, ‘Indeed I am absolved of you. Indeed I fear Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.’","59:17":"So the fate of both is that they will be in the Fire, to remain in it [forever]. Such is the requital of the wrongdoers","59:18":"O you who have faith! Be wary of Allah, and let every soul consider what it sends ahead for tomorrow, and be wary of Allah.
