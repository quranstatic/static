When it lights all around him, God took away his light and left them in darkness","2:18":"Deaf, dumb, and blind, they will not return to the path","2:19":"Or it is like that of a rain-laden cloud from the sky. In it are zones of darkness, thunder and lightning. They press their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap, while in fear of death, but God encompasses those who reject faith","2:20":"The lightning nearly snatches away their sight. Every time the light flashes before them they walk in it. But when darkness covers them they stand still. And if God willed, He could take away their ability to hear and see, for God has power over all things","2:21":"O you people, adore your Guardian Lord, Who created you and those who came before you, that you may become righteous","2:22":"Who has made the earth your couch, and the skies your canopy, and sent down rain from the skies, and grew with it fruits for your sustenance.

Will you not understand","2:45":"No, seek help with patient-perseverance and prayer. It is indeed hard, except for those who bring a humble spirit","2:46":"Who remember with certainty that they are to meet their Lord, and that they will return to Him","2:47":"O Children of Israel, call to mind the favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all others","2:48":"Guard against a day when one soul will not avail another, nor will intercession be accepted for her, nor will compensation be taken from her, nor will they be helped","2:49":"And remember We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh. They gave you hard work and punishment, slaughtered your males, and let your females live, this was a tremendous trial from your Lord","2:50":"And remember We divided the sea for you, We saved you and drowned Pharaoh’s people, and you saw it with your own eyes","2:51":"And remember We appointed forty nights for Moses, and in his absence, you took the calf, and you did a great wrong","2:52":"Even then, We forgave you, and there was a chance for you to be grateful","2:53":"And remember We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion. There was a chance for you to be guided aright","2:54":"And remember Moses said to his people, “O my people, You have indeed wronged yourselves by your worship of the calf. So turn to your Maker, and slay yourselves, that will be better for you in the sight of your Maker.” Then He forgave you, for He is Oft-Forgiving, the Merciful Redeemer","2:55":"And remember you said, “O Moses, we will never believe in you until we see God with our own eyes,” but you were dazed with thunder and lightning even as you looked on","2:56":"Then when We raised you up after your death, you had the chance to be grateful","2:57":"And We gave you shade from clouds, and sent down to you manna and quail. Eat of the good things We have provided for you. To Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own selves","2:58":"And remember We said, “Enter this town, and eat of the plenty therein as you wish, but enter the gate with humility, in posture and in word, and We will remove your faults and increase those who do right.”","2:59":"But the transgressors changed a word from that which had been given them, so We sent on the transgressors a plague from heaven, because they ignored repeatedly","2:60":"And remember Moses prayed for water for his people. We said, “Split the rock with your staff.” Then there gushed forth from it twelve springs. Each group knew its place for water. So eat and drink of the sustenance provided by God, and do no wrong on the earth","2:61":"And remember you said, “O Moses, we cannot endure one kind of food, so ask your Lord for us to produce for us what the earth grows, its pot herbs and cucumbers, its garlic, lentils, and onions.” He said, “Will you exchange what is better for what is worse? Go down to any town and you will find what you want.” They were covered with humiliation and misery. They brought on themselves the punishment of God. This is because they went on rejecting the signs of God and slaying His messengers without just cause. This is because they rebelled and went on transgressing","2:62":"Those who believe, and those who are Jewish, and the Christians, and the Sabaeans, and any who believe in God and the Last Day, and work righteousness, they will have their reward with their Lord, on them will be no fear, nor shall they grieve","2:63":"And remember We took your covenant, and We raised above you the Mountain saying, “Hold firm to what We have given you and bring it to remembrance so that perhaps you may be aware.”","2:64":"But you turned back thereafter. Had it not been for the grace and mercy of God to you, you would have surely been among the lost","2:65":"And you knew well those among you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath. We said to them, “Become apes, despised and rejected.”","2:66":"So We made it a lesson in their own time, and for their descendants, and a lesson to those who are aware of God","2:67":"And remember Moses said to his people, “God commands that you sacrifice a heifer.” They said, “Are you trying to make a fool of us?” He said, “I seek refuge with God from being ignorant.”","2:68":"They said, “Ask your Lord on our behalf to make plain to us what heifer it is.” He said, “He says the heifer should be neither too old nor too young, but of middle age, now do what you are asked.”","2:69":"They said, “Ask your Lord on our behalf to make plain to us its color.” He said, “He says a fawn-colored heifer, natural and rich in tone, the admiration of all beholders.”","2:70":"They said, “Ask your Lord on our behalf to make clear to us which kind, to us all heifers are alike. We indeed wish for guidance, if God wills.”","2:71":"He said, “He says, a heifer not trained to till the soil or water the fields, healthy and without blemish.” They said, “Now you have brought the truth.” Then they offered it in sacrifice, but without good intentions","2:72":"Remember you killed a person and argued among yourselves concerning the crime, but God would expose what you hid","2:73":"So We said, “Strike him with a part of it.” This is like the way God brings the dead to life. He shows you His signs that perhaps you may understand","2:74":"Then your hearts were hardened, they became like a rock, or even worse in hardness, for even among rocks there are some from which rivers gush forth. Others when split open, send forth water.

Woe to them for what their hands write, and for the gain they make with it","2:80":"But they say, “The fire will not touch us, except for just a few number of days.” Say, “Have you taken a promise from God, for He never breaks His promise? Or is it that you say of God what you do not know?”","2:81":"No, those who wrongfully seek gain, and are surrounded by wrong, they are companions of the fire, and they will live there forever","2:82":"But those who have faith and work righteousness, they are companions of the paradise, they will live there forever","2:83":"And remember We took this covenant from the Children of Israel, “Worship none but God, treat with kindness your parents and other family, and orphans, and those in need, speak fair to people, be steadfast in prayer, and give zakat. Then you turned back, except a few among you, and you backslide","2:84":"And remember We took this covenant, “Shed no blood among you, nor banish your own people from your homes.” And this you solemnly ratified, and to this, you can bear witness","2:85":"After this it is you, the same people who slay those among yourselves, and banish a group of you from their homes, assist others against them in wrong and transgression, and if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, though it was not permissible for you to banish them. So is it only parts of the Book that you believe in, and do you reject the rest? But what is the reward for those among you who behave like this, except disgrace in this life, and on the Day of Accountability, they will be assigned to the most terrible penalty, for God is not unmindful of what you do","2:86":"These are the people who buy the life of the present at the price of the hereafter. Their penalty will not be lightened nor will they be helped","2:87":"We gave Moses the Book, and followed him with a succession of prophets. We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, guidance and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. Is it that whenever there comes to you a messenger with what you do not desire, you are puffed up with pride? Some you called impostors, and others you slay","2:88":"They say, “Our hearts are the wrappings which preserves God’s words. We need no more” No, God's curse is on them for their blasphemy. Little is it they believe","2:89":"And when there comes to them a book from God reflecting the truth of what is with them, although they prayed for victory against those without faith. When there comes to them that which they recognized, they refused to believe in it, but the curse of God is on those without faith","2:90":"Miserable is the price for which they have sold their souls, for they deny that which God has sent down, because in insolent envy they disapprove that God, of His grace, should send it to any of His servants He pleases. So they have drawn on themselves wrath upon wrath, and humiliating is the punishment for those who reject faith","2:91":"When it is said to them, “Believe in what God has sent down,” they say, “We believe in what was sent down to us.” And they reject all else, even if it is truth reflecting what is with them. Say, “Why then have you slain the Prophets of God throughout history if you did indeed believe?”","2:92":"Moses came to you with guidance, yet you worshipped the calf even after that, and you behaved wrongfully","2:93":"And remember We took your sacred agreement, and We raised above you the Mountain saying, “Hold firmly to what We have given you and listen to it”. They said, “We hear but we do not follow.” So they had to drink into their hearts from the calf, because of their faithlessness. Say, “Evil is what encourages you to do it, as well as your incorrect faith, if you are in fact believers in that faith.”","2:94":"Say, “If the last home with God is for you alone, and not for anyone else, then seek death if you are sincere.”","2:95":"But they will never seek death, because of that which their hands have sent before them, and God is well acquainted with the wrongdoers","2:96":"You will indeed find them, of all people, most greedy of life, even more than the idolaters. Each one of them wishes that he could be given a life of a thousand years, but the granting of such life will not save him from punishment, because God sees well all that they do","2:97":"Say, whoever is an enemy to Gabriel, though he brings down to your heart, by God's will, a reflection of the truth that went before, guidance and good news for those who believe","2:98":"Whoever is an enemy to God, His angels and messengers, and to Gabriel and Michael, God then is an enemy to those who do not believe","2:99":"We have sent down to you clear signs, and none reject them except those who are perverse","2:100":"Is it not that every time they make a covenant, some group among them throw it aside? Certainly, most of them are faithless","2:101":"And when there came to them a messenger from God, reflecting the truth of what was with them, a group of the people of the Book threw away the Book of God behind their backs, as if they did not know it","2:102":"They followed what the devils recited against the power of Solomon. The blasphemer was not Solomon, but the devils, teaching human beings illusions, and such things as came down at Babylon to the angels Harut and Marut, but neither of these taught anyone without saying, “We are only a trial, so do not blaspheme.” They learned from them the means to sow discord between husband and wife. But they could not harm anyone except by God's permission. And they learned what harmed them, not what profited them. And they knew that the buyers of wrong would have no share in the happiness of the hereafter, and awful was the price for which they sold their souls, if they but knew","2:103":"But if they had kept their faith and guarded themselves from harm, far better would have been the reward from their Lord, if they only knew","2:104":"O you people of faith, say not words of ambiguity, but words of respect, and act urgently. And for those without faith is a terrible punishment","2:105":"It is never the wish of those without faith among the people of the Book, nor of the pagans, that anything good should come down to you from your Lord. But God will choose for His special mercy whom He wills, for God is Lord of grace abounding","2:106":"None of Our revelations do We allow to be lost, but We substitute something better or similar. Do you not know that God has power over all things","2:107":"Do you not know that to God belongs the control of the heavens and the earth? And besides Him, you have neither patron nor helper","2:108":"Would you question your messenger as Moses was questioned previously? But whoever changes from belief to unbelief has strayed without doubt from the balanced way","2:109":"Many of the people of the Book wish they could turn you back to infidelity after you have believed. To selfish envy, after the truth has become manifest to them. But forgive and overlook until God accomplishes His purpose. For God has power over all things","2:110":"And be steadfast in prayer and give zakat, and whatever good you send ahead for your souls before you, you will find it with God, for God sees well all that you do","2:111":"And they say, “None will enter paradise unless he is Jewish or Christian.” Those are merely their desires. Say, “Produce your proof if you are right.”","2:112":"No, whoever submits his whole self to God and is a doer of good, he will receive his reward with his Guardian Evolver. On them will be no fear, nor shall they grieve","2:113":"Jews say, “The Christians have nothing to stand upon. And Christians say, “Jews have nothing to stand upon.” Yet they all read the Book. Their words are like those who know not. But God will judge between them in their quarrel on the Day of Accountability","2:114":"And who is more unjust than he who forbids in places for the worship of God, that God's name should be praised, and whose zeal is to ruin them? It was not fitting that they should enter them except in fear. For them there is nothing but disgrace in the present, and in the hereafter, an exceeding torment","2:115":"To God belong the East and West. Wherever you turn, there is the Presence of God, for God is Ever Present, All Knowing","2:116":"They say, “God has a son, glory be to him.” No, to God belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth, and everything renders worship to Him","2:117":"From Him is the origin of the heavens and the earth, when He decrees a matter He says to it: “Be”. And it is","2:118":"Those without knowledge say, “Why does God not speak to us, or why does a sign not come to us?” As did the people say before them. Their words are similar, and their hearts are alike. We have indeed made clear the signs to any who hold firmly to faith","2:119":"Indeed We have sent you, in truth, as a bearer of good news and a warner. But no question will be asked of you from the companions of the blazing fire","2:120":"Never will Jews or Christians be satisfied with you unless you follow their way. Say, “The way of God, that is the only way.” If you followed their desires after the knowledge has reached you, then you would find neither protector nor helper","2:121":"Those to whom We have sent the Book, read it as it should be read, they are the ones who believe. Those who do not believe, the loss is their own","2:122":"O Children of Israel, call to mind the favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I preferred you to all others","2:123":"So guard yourselves against a day when no soul will avail another, nor will compensation be accepted from her, nor will intercession profit her, nor will anyone be helped","2:124":"And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands which he fulfilled. He said, “I will make you a leader of the nations.” He pleaded, “And also from my offspring.” He answered, “But My promise is not within reach of the wrongdoers.”","2:125":"Remember We made the House a place of assembly for humanity and a place of safety. And take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer. And We made a covenant with Abraham and Ishmael, that they should redeem My house for those who circle it, or use it as a retreat, or bow, or prostrate themselves","2:126":"And remember Abraham said, “My Lord, make this a city of peace, and feed its people with fruit, those of them who believe in God and the Last Day.” He said, “And those who do not believe, I will grant them their pleasure for a while, but will soon drive them to the torment of the fire, a miserable destination indeed.”","2:127":"And remember Abraham and Ishmael raised the foundations of the House with this prayer, “Our Lord, accept this from us. Indeed You alone are the All Hearing, the All Knowing.”","2:128":"“Our Lord, make us people of peace, raise from our offspring people at peace, teach us ways to worship, and forgive us, indeed You are Most Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming.”","2:129":"“Our Lord, send among them a messenger of their own who will rehearse Your signs to them, instruct them in scripture and wisdom, and sanctify them, for You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise.”","2:130":"And who would turn away from the way of Abraham, except to debase their souls? We chose him and rendered him refined in this life. And he will be in the hereafter among the righteous","2:131":"Behold, his Lord said to him, “Bow down.” He said, “I do bow to the Lord of the universe.”","2:132":"And this was the legacy that Abraham left to his sons, as did Jacob. He said, “Oh my sons, God has chosen the way for you, so die not except as those at peace.”","2:133":"Were you witnesses when death appeared before Jacob? Behold, he said to his sons, “What will you worship after me?” They said, “We will worship your God and the God of your fathers Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac, the one God, and to Him we bow.”","2:134":"That was a community who passed away. They will reap the fruit of what they sow, and you of what you sow. And you will not be asked about what they used to do","2:135":"They say, “Become Jews or Christians if you are to be guided.” Say, “No, enough is the philosophy of Abraham the true, and he did not join gods with God.”","2:136":"Say, “We believe in God, and the revelation given to us, and to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given to the other prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between them, and we are at peace with Him.”","2:137":"So if they believe as you believe, they are indeed on the right path. But if they turn back, they are in disunity. But God will suffice for you against them, and He is the All Hearing, the All Knowing","2:138":"The baptism of God, who can baptize better than God? And it is He Whom we worship","2:139":"Say, “Will you dispute with us about God, seeing that He is our Lord and your Lord? That we are responsible for our deeds, and you for yours? And that We are sincere before Him","2:140":"“Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say, “Do you know better than God? Who is more unjust than those who conceal the testimony they have from God, and God is not unmindful of what you do.”","2:141":"They were a community who have passed away. They will reap the fruit of what they sow, and you of what you sow. And you will not be asked about what they used to do. 141 (End of Part)","2:142":"The foolish among the people will say, “What has turned them from the qibla to which they were accustomed?” Say, “To God belong both East and West, He guides whom He wills to a straight way.”","2:143":"Thus we have made you a balanced community, that you might be witnesses over the nations, and the messenger a witness over you. And We appointed the qibla from that which you were used to, only to make evident he who followed the messenger and he who would turn on his heels. Indeed it was momentous, except for those guided by God. And never would God make your faith meaningless, for God is to all people full of kindness, the Merciful Redeemer","2:144":"We see you turning your face to the heavens. Now We will turn you to a qibla that will please you. So turn your face in the direction of the Sacred Masjid. Wherever you are, turn your faces in that direction. The people of the Book know well that it is the truth from their Lord, nor is God unmindful of what they do","2:145":"Even if you were to bring to the people of the Book all the signs at once, they would not follow your qibla, nor are you going to follow their qibla, nor will they follow each other’s qibla. If you, after the knowledge has reached you, follow their desires, you are then clearly in the wrong","2:146":"The people of the Book know this as they know their own children. But some of them conceal the truth which they know","2:147":"The truth is from your Lord, so do not be among those in doubt","2:148":"To each is a goal to which God turns them. So strive together towards all that is good. Wherever you are, God will bring you together, for God has power over all things","2:149":"From wherever you are, turn your face in the direction of the Sacred Masjid. That is indeed the truth from the Guardian Evolver. And God is not unmindful of what you do","2:150":"And from wherever you start out, turn your face in the direction of the Sacred Masjid. Wherever you are, turn your face in that direction. There is no grounds of dispute for you among the people, except those of them who are bent on corruption. So do not fear them, but fear Me, so that I may complete My favor on you, and so that you may be guided","2:151":"And We have sent among you a messenger of your own, rehearsing to you Our signs, and helping to refine you, and teaching you the book and the wisdom, and that which you did not know","2:152":"Then remember Me, I will remember you. Be grateful to Me, and do not reject it","2:153":"O you who believe, seek help with patient perseverance and prayer. For God is with those who patiently persevere","2:154":"And do not say of those who are slain in the way of God, “They are dead.” No, they are living, though you cannot see them","2:155":"Know that We will challenge you with something of fear and hunger, some loss in goods or lives, or your fruits. But give good news to those who patiently persevere","2:156":"That say when afflicted with calamity, “To God we belong, and to Him is our reversion.”","2:157":"They are those on whom descend blessings from God— and mercy. And they are the ones who receive guidance","2:158":"Behold, Safa and Marwa are among the symbols of God. So whoever circles the House while performing Hajj or Umra, there is no wrong in that. And whoever follows his own impulse to do good, be sure that God is He Who recognizes and knows it","2:159":"Those who conceal the clear signs We have sent down, and the guidance, after We have made it clear for the people in the Book, on them is God's curse, a curse for those deserving curse","2:160":"Except those who repent and make it right, and openly declare it. To them I turn, for I am Oft-Returning, Mercifully Redeeming","2:161":"Those who do not believe and die rejecting, on them is God's curse, and the curse of the angels, and all humanity","2:162":"They will live there. Their penalty will not be lightened, nor will they be given respite","2:163":"And your God is One God. There is no god but He, the Merciful Benefactor, the Merciful Redeemer","2:164":"Indeed in the creation of the heavens and the earth. In the alternation of the night and the day. In the sailing of the ships through the ocean for the profit of humanity. In the rain that God sends down from the skies. And the life which He gives to land that is dead. In the creatures of all kinds that He scatters through the earth. In the change of the winds, and the clouds which they trail like their slaves between the sky and the earth. Indeed in these are signs for people who are wise","2:165":"Yet there are people who take others besides God as equals. They love them as they should love God.

No harm ever touched them, for they followed the blessings of God, and God is the Lord of bounties unbounded","3:175":"It is Satan that suggests to you the fear of his allies. Do not be afraid of them, but instead fear Me, if you have faith","3:176":"Do not let those grieve you who rush into unbelief. Not the least harm will they do to God. God's plan is that He will give them no portion in the hereafter, except a severe punishment","3:177":"Those who purchase unbelief at the price of faith, not the least harm will they do to God, but they will have a terrible punishment","3:178":"Let not the unbelievers think that Our respite to them is good for them. We grant them respite so that they may increase their sins, but they will have a shameful punishment","3:179":"God will not leave the believers in the state in which you are in now, until He separates what is harmful from what is good, nor will He disclose to you the secrets of the unseen.

And do not take their sustenance by mixing it up with your own, for this is a great sin indeed","4:3":"If you fear you will be unable to deal justly with the orphans, then marry women of your choice, two, three, or four. But if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly with them, then only one, or one whom your right hands possess. That would be better to prevent you from doing injustice","4:4":"And give the women their dowry. But if they, of their own free will, return any part of it to you, take it and enjoy it with gratefulness","4:5":"And those weak in understanding, do not put them in charge of your property which God has made a means of support for you. But feed and clothe them, and speak to them words of kindness and justice","4:6":"Train and educate the orphans until they reach the age of marriage. When you find that they have good judgment, release their property to them. Do not consume it wastefully, nor in haste before they grow up. If the guardian is well off, let them claim no compensation. But if they are poor, let them have for themselves what is just and reasonable. When you release their property to them, have witnesses in their presence, although sufficient is God in taking account","4:7":"From what is left by parents and those nearest related, there is a share for men and a share for women, whether the property be small or large, a determined share","4:8":"But if at the time of division there are other relatives, or orphans, or other people in need present, then provide for them out of the property, and speak to them words of kindness and justice","4:9":"Let those disposing of an estate have the same considerations in mind as they would if they had left their own dependents behind.

If no children and the parents are the only heirs, the mother has a third. If the deceased left brothers or sisters, the mother has a sixth. These distributions, in all cases, are after the payment of estate tax and debt. You do not know whether your parents or your children are nearer to you in benefit. These are settled portions ordained by God, and God is All Knowing, All Wise","4:12":"In what your wives leave, your share is a half, if they leave no child, but if they leave a child, you get a fourth, after payment of estate tax and debt. In what you leave, their share is a fourth, if you leave no child, but if you leave a child, they get an eighth, after payment of estate tax and debt. If the male or female whose inheritance is in question has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth, but if more than two, they share in a third, after payment of estate tax and debt, so that no loss is caused to anyone.

For them We have prepared a punishment most terrible","4:19":"O you who believe, you are forbidden to marry women against their will, nor should you treat them with harshness by taking away part of the dowry you have given them, except when they have been guilty of open lewdness. Instead, live with them in kindness. If you take a disliking to them, it may be that you dislike something with which God brings a great deal of good","4:20":"But if you decide to place a spouse in the place of the other, even if you had given the latter a whole treasure as a dowry, do not take the least bit of it back. Would you take it by slander and manifest wrong","4:21":"And how could you take it when you have bonded with each other, and they have taken from you a solemn covenant","4:22":"Do not marry women whom your fathers married, except what has undoubtedly passed.

God has ordained this for you. And except for these, all others are permissible, provided you pursue them with gifts from your property, desiring chastity, not lust. Seeing that you are given blessings from them, give them their dowries as prescribed. But if after a dowry is prescribed you agree to modify it, there is no blame on you, and God is All Knowing, All Wise","4:25":"If any of you do not have the means to wed mature believing women, you may wed less mature believing women from among those whom your right hand possess. But God has full knowledge of your faith. Some of you are from the others. So wed them with the permission of their family, and give them their dowries according to what is reasonable. They should be chaste, not lustful, nor should they have illicit relationships. After they are taken in wedlock, if they fall into wrong, their punishment is half of that for mature women. This is for those among you who fear doing wrong. And it is better for you to practice self-restraint, but God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","4:26":"God wishes to make clear to you and to guide you to the ways of those before you, and to turn to you, for God is All Knowing, All Wise","4:27":"God wishes to accept your repentance, but the wish of those who follow their passions is that you should turn away, far away","4:28":"God wills to lighten your difficulties, for the human being was created fragile","4:29":"O you who believe, do not consume your property among yourselves with vanity, but let there be among you traffic and trade by mutual good will, nor kill yourselves, for indeed God has been to you Mercifully Redeeming","4:30":"If any do so with hatred and injustice, soon will We cast them into the fire, and that is easy for God","4:31":"If you avoid the most heinous of things that you are forbidden to do, We will remove from you your desire to do wrong, and admit you to a gate of great honor","4:32":"And in no way covet those things that God bestowed on some more than others. To males belongs what they earn, and to females what they earn, but ask God for His bounty, for God has full knowledge of all things","4:33":"For everyone, We have appointed shares and heirs to property left by parents and relatives. And also to those whom your right hand possess. Give their due portion, for truly God is witness to all things","4:34":"Men and women support one another, because God has given each of them more than the other, and because they spend from their wealth. So the righteous women, being loyal, maintain in their absence what God would have them maintain. As for those who you suspect disloyalty, advise them, refrain from sleeping with them, and separate from them. However, if they return to loyalty, do not try to harm them, for God is the Most High, the Great","4:35":"If you fear a split between the two, appoint two arbiters, one from his family, and the other from hers. And if they wish for peace, God will cause their reconciliation, for God has full knowledge and is acquainted with all things","4:36":"Serve God, and do not join any partners with Him. And do good to parents and other family, orphans, those in need, neighbors who are near, neighbors who are strangers, the companion by your side, displaced persons, and those whom your right hand possess, for God does not love the arrogant, the vainglorious","4:37":"Nor those who are greedy or recommend greediness to others, or hide the bounties which God has bestowed on them. We have prepared for those who reject it, a crushing punishment","4:38":"And for those who give of their sustenance to be seen by people, but have no faith in God and the Last Day. And if any take Satan for their intimate, then what a harmful intimate he is","4:39":"And how will it harm them if they had faith in God and in the Last Day, and if they spent from what God has given them for sustenance? And God has full knowledge of them","4:40":"God is never unjust in the least degree. If there is any good, He doubles it, and gives from His own presence a great reward","4:41":"It is how We brought from each people a witness, and We brought you as a witness against these people","4:42":"On that day, those who do not believe and did not follow the messenger, will wish that the earth were made one with them, but never will they hide a single fact from God","4:43":"O you who believe, do not approach prayer with a confused mind, until you can understand all that you say. Nor in a state of ceremonial impurity, until after washing your entire body. If you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you come from offices of nature, or you have been intimate with your woman, and you find no water, then take for yourselves earth, and rub your faces and hands with it, for God removes sins and forgives again and again","4:44":"Have you not turned Your vision to those who were given a portion of the Book? They deal in wrong, and wish that you would lose the right path","4:45":"But God has full knowledge of your enemies. God is enough for a protector, and God is enough for a helper","4:46":"Of the Jews, there are some who displace words from their places and say, “We hear and we do not follow,” and “Hear what is not heard,” and “Ra’ina,” with a twist of their tongues and a slander to faith. If only they had said, “We hear and we follow,” and “Do hear,” and “Do look at us,” it would have been better for them, and more proper. But God has cursed them for their unbelief, still few from those will believe","4:47":"O you people of the Book, believe in what We have revealed, reflecting the truth of what was with you, before We change the face of some beyond all recognition, and turn them backward, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath breakers, for the decision of God must be carried out","4:48":"God does not forgive that partners be established with Him, but He forgives anything else, to whom He pleases. But to establish partners with God is to commit a sin most heinous indeed","4:49":"Have you not turned your vision to those who claim purity for themselves? No, but God purifies who He wills. And never will they fail to receive justice in the least","4:50":"See how they invent a lie against God? But that in of itself is clearly a sin","4:51":"Have you not turned Your vision to those who were given a portion of the Book? They believe in illusions and wrongdoing, and say to the unbelievers that they are better guided to the way than the believers","4:52":"They are the people whom God has cursed, and those whom God has cursed, you will find that they have no one to help","4:53":"Do they have a share in control or power? Behold, they give nothing to their society","4:54":"Or do they envy people for what God has given them of His bounty? But We had already given the people of Abraham the Book, and the Wisdom, and conferred upon them a great kingdom","4:55":"Some of them believed, and some of them turned their faces from him. And enough is hell for a burning fire","4:56":"Those who reject our signs, We will soon cast into the fire. As often as their skin is roasted through, We will change them for fresh skin, that they may taste the penalty. For God is Exalted in Power, the Wise","4:57":"But those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, We will soon admit to gardens with rivers flowing beneath, their eternal home. There they will have companions refined. We will admit them to shade, ever-widening","4:58":"God commands you to render back your trusts to those to whom they are due. And that when you judge between people, you judge with justice. How excellent indeed is the teaching which He gives you, for God is He Who hears and sees all things","4:59":"O you who believe, follow God and follow the messenger, and those given authority among you. If you differ among yourselves, refer it to God and His messenger, if you do believe in God and the Last Day, that is best, and most suitable for the final decision","4:60":"Have you not turned your vision to those who declare that they believe in the revelations that have come to you and to those before you? Their wish is to come together for accountability in their disputes with Satan, though they were told to reject him. But Satan’s wish is to lead them astray","4:61":"When it is said to them, “Come to what God has revealed, and to the messenger,” you will see the hypocrites turn their faces from you in disgust","4:62":"O how they will be seized by misfortune because of the deeds which their hands have sent forth. Then they come to you swearing by God, “We meant no more than good-will and conciliation.”","4:63":"God knows what is in their hearts, so do not join them, but advise them, and speak to them a word to reach their very souls","4:64":"We did not send a messenger except to be followed in accordance with the will of God. If they had only, when they were unjust to themselves, come to you and asked God's forgiveness, and once the messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found God indeed Oft-Returning, the Merciful Redeemer","4:65":"But no, by the Guardian Evolver, they can have no faith, until they make you judge for all disputes among them, and find in their souls no resistance against your decisions, but instead accept them with the fullest conviction","4:66":"If We ordered them to sacrifice their lives or to leave their homes, very few of them would have done so. But if they had done what they were told, it would have been best for them, and would have gone furthest to strengthen their faith","4:67":"And We would then have given them, from our presence, a great reward","4:68":"And We would have shown them the straight way","4:69":"All who follow God and the messenger, are in the company of those on whom is the grace of God, the Prophets who teach, the sincere, the witnesses, and the righteous. What a beautiful fellowship","4:70":"Such is the bounty from God, and sufficient is it that God knows all","4:71":"O you who believe, take your precautions, and either go forward in groups or go forward all together","4:72":"There are certainly among you those who would stay behind. If a misfortune befalls you they say, “God favored us in that we were not present among them.”","4:73":"But if good fortune comes to you from God they would be sure to say, as if there had never been ties of affection between you and them, “Oh, I wish I had been with them, a great success would I have made of it.”","4:74":"Let those fight in the cause of God, who sell the life of the present for the hereafter. To him who fights in the cause of God, whether he is slain or is victorious, soon We will give him a reward of immense value","4:75":"And how could you refuse to fight in the cause of God and for those who lack power and are oppressed?

And those who do not believe, fight in the cause of wrong. So fight against the friends of Satan. Weak indeed is the scheme of Satan","4:77":"Have you not turned your vision to those told to hold back their hands, but to instead establish prayer and pay their zakat? When the order for fighting was issued to them, behold, a section of them feared people as, or even more than, they should have feared God. They said, “Our Lord, why have you ordered us to fight? Will you not grant us respite to our natural term?” Say, “Short is the enjoyment of the present. The hereafter is best for those who do right. And never will you be dealt with unjustly in the least","4:78":"“Wherever you are, death will find you.

However, whatever unnaturally harms you is from yourselves. We have sent you as a messenger to humanity, and enough is God for a witness","4:80":"He who obeys the messenger, has certainly obeyed God. However, if any turn away, We have not sent you to watch over them","4:81":"They have obedience on their lips, but when they leave you, a group of them thinks all night about things very different from what you tell them. However, God records their nightly plots. So keep clear of them and put your trust in God, and enough is God as a manager of affairs","4:82":"Do they not consider the Quran? Had it been from other than God, they would surely have found in it much discrepancy","4:83":"When there comes to them some matter concerning fear, they divulge it. If they had only referred it to the messenger, or to those given authority among them, the proper investigators would have proven it for them. Were it not for the grace and mercy of God to you, all but a few of you would have fallen into the clutches of Satan","4:84":"So fight in God's cause. You are responsible only for yourself. And rouse the believers. It may be that God will restrain the might of the unbelievers, for God is stronger in might and stronger in punishing","4:85":"Whoever recommends and helps a good cause becomes a partner in it. And whoever recommends and helps a harmful cause, shares in its burden. And God has power over all things","4:86":"When a greeting is offered to you, meet it with a greeting more courteous, or of equal courtesy. And God takes careful account of all things","4:87":"God, there is no god but Him. Indeed He will gather you together against the Day of Accountability, about which there is no doubt, and whose word can be truer than God's","4:88":"Why are you divided into two groups concerning the hypocrites? God has upset them for their deeds. Would you guide those whom God has thrown out of the way? For those whom God has thrown out of the way, never can you show him a way","4:89":"They only wish that you would not believe, like them, so that you would be on the same level as them. But do not take friends from their ranks until they go the way of God. But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever you find them, and take no allies from their ranks","4:90":"Except those who join a group with whom there is a treaty of peace, or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you and from fighting their own people. If God so pleased, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. Therefore, if they withdraw from you, and do not fight you, and send you peace, then God has opened no way for you to war against them","4:91":"Others you will find who wish to gain your confidence, as well as some from their people. But every time they are sent back to temptation, they succumb to it. If they do not withdraw from you, nor give you guarantees of peace, nor restrain their hands, then seize them and slay them wherever you find them. In their case, We have provided you with a clear argument against them","4:92":"Never should a believer kill a believer. But if it happens by mistake, compensation is due. If one kills a believer, it is ordained that he should free a believing slave, and pay compensation to the family of the deceased, unless they refuse it freely. If the deceased belonged to a people at war with you, and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave is enough. If he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance, compensation should be paid to his family, and a believing slave should be freed. For those who find this beyond their means, fast for two months straight, by way of repentance to God, for God has all knowledge, and all wisdom","4:93":"Whoever kills a believer intentionally, his reward is hell, to live in forever. And the punishment and the curse of God are upon him. And a dreadful penalty is prepared for him","4:94":"O you who believe, when you go abroad in the cause of God, observe carefully, and do not say to anyone who offers you a salutation, “You are not a believer.” They covet the perishable goods of this life. But with God are profits and goods abundant. You were like them yourselves until God conferred on you His favors. Therefore, carefully observe, for God is well aware of all that you do","4:95":"Not equal are those believers who sit at home and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of God with their goods and their persons. God has granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons, than to those who sit at home. To all has God promised good, but He favors those who strive and fight, above those who sit at home, with a special reward","4:96":"Ranks specially bestowed by Him, and forgiveness and mercy. For God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","4:97":"When angels take the souls of those who die harming their souls, they say, “In what condition were you in?” They will reply, “Weak and oppressed were we in the earth.” They say, “Was not the earth of God spacious enough for you to move yourselves away from wrong?” Such people will find their abode in hell, what a terrible place","4:98":"Except for those who are truly weak and oppressed. The men, women, and children who have neither means in their power, nor were they guided to the path","4:99":"For these, there is hope that God will forgive, for God removes sins and forgive again and again","4:100":"He who abandons his home in the cause of God, finds in the earth many places of refuge, wide and spacious.

When they finish their prostrations, let them take their position in the rear, and let the other group come up which has not yet prayed. And let them pray with you, taking all precaution, and bearing arms. The unbelievers wish, if you were negligent of your arms and your gear, to assault you in a single ambush. But there is no blame on you if you put away your arms, because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill, but take precaution for yourselves, for the unbelievers, God has prepared a crushing punishment","4:103":"When you finish prayer, remember God, standing, sitting down, or lying down on your sides.

So believe in God and His messengers, and say not “Trinity.” Desist, it will be better for you, for only God is God, the One, and Glory be to Him. Far exalted is He above having a son. To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth, and enough is God as a manager of affairs","4:172":"Christ does not fail to serve and worship God, nor do the angels, those who are nearest. Those who fail to worship Him are arrogant, He will gather them all to Himself","4:173":"But to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, He will give them their reward and more, out of His bounty.

Nor on the animals brought for sacrifice. Nor on the garlands that identify such animals. Nor on the people visiting the Sacred House, seeking the bounty and blessings of their Lord. And when you come out of pilgrim garb, you may hunt. But do not let the hatred of some people who shut you out of the Sacred Masjid, lead you to transgression. Help one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in harmful deeds and hatred.

The food of the people of the Book is permissible to you and yours is permissible to them, as are chaste women who are Believers, and chaste women among the people of the Book revealed before your time, if you give them their dowries, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret rendezvous. If anyone rejects faith, fruitless is his work, and in the hereafter, he will be in the ranks of those who are lost","5:6":"O you who believe, when you prepare for prayer, wash your faces, hands and arms to the elbows, wipe your heads and feet to the ankles.

But if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes from the offices of nature, or you have been intimate with women, and you find no water, then take for yourselves natural earth, and wash your faces and hands with it.

They change the words from their places and forget a good part of the message that was sent to them. And you will not cease to find them, except a few, relying on lies. But forgive them, and overlook it, for God loves those who are kind","5:14":"Also from those who said, \"Certainly we are Christians,\" We took a covenant. But they forgot a good part of the message that was sent to them. So we estranged them with enmity and hatred between one another, until the Day of Accountability. And soon God will show them what it is they have done","5:15":"O people of the Book, there has come to you Our messenger revealing to you much of that which you used to hide in the Book, and passing over much.

Their penalty will be one that endures","5:38":"As well as the male and female thief. So cut off their hands.

They take the words out of context. They say, “If you are given this, take it, but if not, beware.” If for anyone a trial is intended by God, you have no authority in the least for him against God.

Wrong indeed are the things that they do","5:63":"Why do the rabbis and the doctors of law not discourage them from their saying sinful words, and from involvement in things forbidden? Wrong indeed are their deeds","5:64":"Jews say, “God's hands are tied.” Their hands are tied, and they are cursed for what they utter. No, both His hands are wide open. He gives as He pleases, but the revelation that comes to you from God increases in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy.

If you did not, you would not have fulfilled His mission. God will defend you from the people, for God does not guide those who do not believe","5:68":"Say, “O people of the Book, you have no grounds to stand upon unless you stand fast by the Law, the gospel, and all the revelation that has come to you from your Lord.” It is the revelation that comes to you from your Lord which increases in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blaspheme. But do not worry about the people without faith","5:69":"Those who believe, those who are Jews, Sabaeans, Christians, and any who believe in God and the Last Day and work righteousness, on them will be no fear, nor shall they grieve","5:70":"We took the covenant of the Children of Israel and sent them messengers. Every time there came to them a messenger with what they did not desire, they called some of them impostors, and some they slay","5:71":"They thought there would be no trial or punishment, so they became blind and deaf. Still God turned to them, but again, many of them became blind and deaf, but God sees well all that they do","5:72":"They do blaspheme who say, “God is Christ the son of Mary.” But what Christ said was, “O Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord.” Whoever joins other gods with God, He will forbid him the garden, and the fire will be his abode. For the wrongdoers there will be no one to help","5:73":"They do blaspheme who say, “God is one of three in a trinity,” for there is no god except the one God. If they do not desist from these words, indeed a terrible penalty will befall the blasphemers among them","5:74":"Why do they not turn to God and seek His forgiveness? For God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","5:75":"Christ the son of Mary was no more than a messenger. Many were the messengers who passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They both had to eat their food. See how God makes His signs clear to them, yet see in what ways they are deluded away from the truth","5:76":"Say, “Will you worship besides God something that has power neither to harm nor benefit you? But God, He hears and knows all things.”","5:77":"Say, “O people of the Book, do not go to extremes in your religions, other than in truth. Nor follow the vain desires of people who went wrong in times gone by, who misled many and strayed from the balanced way.”","5:78":"Condemnation was pronounced on those among the Children of Israel who rejected faith, by the tongue of David and of Jesus the son of Mary, because they did not follow them and persisted in excesses","5:79":"Nor did they discourage one another the immorality which they committed. Wrong indeed were the things they did","5:80":"You see many of them turning in friendship to the unbelievers. Wrong indeed is that which their souls have sent forward before them. God's punishment is on them, and they will live in torment","5:81":"If only they had believed in God, in the messenger, and in what is revealed to him, never would they have taken them for friends and protectors, but many of them are rebellious wrongdoers","5:82":"Strongest among people in opposition to the believers will you find among the Jews and pagans. And alongside those believers in devotion will you find those who say, “We are Christians,” because among these are those devoted to learning and those who are in service to humanity, and they are not arrogant. 82 (End of Part)","5:83":"And when they listen to the revelation received by the messenger, you will see their eyes overflowing with tears, for they recognize the truth. They pray, “Our Lord, we believe, write us down among those who bear witness","5:84":"“What cause do we have not to believe in God and the truth that has come to us, seeing that we long for our Lord to admit us to the company of the righteous?”","5:85":"And for this prayer has God rewarded them with gardens through which rivers flow. This is their eternal home. Such is the reward of those who do right","5:86":"But those who do not believe and deny Our signs, they will be companions of hellfire","5:87":"O you who believe, do not make impermissible good things that God has made permissible for you. However do not overindulge, for God does not love those who overindulge","5:88":"Eat of the things which God has provided for you, permissible and healthy, but be aware of God, in Whom you believe","5:89":"God will not call you to account for your casual promises, but He will call you to account for your contractual obligations. For atonement, feed ten indigent people on a scale of the average for your families, or clothe them, or free a slave. If that is beyond your means, fast for three days, that redeems the promises you have made. But keep your promises. God makes clear to you His signs so that you may be grateful","5:90":"O you who believe, intoxicants and gambling, dedication of stones and divination by arrows is the harmful work of Satan. Avoid such harm that you may flourish","5:91":"Satan’s plan is to incite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and to keep you from the remembrance of God and from prayer. Will you not then abstain","5:92":"Follow God, follow the messenger, and be cautious. If you turn back, know that it is only Our messenger’s duty to proclaim the message in the clearest manner","5:93":"On those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, there is no blame for what they were fed, when they guard themselves from harm, believe and do deeds of righteousness. Again, guard themselves from harm and believe. Again, guard themselves from harm and do good deeds. For God loves those who do right","5:94":"O you who believe, God challenges you concerning game well within reach of your hands and weaponry, that He may make evident those who fear Him, although He is Unseen. Any who transgress thereafter will have a terrible penalty","5:95":"O you who believe, do not kill game while in pilgrim garb. If any of you does so intentionally, the compensation is an offering brought to the Kaaba of a domestic animal equivalent to the one he killed, as adjudged by two just people among you, or in exchange, the feeding of the indigent, or its equivalent in fasts, that he may taste of the penalty of his deed. God forgives what has passed. For retribution God will exact from him the penalty, for God is Exalted, Lord of retribution","5:96":"Permissible to you is the pursuit of water-game and its use for food for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel with you. But forbidden is the pursuit of land-game as long as you are in pilgrim garb. And be conscious of God, to Whom you will be gathered back","5:97":"God made the Kaaba, the Sacred House, a sanctuary for people, and also the sacred months, the animals for offerings, and the garlands that identify them, that you may know that God has knowledge of what is in the heavens and on earth, and that God is well acquainted with all things","5:98":"Know that God is strict in punishment and that God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","5:99":"The Messenger’s duty is only to proclaim the message, but God knows all that you reveal and conceal","5:100":"Say, “Not equal are things that are harmful and things that are good, even though the abundance of the harmful may dazzle you. So be conscious of God, O you who understand, that you may flourish.”","5:101":"O you who believe, do not ask questions about things which if made plain to you, may cause you problems. But if you ask about things when the Quran is being revealed, they will be made plain to you, and God will forgive, because God is Oft-Forgiving, Most Understanding","5:102":"Some people before you asked such questions, and consequently lost their faith","5:103":"It was not God who instituted superstitions like a slit-ear she-camel, or a she-camel let loose for free pasture, or idol sacrifices for twin-births in animals, or stallion-camels freed from work. Blasphemers invent a lie against God, but most of them lack wisdom","5:104":"When it is said to them, “Come to what God has revealed, come to the messenger. They say, “Enough for us are the ways we found our fathers following.” What, even though their fathers were void of knowledge and guidance","5:105":"O you who believe, guard your souls. If you follow guidance, no harm can come to you from those who stray. The goal of you all is to God. He will show you the truth of all that you do","5:106":"O you who believe, when death approaches any of you, take witnesses among yourselves when making wills, take two just people from your brothers, or two others from outside if you are journeying through the earth and the chance of death befalls you. If you doubt their words, keep them both after prayer, and let them both swear by God, “We do not want any worldly gain, even though the beneficiary is a near relative. We will not hide the proof before God, and if we do, then behold, the sin is on us.”","5:107":"But if it becomes known that these two were guilty of this sin, let two others stand forth in their place, those nearest in family from among those who claim a lawful right. Let them swear by God that, “We affirm that our witness is truer than that of those two, and that we have not trespassed beyond the truth. If we did, behold, the harm is on us.”","5:108":"That is most suitable, that they may give the evidence in its true form, or else they should fear that other testimonies would be taken over their testimony. So be conscious of God, and listen, for God does not guide a rebellious people","5:109":"One day God will gather the messengers together and ask, “What was the response you received?” They will say, “We cannot know. It is You who fully know all that is hidden.”","5:110":"Then God will say, “O Jesus the son of Mary, remember My favor to you and to your mother. Behold, I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit, so that you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity. Behold, I taught you the Book and the Wisdom, the Law and the gospel. And behold, you make out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My permission, and you breathe into it and it becomes a real bird, by My permission, and you heal those born blind, and the lepers, by My permission. And behold, you bring forth the dead by My permission. And behold, I kept the Children of Israel from you when you showed them the clear signs, and the unbelievers among them said, ‘This is nothing but obvious deception.’ ”","5:111":"And behold, I inspired the Disciples to have faith in My messenger and Me. They said, “We have faith, bear witness that we are Muslims.”","5:112":"Behold, the Disciples said, “O Jesus the son of Mary, can your Lord send down to us a table set from heaven?” Jesus said, “Be regardful of God, if you are believers.”","5:113":"They said, “We only wish to eat of it and satisfy our hearts, and to know that you have indeed told us the truth, and that we may be witnesses to a miracle.”","5:114":"Said Jesus the son of Mary, “O God, our Guardian Evolver, send us from heaven a table set, that there may be for us, for the first and the last of us, a solemn celebration and a sign from You, and provide for our sustenance, for you are the Best Sustainer.”","5:115":"God said, “I will send it down to you, but if any of you after that resists faith, I will punish him with a penalty such as I have not inflicted on anyone among all peoples.”","5:116":"And behold, God will say, “O Jesus the son of Mary, did you say to the people, worship me and my mother as gods?” He will say, “Glory to You, never could I say what I had no right to say. Had I said such a thing, you would indeed have known it. You know what is in my heart, though I know not what is in Yours, for You know all that is hidden.”","5:117":"“Never did I say to them anything except what You asked me to say, namely, ‘worship God, my Lord and your Lord’, and I was a witness over them while I lived among them. When You raised me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a witness to all things","5:118":"“If You punish them, they are Your servants. If You forgive them, You are the Exalted in Power, the Wise.”","5:119":"God will say, “This is a day on which the truthful will profit from their truthfulness. Theirs are gardens with rivers flowing beneath, their eternal home. God well pleased with them, and they with God. That is the great salvation","5:120":"To God belongs the control of the heavens and the earth, and all that is in it, and it is He Who has power over all things","6:1":"Praise be to God, Who created the heavens and the earth, and made the darkness and the light. Yet, those who do not believe hold others as equal with their Guardian Evolver","6:2":"He Who created you from clay, and then decreed a stated term for you, and there is in His presence another determined term, yet you doubt it within yourselves","6:3":"And He is God in the heavens and on earth. He knows what you hide, and what you reveal, and He knows that which you earn","6:4":"But never did even one of the signs of their Lord reach them, except that they turned away from it","6:5":"And now they reject the truth when it reaches them, but soon they will learn the reality of what they used to mock","6:6":"Do they not see how many of those before them We destroyed? Generations have We established on the earth with the type of strength which We have not given to you. For whom We poured out rain from the skies in abundance, and gave streams flowing beneath them. Yet for their sins, We caused them to perish, and produced in their wake new generations","6:7":"If We had sent to you writing on parchment, so that they could touch it with their hands, the unbelievers would have been sure to say, “This is nothing but obvious magic.”","6:8":"They say, “Why is an angel not sent down to him?” If We sent down an angel, the matter would have been settled at once, and no discovery would have been possible for them","6:9":"And if We had sent an angel, We would have sent it in an image of a human being. And We would have then further confused them in a matter which they were already confused","6:10":"Mocked were messengers before you, but the very thing they mocked hemmed them in","6:11":"Say, “Travel through the earth to see what the end of those who rejected truth was.”","6:12":"Say, “Who does all that is in the heaven and the earth belong to?” Say, “To God.” And He has decreed for Himself mercy. Indeed, He will gather you together for the Day of Accountability, there is no doubt whatsoever. It is those who have lost themselves that will not believe","6:13":"To Him belongs all that dwells in the night and the day, for He is the One Who hears and knows all things.”","6:14":"Say, “Shall I take for my protector any other than God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? It is He Who feeds, but is not fed.” Say, “No, I am asked to be the first of those who bow to God, so do not be people who join gods with God.”","6:15":"Say, “I would, if I did not follow my Guardian Evolver, indeed have fear of the penalty of a mighty day","6:16":"“On that day, if the penalty is averted from any, it is due to God's mercy, and that would be salvation, and the fulfillment of all desire","6:17":"“If God touches you with affliction, none can remove it but Him. If He touches you with happiness, He has power over all things","6:18":"“He is the Irresistible, watching from above His worshippers, and He is the Wise, acquainted with all things.”","6:19":"Say, “What thing is most weighty in evidence?” Say, “God is witness between you and me, that this Quran has been revealed to me by inspiration, that I may warn you and all whom it reaches. Can you bear witness that besides God there is another god?” Say, “No, I cannot bear witness.” Say, “In truth He is the one God, and I certainly am free of your joining others with Him.”","6:20":"Those to whom We have given the Book, know this as they know their own sons. Those who have lost their own souls, refuse therefore to believe","6:21":"Who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against God or rejects His signs? Indeed the wrongdoers will never prosper","6:22":"One day We will gather them all together. We will say to those who ascribed partners to Us, “Where are the partners whom you spoke of?”","6:23":"There will then be no plea for them except to say, “By God Our Lord, we were not those who joined gods with God.”","6:24":"Behold, how they lie against their own souls. But that which they invented will leave them","6:25":"Some listen to you, but We have thrown veils over their hearts, so they understand it not, and deafness is in their ears. If they saw each and every one of the signs, they would not believe in them, so much so, that when they come to you, they dispute with you. The unbelievers say, “These are nothing but tales of the ancient.”","6:26":"They keep others away from it, and themselves they keep away from it, but they only destroy themselves, but they perceive it not","6:27":"If you could only see when they are confronted with the fire, they will say, “If only we were sent back. Then we would not reject the signs of Our Lord, but would be among those who believe.”","6:28":"Yes, in them will become manifest, that which before they concealed. But if they were returned, they would certainly relapse to the things they were forbidden to do, for they are indeed liars","6:29":"And they say, “There is nothing except our life on this earth, and never will we be raised up again.”","6:30":"If you could only see when they are confronted by their Lord, He will say, “Is this not the truth?” They will say, “Yes, by our Lord.” He will say, “Taste then the penalty, because you rejected faith.”","6:31":"Lost indeed are they who treat as falsehood, the fact that they must meet God, until all of a sudden, the Hour is on them and they say, “Woe to us, that we did not consider it.” For they bear their burdens on their backs, and miserable indeed are the burdens that they bear","6:32":"What is the life of the present but play and entertainment? Best is the home in the hereafter, for those who are righteous. Will you not then understand","6:33":"Indeed We know the grief that their words cause you. It is not you that they reject, it is the signs of God which the wicked condemn","6:34":"Rejected were the messengers before you. With patience and constancy they bore their rejection and their wrongs, until Our aid reached them. None can alter the words of God. You have already received some account of those messengers","6:35":"Their aversion is hard on your mind, yet if you were able to seek a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the skies and bring them a sign, no good would it be. If it were God's will, He could gather them to true guidance. So do not be among those who are swayed by ignorance","6:36":"Those who listen, surely will accept it, but the dead, God will raise them up, and then they will turn to Him","6:37":"They say, “Why is a sign not sent down to him from his Guardian Evolver?” Say, “God certainly has power to send down a sign, but most of them do not use reason.”","6:38":"There is not an animal on the earth nor a being that flies on its wings, that does not form communities like you. Nothing have We omitted from the Book, and they will be gathered to their Lord in the end","6:39":"Those who reject our signs are deaf and dumb, in the middle of darkness. And whom God wills, He leaves to wander. And whom He wills, He places on the way that is straight","6:40":"Say, “Do you think that if there came upon you the punishment of God or the Hour, that you would then call upon other than God? Reply if you are truthful","6:41":"“No, you would call on Him. And if it is His will, He would remove the distress which caused your call to Him, and you would forget that which you join with Him.”","6:42":"Before you We sent much to many nations. And We afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity that they may experience virtue","6:43":"When the suffering reached them from Us, why then did they not learn virtue? On the contrary, their hearts became hardened, and Satan made their acts seem alluring to them","6:44":"But when they forgot the warning they received, We opened to them the gates of all things, until in the middle of their enjoyment of Our gifts, all of a sudden, We called them to account, and then, they were plunged into despair","6:45":"Of the wrongdoers, the last remnant was cut off. Praise God, the Guardian Evolver of all the worlds","6:46":"Say, “Do you think that if God took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed up your hearts, which god other than God, could restore them to you?” See how We explain the signs by various signs? And still they turn away","6:47":"Say, “Do you think that if the punishment of God comes to you, whether suddenly or openly, will any be caused to perish except those who do wrong","6:48":"We send the messengers only to give good news and to warn. So those who believe and mend their lives, upon them will be no fear, nor shall they grieve","6:49":"But those who reject Our signs, them will punishment touch, because they ceased not from transgressing","6:50":"Say, “I do not tell you that with me are the treasures of God, nor do I know what is hidden, nor do I tell you that I am an angel. I only follow what is revealed to me.” Say, “Can the blind be held equal to the seeing?” Will you not then consider","6:51":"Give this warning to those who fear that they will be brought before their Guardian Evolver. Except for Him, they will have no protector or intercessor to guard them","6:52":"Do not send away those who call on their Guardian Evolver morning and evening, seeking His face. In no way are you accountable for them, and in no way are they accountable for you, but you should not turn them away and become one of the unjust","6:53":"So We tried some of them by comparison with others so that they would say, “Is it these then who God has favored from among us?” Does God not know best those who are grateful","6:54":"When those who believe come to you with Our signs say, “Peace be upon you.” And remember that your Lord has inscribed for Himself mercy. Indeed, if any of you did wrong in ignorance, and thereafter repented, and amend their conduct, then He is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","6:55":"And the reason why We explain the signs in detail is so the ways of the corrupt will be exposed","6:56":"Say, “I am forbidden to worship those other than God that you call upon.” Say, “I will not follow your vain desires. If I did, I would stray from the path, and not be of the company of those who receive guidance.”","6:57":"Say, “For me, I follow guidance from my Lord, but you reject Him. What you would see hastened is not in my power. The command rests with none but God. He declares the truth, and He is the best of judges.”","6:58":"Say, “If what you would see hastened were in my power, the matter would be settled at once between you and me, but God knows best those who do wrong.”","6:59":"With Him are the keys of the unseen, the secrets that none know but He. He knows what there is on the earth and in the sea. Not a leaf falls except with His knowledge. There is not a seed in the darkness of the earth, nor anything fresh nor dry, that is not in a clear record","6:60":"It is He Who takes your souls by night, and has knowledge of all that you have done by day. And by day, He raises you up again, that a term appointed is fulfilled. In the end, to Him will be your return, and then will He show you the truth of all that you did","6:61":"He is the Irresistible, high above His worshippers, and He sets guardians over you. Then when death approaches one of you, Our angels take her soul, and they never fail in their duty","6:62":"Then they are returned to God, their Protector, the Reality. Is not His the command? And He is the swiftest in taking account","6:63":"Say, “Who is it that delivers you from the dark recesses of land and sea, when you call upon Him in humility and with fear, ‘If He would only deliver us from this, then we will truly show our gratitude.’ ”","6:64":"Say, “It is God that delivers you from these and all other distresses, yet you worship false gods.”","6:65":"Say, “He has power to send calamities on you, from above and below. Or to cover you with confusion and strife, giving you a taste of mutual vengeance, each from the other.” See how We explain the signs, that they may understand","6:66":"But your people reject this, though it is the truth. Say, “I do not have the responsibility for arranging your affairs","6:67":"“For every message is a limit of time, and soon will you know it.”","6:68":"When you see people engaged in vain talk about Our signs, ignore them until they talk of something different. If Satan makes you forget, then after remembering, do not sit in the company of those who do wrong","6:69":"No responsibility falls on the righteous, except that they are to remind them, so that they may be regardful","6:70":"Leave those alone who take their religion to be play and entertainment, and are deceived by the life of the present. But proclaim this, “That every soul delivers itself to ruin by its own deeds. It will find for itself no protector nor intercessor except God. If they offered any ransom, none will be accepted. Such is the end of those who deliver themselves to ruin by their own acts. They will have for drink boiling water, for a punishment most terrible, for they persisted in rejecting God.”","6:71":"Say, \"Shall we indeed call on others besides God, call on things that can do us neither good nor harm? And should we turn on our heels after receiving guidance from God, like one whom Satan has made into a fool, wandering lost through the earth, with his friends calling, ‘come to us’, vainly guiding him to the path.” Say, “God's guidance is the guidance, and we have been directed to submit ourselves to the Guardian Evolver of the cosmos","6:72":"“To establish prayer and to be conscious of God, for it is to Him Who we will be gathered together.”","6:73":"It is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth. The day He says “Be”, behold, it is. His word is the truth. His will is the control, the day the trumpet will be blown. He knows the unknown, as well as that which is apparent, for He is the Wise, well acquainted with all things","6:74":"Abraham said to his father Azar, “Do you take idols for gods? Indeed I see that you and your people are clearly error.”","6:75":"We also showed Abraham the power and the laws of the heavens and the earth, that he might have certainty","6:76":"When the night spread over him, He saw a star and said, “This is my Lord.” But when it set he said, “I love not those that set.”","6:77":"When he saw the Moon rising in splendor he said, “This is my Lord.” But when the Moon set he said, “Unless my Lord guides me, I will surely be among those who are lost.”","6:78":"When he saw the Sun rising in splendor he said, “This is my Lord, this is the greatest of all.” But when the Sun set he said, “O my people, I am indeed free from your giving partners to God","6:79":"“For me, I have set my face firmly and truly towards He Who created the heavens and the earth, and never will I give partners to God.”","6:80":"His people argued with him and he said, “You argue with me about God, when He has guided me? I do not fear that which you associate with God, unless my Lord wills. My Guardian Evolver comprehends and delivers in His knowledge of all things. Will you then not be advised","6:81":"“How could I fear those you associate with God, when you do not fear giving partners to God without permission having been given to you? Which of the two groups has more right to security? Tell me if you know","6:82":"“It is those who believe and do not confuse their beliefs with wrong who are truly secure, for they are rightly guided.”","6:83":"That was the reasoning about Us which We gave to Abraham for his people. We raise whom We will, degree after degree, for your Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge","6:84":"We gave him Isaac and Jacob. All were guided. And before him, We guided Noah, and among his progeny, David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. We reward those who do right","6:85":"And Zachariah and Yahya, and Jesus and Elias, are all in the ranks of the righteous","6:86":"And Ishmael and Elisha, Jonas and Lot, and to all We gave favor above the nations","6:87":"And from their parents, progeny, and siblings, We chose them, and we guided them to a straight way","6:88":"This is the guidance of God. He gives that guidance to whom He pleases among His worshippers. If they were to join other gods with Him, then all that they did would be in vain","6:89":"These were those to whom We gave the Book, authority, and the prophetic office. If they reject them, behold, We will entrust their charge to a new people who will not reject them","6:90":"These received God's guidance. As for the guidance they received they say, “No reward do I ask of you for this. This is no less than a message to all the worlds.”","6:91":"No just estimate of God do they make when they say, “God reveals nothing to a human being.” Say, “Who then sent down the Book that Moses brought, a light and guidance to humanity which you made into scrolls for show, while you conceal much of what is in it, and that which you were taught which you knew not, neither you nor your ancestors?” Say, “God.” Then leave them to plunge in vain discourse and to be trifling","6:92":"And this is a book that We have sent down, bringing blessings and reflecting the truth of what came before it, so that you might warn the Mother of Cities, and all around it. Those who believe in the hereafter, believe in this, and are constant in remembering their prayers","6:93":"Who can do more wrong than one who invents a lie against God or says, “I have received inspiration,” when he has received none, or who says, “I can reveal the like of what God has revealed.” If you could only see how the wrong-doers fare in the flood of confusion at death. The angels stretch out their hands saying, “Yield up your souls, this day will you receive your reward, a penalty of shame, because you used to tell lies against God, and sarcastically reject His signs.”","6:94":"“And behold, you come to us bare and alone, as We created you the first time. You have left behind you, all that We gave to you. We do not see with you your intercessors whom you thought to be partners in your affairs. So now, all relations between you have been cut off, and your desires have left you lost.”","6:95":"It is God Who causes the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout. He causes the living to issue from the dead, and He causes the dead to issue from the living. That is God, so how are you deluded from the truth","6:96":"He cleaves the daybreak. He makes the night for rest and tranquility, and the Sun and Moon for telling time. Such is His judgment and ordering, the Exalted in Power, the Knower of all things","6:97":"It is He Who has made the stars for you, that you may guide yourselves, with their help, through the dark spaces of land and sea. We detail Our signs for people who think","6:98":"It is He Who has produced you from a single soul, in a place of sojourn and a place of departure. We detail Our signs for people who understand","6:99":"It is He Who sends down rain from the skies. With it, We produce vegetation of all kinds. From some We produce green crops, out of which We produce grain heaped up. Out of the date palm and its sheaths, come clusters of dates hanging low and near, and gardens of grapes, and olives, and pomegranates, each similar yet different. When they begin to bear fruit, look at the fruit and the ripeness of it. Behold, in these are signs for people who believe","6:100":"Yet they make the jinn equal with God, though God did create the jinn. And they falsely, having no knowledge, attribute to Him sons and daughters. Praise and glory be to Him, for He is above what they attribute to Him","6:101":"He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have a son without a female companion? He created all things, and He has full knowledge of all things","6:102":"That is God, your Guardian Evolver, there is no god but He, the Creator of all things. So worship Him, and He has power to manage all affairs","6:103":"No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. He is above comprehension, yet comprehends all things","6:104":"“Now there has come to you, from your Lord, proof. If any choose to see, it will be for their own self, if any choose to be blind, it will be against their own self. I am not here to watch over your doings.”","6:105":"Thus we explain the signs that they may say, “You have taught us diligently,” and that We may make the matter clear to those who know","6:106":"Follow what you are taught by inspiration from your Lord. There is no god but He. And turn away from those who join gods with God","6:107":"If it had been in God's plan, they would not have taken false gods. But We did not make you one to watch over their doings, nor are you set over them to manage their affairs","6:108":"Do not criticize those whom they call on besides God, or they will, out of spite, criticize God, out of ignorance. We have made pleasing to each people, their doings. In the end, they will return to their Lord, and We will then tell them the truth of all that they did","6:109":"They swear their strongest promise by God, that if a sign came to them, they would believe. Say, “Certainly the signs are in the power of God.” But what will make you realize that even if signs came, they would not believe","6:110":"We will turn their hearts and their eyes, even though they refused to believe in it the first time. We will leave them in their trespasses to wander in distraction. 110 (End of Part)","6:111":"Even if We sent to them angels, and the dead spoke to them, and We gathered all things before their very eyes, they are not ones to believe, unless it is in God's plan, but most of them ignore this","6:112":"We made enemies for every messenger from wrong-doers among humans and jinn, inspiring each other with flowery discourse by way of deception. If your Guardian Evolver had so willed, they would not have done it. So leave them and what they fabricate","6:113":"Let their hearts incline to it, those who have no faith in the hereafter. Let them enjoy it, and let them earn from it what they will","6:114":"Say, “Shall I look for a judge other than God, when it is He Who has sent to you the Book explained in detail?” They know full well to whom We have given the Book, and that it has been sent down from your Lord in truth. So never be of those who doubt","6:115":"The word of your Lord finds its fulfillment in truth and in justice. None can change His words, for He is the One Who hears and knows them all","6:116":"Were you to follow the common run of those on earth, they would lead you from the way of God. They follow nothing but speculation, they do nothing but lie","6:117":"Your Lord knows best who strays from His way, and He knows best who receives His guidance","6:118":"So eat of that on which God's name has been pronounced, if you have faith in His verses","6:119":"Why should you not eat of that on which God's name has been pronounced when He has explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you, except when forced by necessity? Indeed many stray by their appetites unchecked by knowledge. Your Lord knows best those who transgress","6:120":"Avoid harmful deeds, open or secret. Those who earn sin will get due reward for their earnings","6:121":"Do not eat of that on which God's name has not been pronounced. That would be impiety. But the devils inspire their friends to contend with you. If you were to follow them, you would indeed be pagans","6:122":"Can he who was dead, to whom We gave life and light, with which he can walk among people, be like him who is in the depths of darkness, from which he can never come out? So to those without faith, their deeds seem pleasing","6:123":"And We have placed in every great city, those who are corrupt, to conspire therein. But they only conspire against their own selves, though they realize it not","6:124":"When there comes to them a sign they say, “We will not believe until we receive one like those received by God's messengers.” God knows best where to carry out His mission. Soon the corrupt will be overtaken by humiliation before God, and a severe punishment for all their schemes","6:125":"Those whom God wills to guide, He opens their heart to Al-Islam. Those whom He wills to leave straying, He makes their heart closed and constricted, as if they had to climb up to the skies. And God heaps punishment on those who refuse to believe","6:126":"This is the way of your Lord, leading straight. We have detailed the signs for those who take advice","6:127":"For them will be a home of peace in the presence of their Lord. He will be their Friend, because they practiced righteousness","6:128":"One day He will gather them all together and say, “O you assembly of jinn, much did you take from humanity.” Their friends among humanity will say, “Our Guardian Evolver, we made profit from each other, but we reached our term which You appointed for us.” He will say, “The fire will be your dwelling-place, you will dwell there forever, except as God wills.” For your Lord is full of wisdom and knowledge","6:129":"So we make the wrongdoers turn to each other because of what they earn","6:130":"“O you assembly of jinn and humans, did there not come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My signs, and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours?” They will say, “We bear witness against ourselves.” The life of the present deceived them. So against themselves will they bear witness that they rejected faith","6:131":"For this, your Lord would not destroy them for their wrongdoing, or the peoples’ houses, while their occupants were unwarned","6:132":"To all are degrees according to their deeds, for your Guardian Evolver is not unmindful of anything they do","6:133":"Your Lord is self-sufficient, full of mercy. If it were His will, He could destroy you, and in your place appoint whom He wills as your successors, as He raised you up as successors of others","6:134":"All that has been promised to you will happen, and you cannot stop it","6:135":"Say, “O my people, do whatever you can, I will do what I can. Soon you will know who it is whose end will be in the hereafter. Indeed the wrong-doers will not succeed.”","6:136":"Out of what God has produced in abundance in land and in livestock, they assigned Him a share. They say according to their desires, “This is for God, and this for our partners.” But the share of their partners does not reach God, while the share of God reaches their partners. Terrible is their assignment","6:137":"And in the eyes of most of the pagans, their partners made alluring the slaughter of their children, in order to lead them to their own destruction, and cause confusion in their religion. If God had willed, they would not have done so, but leave them alone, them and their fabrications","6:138":"And they say that such and such livestock and crops are taboo, and none should eat of them except those whom, so they say, We wish. Further, there are livestock forbidden to burden, and livestock on which the name of God is not to be pronounced, all created against God's name. Soon He will repay them for their creations","6:139":"They say, “What is in the wombs of such and such livestock is specially reserved for our men, and forbidden for our women. But if it is still-born, then all may partake.” For their attributing superstitions to God, He will soon punish them, for He is full of wisdom and knowledge","6:140":"Lost are those who kill their children out of ignorance, and forbid food that God has provided for them, inventing lies against God. They have indeed gone astray and took no guidance","6:141":"It is He Who produces gardens with trellises and without, dates and land with produce of all kind, and olives and pomegranates, similar yet different. Eat of its fruit in their season, but render the dues that are proper on the day that the harvest is gathered, and waste not by excess, for God loves not the wasters","6:142":"Of the livestock, there are some for work and some for meat. Eat what God has provided for you, and do not follow the footsteps of Satan, for he is to you a sworn enemy","6:143":"Take eight head of livestock in four pairs, of sheep a pair, and of goats a pair. Say, “Has He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or that which the wombs of the two females enclose? Tell me with certainty if you are truthful.”","6:144":"Of camels a pair, and oxen a pair. Say, “Has He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or that which the wombs of the two females enclose? Were you present when God commanded such a thing? But who does more wrong than one who invents a lie against God, to lead astray people without knowledge? God does not guide the people who do wrong","6:145":"Say, “I do not find in the message I received by inspiration anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it is animals found dead, or blood poured out, or the flesh of swine, for it is an abomination, or what is unclean, or that on which a name has been invoked other than God.” But if a person is forced by necessity, with neither outright rejecting, nor transgressing due limits, your Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","6:146":"For those who were Jewish, We made forbidden every animal with an undivided hoof. And We made forbidden to them fat of the ox and the sheep, except what adheres to their backs or their entrails, or what is mixed up with bone. That is their reward for their outright rejection, for indeed We are truthful","6:147":"If they accuse you of falsehood say, “Your Lord is full of mercy All-Embracing. But from guilty people, never will His punishment be turned back.”","6:148":"Those who give partners to God will say, “If God had wished, we would not have given partners to Him, nor would our fathers, nor should we have had any taboos,” as did their fathers argue falsely, until they tasted Our punishment. Say, “Have you any proof? If so, bring it before us. You follow nothing but speculation. You do nothing but lie.”","6:149":"Say, “With God is the argument that reaches home. If it had been His will, He could indeed have guided you all.”","6:150":"Say, “Bring forward your witnesses to prove that God did prohibit this.” If they bring such witnesses, be not among them, nor follow the vain desires of those who treat our signs as falsehood, and those who do not believe in the hereafter, for they hold others as equal with their Guardian Evolver.”","6:151":"Say, “Come, I will rehearse what God has made sacred. Join not anything as equal with Him, be good to your parents, and do not kill your children for fear of want. We care for you and for them. Come not near shameful deeds, whether open or secret, do not take life that God has made sacred, except by way of justice and law. This is what He commands you, that you may learn wisdom","6:152":"And do not come near to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength, and give measure and weight with justice. No burden do We place on any soul except that which it can bear. Whenever you speak, speak justly, even if a near relative is concerned, and fulfill the covenant of God. This He recommended to you, that you may remember","6:153":"Indeed this is My path leading straight, so follow it. Do not follow other paths that will separate you from His way, this does He recommend to you, that you may be righteous","6:154":"Moreover, We gave Moses the Book, completing Our favor to those who wish to do right, and explaining all things in detail, and a guide and a mercy, that they might believe in the meeting with their Lord","6:155":"And this is a book which We have revealed as a blessing. So follow it and be righteous, that you may receive mercy","6:156":"Lest you should say, “The book was sent down to two peoples before us, and for our part, we remained unacquainted with all that they learned from their study.”","6:157":"Or lest you should say, “If the Book had only been sent down to us, we would have followed its guidance better than they.” Now there has come to you a clear book from your Lord, and a guide and a mercy. Then who could do more wrong than one who rejects God's signs, and turns away from it? In good time, We will repay those who turn away from Our signs, with a dreadful penalty, for their turning away","6:158":"Are they waiting to see if the angels will come to them, or your Lord Himself, or some of the signs of your Lord? The day that some of the signs of your Lord will come, no good will it do for one to believe in them then, if he believed not before, nor earned righteousness through his faith. Say, “Wait, we too are waiting.”","6:159":"As for those who divide their religion and break up into sects, you are not responsible for any of their internal strife. Their affair is with God. In the end, He will tell them the truth of all that they did","6:160":"Whoever does right will have ten times as much to his credit. Whoever does wrong will only be rewarded according to their wrong. No wrong will be done to them","6:161":"Say, “Indeed, my Lord has guided me to a way that is straight, and a way that is right, the way of Abraham, the intelligent in faith, and he did not join gods with God.”","6:162":"Say, “Truly my prayer and my service of sacrifice, my life and my death, are for God, the Guardian Evolver of all the worlds","6:163":"“He has no partner. This am I asked, and I am the first of those who bow to His will.”","6:164":"Say, “Shall I seek for my Lord other than God, when He is the Guardian Evolver of all things? Every soul draws the reward of its acts on none but itself. No bearer of burden can bear the burden of another. Your goal in the end is to God. He will tell you the truth of the things you disputed.”","6:165":"It is He Who has made you caretakers and inheritors of the earth. He has raised you in ranks, some above others, that He may try you in the gifts He has given you. And your Lord is quick in punishment, yet He is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","7:1":"Alif, Laam, Miim, Saad","7:2":"A book revealed to you, so let your heart be oppressed no more by any difficulty from it, and with it, advise and teach","7:3":"Follow the revelation given to you from your Guardian Evolver, and do not follow as friends or protectors others before Him. But little is it that you remember","7:4":"How many towns have We caused to perish? Our punishment took them all of a sudden by night, or while they slept during their afternoon rest","7:5":"When Our punishment took them, no cry did they utter but this, “Indeed we did wrong.”","7:6":"Then will we question those to whom Our message was sent and those by whom We sent it","7:7":"And indeed, We will retell their whole story with certainty, for We were never absent","7:8":"The balance that day will be true. Those whose scale will be heavy will flourish","7:9":"Those whose scale will be light, their souls will be in perdition, because they treated Our signs wrongfully","7:10":"It is We Who have placed you with authority on earth, and provided you with means for the fulfillment of your life. Little is the thanks that you give","7:11":"It is We Who created you and gave you shape, then We asked the angels to bow down to Adam, and they bowed down, but not Lucifer. He refused to be of those who bowed down","7:12":"God said, “What prevented you from bowing down when I asked you to?” He said, “I am better than he is. You created me from fire and him from mud.”","7:13":"God said, “Get down from this. It is not for you to be arrogant here. Get out. For you are most arrogant.”","7:14":"He said, “Give me respite until the day they are raised up.”","7:15":"God said, “Be among those who have respite.”","7:16":"He said, “Because you have thrown me out of the way, I will lie in wait for them on your straight way","7:17":"“Then I will assault them from in front and behind them, from their right and their left, nor will You find in most of them any gratitude.”","7:18":"God said, “Get out from here, disgraced and expelled. If any of them follow you, hell will I fill with you all","7:19":"“O Adam, dwell you and your wife in the garden, and enjoy it as you wish, but approach not this tree or you will run into harm and transgression.”","7:20":"Then Satan began to whisper suggestions to them, bringing openly before their minds all their shame which was hidden from them. He said, “Your Lord only made forbidden to you this tree, so that you will not become angels, or such beings that live forever.”","7:21":"And he swore to them both, that he was their sincere adviser","7:22":"So by deceit, he brought about their fall. When they tasted from the tree, their shame became manifest to them, and they began to sew together the leaves of the garden over their bodies, and their Lord called to them, “Did I not forbid you that tree, and tell you that Satan was a sworn enemy to you?”","7:23":"They said, “Our Lord, We have wronged our own souls. If you do not forgive us and do not bestow upon us Your mercy, we will certainly be lost.”","7:24":"God said, “Get down, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood for a time.”","7:25":"He said, “There you will live, and there you will die, but from it will you be taken out.”","7:26":"O children of Adam, We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover your shame, as well as to be an adornment to you, but the raiment of righteousness, that is best. Such are among the signs of God, that they might receive advice","7:27":"O you children of Adam, let not Satan seduce you in the same manner as he seduced your parents out of the garden, stripping them of their raiment, to expose their shame, for he and his party watch you from places where you cannot see them. We made the devils friends to those without faith","7:28":"When they do anything that is shameful they say, “We found our fathers doing so, and God asked us to do this.” Say, “No, God never asks what is shameful. Do you say things about God that you do not know?”","7:29":"Say, “My Lord has commanded justice, and that you submit your whole selves to Him at every time and place of prayer, and call upon Him, making your devotion to Him sincere. As He created you in the beginning, so will you be again.”","7:30":"Some He has guided, others have deserved the loss of their way, in that they took the devils, in preference to God, for their friends and protectors, and think that they receive guidance","7:31":"O children of Adam, take your zeenah with you to every place of prayer. Eat and drink, but waste not by excess, for God does not love wasters","7:32":"Say, “Who has forbidden the beautiful gifts of God which He has produced for His servants, and the things clean and pure for sustenance?” Say, “They are in the life of the present for those who believe, and exclusively for them on the Day of Accountability.” Thus We explain the signs in detail for those who understand","7:33":"Say, “The things that my Lord has indeed made forbidden are shameful deeds whether open or secret, deeds and ideas against truth and reason, assigning partners to God for which He has revealed no authority, and saying things about God which you do not know.”","7:34":"To every people is a term appointed. When their term is reached not an hour can they delay or advance it","7:35":"O you children of Adam, there comes to you messengers from among you, rehearsing My signs to you, those who are righteous and mend their lives, on them will be no fear, nor shall they grieve","7:36":"But those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance, they are companions of the fire, and will dwell in there forever","7:37":"Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against God, or rejects His signs? For them, their appointed portion must reach them from the Book. Until when our messengers arrive and take their souls and they say, “Where are the things that you used to invoke besides God?” They will reply, “They have left us lost,” and they will bear witness against themselves, because they rejected it","7:38":"He will say, “Join the company of the peoples who passed away before you, enter into the fire, humans and jinn.” Every time a new people enter, it curses its sister people, until they follow each other, all into the fire. Says the last about the first, “Our Lord, these are the ones who misled us, so give them a double punishment in the fire.” He will say, “Doubled for all.” But this you do not understand","7:39":"Then the first will say to the last, “See, you have no advantage over us, so taste the penalty for all that you did.”","7:40":"To those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance, no opening will there be of the gates of heaven, nor will they enter the garden, until the camel can pass through the eye of the needle. Such is Our reward for those in sin","7:41":"For them there is hell, as a bed, and folds and folds of covering above. Such is Our punishment for those who do wrong","7:42":"So believe and work righteousness, for no burden do We place on any soul, except that which she can bear. They will be companions of the garden, to dwell therein forever","7:43":"And We will remove from their hearts, any hatred. Beneath them will be rivers flowing and they will say, “Praise God, who has guided us to this. Never would we have found guidance, had it not been for the guidance of God, indeed it was the truth that the messengers of our Lord brought to us.” And they will hear the call, “Behold, the garden before you. You have been made its inheritors, because of your deeds.”","7:44":"The companions of the garden will call out to the companions of the fire, “We have indeed found the promise of our Lord to us, true. Have you also found your Lord’s promise true?” They will say, “Yes.” But a caller will proclaim between them, “The curse of God is on the wrongdoers","7:45":"“Those who hinder others from the path of God, and seek in it something crooked, they were those who denied the hereafter.”","7:46":"Between them will be a veil, and above will be those who would know everyone by their marks. They will call out to the companions of the garden, “Peace be upon you.” They would not have entered, but they will have an assurance of it","7:47":"When their eyes will be turned towards the companions of the fire, they will say, “Our Lord, send us not to the company of the wrongdoers.”","7:48":"Those above will call to those whom they will know from their marks saying, “Of what profit to you were your possessions, and those things about which you were arrogant","7:49":"“Behold, are these not those whom you swore that God, even with His mercy, would never bless? Enter the garden, no fear will be on you, nor will you grieve.”","7:50":"The companions of the fire will call to the companions of the garden, “Pour down to us water or anything that God provides for your sustenance.” They will say, “Both these things have God forbidden to those who rejected Him.”","7:51":"“Those who took their religion to be mere entertainment and play, and were deceived by the life of the world.” That day We will forget them as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs, and because they were accustomed to rejecting Our signs","7:52":"For We had certainly sent to them a book of knowledge which We explained in detail, a guide, and a mercy to all who believe","7:53":"Do they just wait for the final fulfillment of the event? On the day the event is finally fulfilled, those who disregarded it before will say, “The messengers of our Lord indeed brought truth. Have we no intercessors now to intercede on our behalf? Or can we be sent back? Then we would behave differently from our behavior in the past.” In fact, they will have lost their souls, and the things they invented will leave them lost","7:54":"Your Guardian Evolver is God, He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and is firmly established on the throne. He draws the night over the day, each seeking the other in rapid succession. He created the sun, the moon, and the stars, all governed by laws under His command. Is it not His to create and to govern? Blessed is God, the Lord of all the worlds","7:55":"Call on your Guardian Evolver with humility and in private, and God does not love those who trespass beyond bounds","7:56":"Create no chaos on the earth, after it has been set in order, but call on Him with awe and longing, for the mercy of God is near those who do right","7:57":"It is He Who sends the winds like heralds of good news, going before His mercy. When they have carried the heavy-laden clouds, We drive them to a dead land, make rain to descend, and produce there every kind of harvest. Thus will We raise the dead, so that you may remember","7:58":"From the land that is clean and good, by the will of its Guardian Evolver, springs up produce after its kind, but from the land that is corrupt, springs up nothing but that which is corrupt. We explain the signs by various signs to those who are grateful","7:59":"We sent Noah to his people. He said, “O my people, worship God, you have no other god but Him. I fear for you the punishment of a dreadful day","7:60":"The leaders of his people said, “We see that you are obviously in error.”","7:61":"He said, “O my people, I am not in error. In fact, I am a messenger from the Lord of all the worlds","7:62":"“I fulfill towards you the duties of my Lord’s mission. Sincere is my advice to you, and I learned from God, something that you know not","7:63":"“Do you wonder how there has come to you a message from your Lord, through a person of your own people, to warn you, so that you may be conscious of God, and happily receive His mercy?”","7:64":"But they rejected him, and We delivered him and those with him, in the Ark. But We overwhelmed in the flood those who rejected Our signs. They were indeed a blind people","7:65":"To the ‘Ad people, We sent Hud, one of their brothers. He said, \"O my people, worship God, you have no other god but Him. Will you not realize this?”","7:66":"The leaders of the unbelievers among his people said, “We see you are an imbecile,” and “We think you are a liar.”","7:67":"He said, “O my people, I am no imbecile, but I am a messenger from the Guardian Evolver of all the systems of knowledge","7:68":"“I fulfill towards you the duties of my Lord’s mission. I am to you a sincere and trustworthy adviser","7:69":"“Do you wonder how there has come to you a message from your Lord through a person of your own people, to warn you? Call to mind that He made you inheritors after the people of Noah, and gave you great stature among the nations. Call to mind the benefits from God, that you may flourish.”","7:70":"They said, “Do you come to us so that we may worship God alone, and give up the worship of our ancestors? Bring us what you threaten us with, if you tell the truth.”","7:71":"He said, “Punishment upon punishment has already come upon you from your Lord. Do you dispute with me over names which you have devised, you and your ancestors, without authority from God. But wait, I am among you also waiting.”","7:72":"We saved him and those who adhered with him, by Our mercy, and We cut off the roots of those who rejected Our signs and who did not believe","7:73":"To the Thamud people We sent Salih, one of their own brothers. He said, “O my people, worship God, you have no other god but Him. And now there has come to you guidance from your Lord. This she-camel of God is a sign to you. So leave it to graze in God's earth, and let no harm come to it, or you will be seized with a terrible punishment","7:74":"“And remember how He made you inheritors after the ‘Ad people, and gave you houses in the land. You build for yourselves palaces and castles in open plains, and carve out homes in the mountains. So bring to remembrance the good from God, and refrain from harm and crime on the earth.”","7:75":"The leaders of the arrogant group among his people said to those who were considered powerless, them among those who believed, “Are you sure that Salih is a messenger from his Lord?” They said, “We surely believe in the revelation that has been sent through him.”","7:76":"The arrogant party said, “For our part, we reject what you believe.”","7:77":"Then they hamstrung the she-camel, and insolently defied the order of their Lord saying, “O Salih, bring about your threats, if you are a messenger.”","7:78":"So the earthquake took them unaware, and they lay prostrate in their homes","7:79":"So Salih turned away from them saying, “O my people, I did indeed convey to you the message for which I was sent by my Lord. I gave you good counsel, but you love not good counselors.”","7:80":"We also sent Lot. He said to his people, “Do you commit lewdness such as no people in creation committed before you","7:81":"“For you practice your passions on men in preference to women. You are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.”","7:82":"And his people gave no answer but this, “Drive them out of your city. These are indeed people who want to be clean and refined.”","7:83":"But we saved him and his family, except his wife, she was of those who lagged behind","7:84":"And we showered down on them rain. Then do you see what the end of those who indulged in harmful deeds and crime was","7:85":"To the Madyan people We sent Shu’aib, one of their own brothers. He said, “O my people, worship God, you have no other god but Him. Now there has come to you guidance from your Lord, so give just measure and weight, and do not withhold from the people the things due to them.

Nor could we, by any means, return to it unless it is by the will of God, Our Lord. Our Lord can reach out to the utmost recesses of things with His knowledge. In God we trust. Our Lord, decide between us and our people with truth, for You are the best to decide.”","7:90":"The unbelieving leaders among his people said, “If you follow Shu’aib, be sure that you will be ruined.”","7:91":"But the earthquake took them unaware, and they lay prostrate in their homes","7:92":"The people who rejected Shu’aib were as if they had never been in the homes where they had prospered. The people who rejected Shu’aib were ruined","7:93":"So Shu’aib left them saying, “O my people, I indeed conveyed to you the messages for which I was sent by my Guardian Evolver. I gave you good advice, but how can I grieve over a people who refuse to believe.”","7:94":"Whenever We sent a messenger to a place, We raised up its people in suffering and adversity, in order that they might learn humility","7:95":"Then We changed their suffering into prosperity, until they grew and multiplied, and began to say, “Our parents too were touched by adversity and prosperity.” Behold, We called them to account all of a sudden, while they realized it not","7:96":"If the people of the towns had only believed and had been conscious of God, We would indeed have opened up to them blessings from heaven and earth, but they rejected it, and We brought them to account for their misdeeds","7:97":"Did the people of the towns feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they slept","7:98":"Or did they feel secure against its coming in broad daylight while they played","7:99":"Did they then feel immune concerning the plan of God? No one feels immune concerning the plan of God except those bound for failure","7:100":"To those who inherit the earth in succession to its previous possessors, is it not a guiding lesson for them that if We so willed, We could punish them for their sins, and seal up their hearts so that they could not hear","7:101":"These were the towns whose story We relate to you. Indeed there came to them their messengers with guidance, but they would not believe what they had before rejected. This is how God seals up the hearts of those who do not believe","7:102":"We did not find most of them true to their covenant, but most of them We found rebellious","7:103":"Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his leaders, but they wrongfully rejected them. So take notice of the end of those who do wrong","7:104":"Moses said, “O Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Lord of all the worlds","7:105":"One who it is right to say nothing but truth concerning God. Now I have come to you from your Guardian Evolver with guidance. So let the Children of Israel exit along with me.”","7:106":"Pharaoh said, “If indeed you have come with a sign, show it if you tell the truth.”","7:107":"Then Moses threw his staff, and behold, it was a serpent, plain for all to see","7:108":"And he pulled out his hand, and behold, it looked white to all beholders","7:109":"Said the nomarchs of the people of Pharaoh, “This is indeed an illusionist well-versed","7:110":"“His plan is to get you out of your land. So what is it you advise?”","7:111":"They said, “Keep him and his brother in suspense, and send to the cities, people to collect","7:112":"And bring up to you all illusionists well-versed.”","7:113":"So the illusionists came to Pharaoh. They said, “Of course we will have a reward if we win?”","7:114":"He said, “Yes, for you will, in that case, be nearest to me.”","7:115":"They said, “O Moses, will you throw first, or shall we throw?”","7:116":"Said Moses, “You throw.” When they threw, they tricked the eyes of people, and struck fear into them, for they showed great illusions","7:117":"We put into Moses’ mind by inspiration, “Throw your staff.” And behold, it instantly made all the illusions that they faked disappear","7:118":"So truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect","7:119":"So they were thoroughly defeated there and then, crushed","7:120":"But the illusionists fell down prostrate in adoration","7:121":"Saying, “We believe in the Lord of all the worlds","7:122":"“The Lord of Moses and Aaron.”","7:123":"Pharaoh said, “Believe in Him before I give you permission? Surely this is a scheme plotted in the city to drive out its people, and soon will you come to know","7:124":"“Be sure that I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will cause you all to die on the cross.”","7:125":"They said, “We will be sent back to our Guardian Evolver","7:126":"“You wreak your vengeance on us simply because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they reached us”. “Our Lord, pour out on us patience and constancy, and take our souls to you in peace.”","7:127":"Said the nomarchs of Pharaoh’s people, “Will you leave Moses and his people to spread sedition in the land, and to abandon you and your gods?” He said, “Their male children we will slay, and their females will we let live, and we have power over them, irresistible.”","7:128":"Moses said to his people, “Pray for help from God, and patiently persevere, for the earth is God's to give as an inheritance to those of His servants He pleases, and the end is for the righteous","7:129":"They said, “We have had troubles, both before and after you came to us.” He said, “It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you inheritors in the earth, so He may try you by your deeds.”","7:130":"We punished the people of Pharaoh with years of drought and shortness of crops, that they might take the advice","7:131":"But when good times came they said, “This is due to us,” When gripped by calamity, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses and those with him. Behold, in truth, the omens of evil are theirs in God's sight, but most of them do not understand","7:132":"They said, “No matter the signs you bring along with that which you use to deceive us, we will never believe in you","7:133":"So We sent on them the flood, locusts, lice, frogs, and the blood. Signs openly self-explained, but they were steeped in arrogance, a people given to harmful deeds","7:134":"Every time the penalty fell on them they said, “O Moses, call on your Lord on our behalf, calling on his promise to you. If you will remove the penalty from us, we will truly believe in you, and we will send away the Children of Israel with you.”","7:135":"But every time We removed the penalty from them according to a fixed term which they had to fulfill, behold, they broke their promise","7:136":"So We took retribution from them and We drowned them in the sea, because they rejected Our signs and failed to take warning from them","7:137":"And We made a people considered weak, inheritors of lands in both East and West, lands where We sent down Our blessings. The promise of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel, because they had patience and constancy. And We destroyed what they designed and what Pharaoh and his people constructed","7:138":"We took the Children of Israel across the sea. They came upon a people devoted entirely to the idols they had. They said, “O Moses, create for us a god like the gods they have.” He said, “Surely you are a people without knowledge","7:139":"“As for these, the cult they are in is a piece of a ruin, and vain is that which they practice.”","7:140":"He said, “Should I seek for you a god other than God, when it is God Who has endowed you with gifts above the nations?”","7:141":"And remember We rescued you from Pharaoh’s people, who afflicted you with the worst of penalties, who slew your sons and kept alive your females. In that was a momentous trial from your Lord","7:142":"We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed the period with ten more. So was completed the term with his Lord, forty nights, and Moses had charged his brother Aaron, “Represent me among my people, do right, and do not follow the way of those who do wrong.”","7:143":"When Moses came to the place appointed by Us, and his Guardian Evolver addressed him, then he said, “O my Lord, show Yourself to me that I may look upon you.” God said, “By no means can you see Me, but look upon the mountain, if it remains in its place, then will you see Me.” When his Lord manifested His glory on the mountain, He made it as particles, and Moses fainted. When he returned to consciousness he said, “Glory be to You, to You do I turn, and I am the first to believe.”","7:144":"God said, “O Moses, I have chosen you above others, by the mission I have given you and the words I have spoken to you. So take that which I give you, and be of those who give thanks.”","7:145":"And We ordained the Commandments for him in the Tablets concerning all matters, both commanding and explaining all things, and he said, “Take and hold these with firmness, and encourage your people to hold fast by the best practices. Soon I will show you the homes of the wicked.”","7:146":"Those who behave arrogantly on the earth in defiance of right, I will turn them away from My signs. Even if they see all the signs, they will not believe in them, and if they see the right way of conduct, they will not accept it as the way, but if they see the way of error, that is the way they will accept, for they have rejected our signs, and failed to take warning from them","7:147":"Those who reject Our signs and the meeting in the hereafter, in vain are their deeds. Can they expect to be punished for anything except for what they have done","7:148":"The people of Moses made out of their ornaments, in his absence, the image of a calf. It was low. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them, nor show them the way? They took it for worship and they did wrong","7:149":"When they repented, and saw that they had erred, they said, “If our Lord does not have mercy upon us and does not forgive us, we will indeed be of those who perish.”","7:150":"When Moses came back to his people displeased and grieved he said, “You have done wrong in my absence. Did you want to induce the judgment of your Lord?” He put down the tablets, seized his brother by his hair, and dragged him to himself. Aaron said, “Son of my mother, the people indeed saw me as nothing, and nearly murdered me. Do not allow the enemies to rejoice over my misfortune, nor count me among the people of sin.”","7:151":"Moses prayed, “O my Lord, forgive my brother and me, admit us to Your mercy, for You are more mercifully redeeming than all of those who show mercy.”","7:152":"Those who took the calf will indeed be overwhelmed with punishment from their Lord, and with shame in this life. This is how We reward those who deceive","7:153":"But those who do wrong, but repent and believe, indeed your Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","7:154":"When the displeasure of Moses subsided, he picked up the tablets. In the writing was guidance and mercy for those who are aware of their Guardian Evolver","7:155":"And Moses chose seventy of his people for Our meeting place. When they were seized with violent quaking he prayed, “O my Lord, if it had been Your will, You could have caused to perish, long before, both them and me. Would You destroy us all for the deeds of the foolish ones among us? This is no more than Your trial. By it, You cause whom You will to stray, and You lead whom You will onto the right path. You are our Protector, so forgive us and give us Your mercy, for You are the best of those who forgive","7:156":"“And ordain for us that which is good, in this life and in the hereafter, for we have turned to You.” He said, “With My punishment I visit whom I will, but My mercy extends to all things, and I will ordain My mercy for those who do right, and give zakat, and those who believe in Our signs","7:157":"“Those who follow the messenger, the prophet of mother wit, who they find mentioned in their own scriptures, in the Torah and the gospel. For he commands them what is just and forbids them what is unjust, he encourages for them as permissible that which is good, and prohibits them from what is harmful. He releases them from their heavy burdens and from the chains that are upon them. So it is those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the light which is sent down to him, it is these who will flourish.”","7:158":"Say, “O humanity, I am sent to you all as the messenger of God, to Whom belongs the control of the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He. It is He Who gives both life and death. So believe in God and His messenger, the prophet of mother wit, who believes in God and His words. Follow him that you may be guided.”","7:159":"Of the people of Moses, a group of them guides and does justice in the light of truth","7:160":"We divided them into twelve peoples. We directed Moses by inspiration, when his people asked him for water We said, “Split the rock with your staff.” Out of it, gushed forth twelve springs. Each group knew its place for water. We gave them the shade of clouds, and sent down to them manna and quails saying, “Eat of the good things We have provided for you.” Then to Us they did no harm, but they harmed their own selves","7:161":"And remember it was said to them, “Dwell in this town and eat as you wish, but say a word of humility, and enter the gate in a posture of humility. We will forgive you your faults, and We will increase those who do right.”","7:162":"But the transgressors among them changed the words from that which had been given them, so we sent on them a plague from heaven, because they repeatedly transgressed","7:163":"Ask them concerning the town standing close by the sea. Behold, they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath, for on the day of their Sabbath, the fish came to them openly, holding up their heads. But on the day they had no Sabbath, they did not come. We made a trial of them, for they were given to transgression","7:164":"When some of them said, “Why do you advise a people who God will destroy or visit with a terrible punishment?” The advisers said, “To be absolved, fulfill your duty to your Lord, that they may be conscious.”","7:165":"When they disregarded the warnings that had been given them, We then rescued those who made wrongdoing forbidden, but We visited the wrongdoers with a terrible punishment, because they were given to transgression","7:166":"When, in their insolence, they transgressed prohibitions We said to them, “Be apes, despised and rejected.”","7:167":"Behold, your Lord declared that He would send against them, until the Day of Accountability, those who would afflict them with a terrible penalty. Your Lord is quick in retribution, but He is also Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","7:168":"We separated them into groups on this earth. There are among them some who are righteous, and some who are not. We have tried them with both prosperity and adversity, in order that they might change","7:169":"After them succeeded another generation. They inherited the Book, but they chose the vanities of the present saying, “For us, everything will be forgiven.” If similar vanities came their way, they would again seize them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from those who would not ascribe to God anything but the truth? And they study what is in the Book. But best for the righteous is the home in the hereafter. Will you not then understand","7:170":"As for those who hold fast by the Book and establish prayer, never will We cause the reward of the righteous to perish","7:171":"When We shook the Mount over them, as if it had been a canopy, and they thought it was going to fall on them We said, “Hold firmly to what We have given you, and bring to remembrance what is in there, so perhaps you may be conscious.”","7:172":"When your Lord brought out from the children of Adam, from their loins, their descendants, and made them testify concerning themselves saying, “Am I not your Lord?” They said, “Yes, we do testify.” Lest you should say on the Day of Accountability, “Of this we were never mindful.”","7:173":"Or lest you should say, “Our parents before us may have taken false gods, but we are their descendants. Will You then destroy us because of the deeds of people who were irresponsible?”","7:174":"We explain the signs in detail that perhaps they may repent","7:175":"Relate to them the story of the person to whom We sent Our signs, but he passed them by, so Satan followed him up, and he went astray","7:176":"If it had been Our will, We would have elevated him with Our signs, but he inclined to the earth, and followed his own vain desires. His similitude is that of a dog. If you pet it, it lolls out its tongue, or if you ignore it, it still lolls out its tongue. That is the similitude of those who reject Our signs. So relate the story, perhaps they may reflect","7:177":"Terrible for a similitude are the people who reject Our signs and wrong their own souls","7:178":"Whom God guides, he is on the right path. Whom He rejects from His guidance, such people will perish","7:179":"Many are the jinn and humans We have made for hell. They have hearts with which they feel not, eyes with which they see not, and ears with which they hear not. They are like cows, no, more apathetic, and they are heedless","7:180":"The most beautiful names belong to God, so call on Him by them, and caution people who use profanity in His names, and that for what they do, they will soon be rewarded","7:181":"Of those We have created, are those who direct with truth and dispense justice","7:182":"Those who reject Our signs, We will gradually visit with punishment, in ways they cannot imagine","7:183":"Respite will I grant to them, for My plan is strong and unfailing","7:184":"Do they not reflect? Their companion is not seized with madness, he is only a clear warner","7:185":"Do they see nothing in the systems of the heavens and the earth, and all that God has created? Do they not see that it may well be that their term is near and ending? In what message after this will they then believe","7:186":"Those who God rejects from His guidance, there can be no guide. He will leave them in their trespasses, wandering in distraction","7:187":"They ask you about the Hour, when will be its appointed time? Say, “The knowledge of it is with my Lord. None but He can reveal as to when it will occur. Heavy will be its burden through the heavens and the earth. All of a sudden it will come to you.” They ask you as if you were eager in search of it. Say, “The knowledge of it is with God.\" But most understand not","7:188":"Say, “I have no power over any good or harm to myself except as God wills. If I had knowledge of the unknown, I would have multiplied all good, and no harm would have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of good news to those who have faith.”","7:189":"It is He Who created you from a single person, and made her mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her in love. When they are united, she bears a light burden and carries it about. When she grows heavy, they both pray to God their Lord saying, “If You give us an excellent child, we promise to be grateful.”","7:190":"But when He gives them an excellent child, they ascribe to others a share in the gift they have received, but God is exalted high above the partners they ascribe to Him","7:191":"Do they indeed ascribe to Him as partners, things that can create nothing but are themselves created","7:192":"No aid can they give them, nor can they aid themselves","7:193":"If you call them to guidance, they will not follow. For you it is the same whether you call them or you hold your peace","7:194":"Indeed, those whom you call upon besides God are servants like you. Call upon them and let them respond to your prayer, if you are truthful","7:195":"Have they feet with which to walk? Or hands with which to touch? Or eyes with which to see? Or ears with which to hear?

You will see them looking at you, but they see not","7:199":"Hold to forgiveness, command what is right, and turn away from the ignorant","7:200":"If a suggestion from Satan assails you, seek refuge with God, for He hears and knows all things","7:201":"Indeed those who are conscious, when a thought of wrongdoing from Satan assaults them they bring God to remembrance until they see","7:202":"But their brothers, the wrong-doers, plunge them ever deeper into error, and never relax their efforts","7:203":"If you do not bring them a revelation they say, “Why do you not have it all together?” Say, “I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord. This is enlightenment from your Lord, and guidance, and mercy, for any who have faith.”","7:204":"When the Quran is read, listen to it with attention, and hold your peace, that you may receive mercy","7:205":"And do you, O reader, bring your Lord to remembrance in your very soul, with humility and in reverence, without audible words, in the mornings and evenings, and be not of those who are unheedful","7:206":"Those who are near to your Lord, do not dislike worshipping Him. They praise Him, and bow down before Him","8:1":"They ask you concerning spoils of war. Say, “Spoils are at the disposal of God and the messenger. So be conscious of God, and keep the relations between yourselves straight. And follow God and His messenger, if you do believe.”","8:2":"The believers are those who, when God is mentioned, feel a tremble in their hearts, and when they hear His signs rehearsed, find their faith strengthened, and put all their trust in their Lord","8:3":"They establish prayer and give out of the gifts We have given them for sustenance","8:4":"Such in truth are the believers. They have degrees of dignity with their Lord, forgiveness and generous sustenance","8:5":"Your Lord ordered you out of your house in truth, even though a group among the believers disliked it","8:6":"They disputing with you concerning the truth after it was made clear, as if they were being driven to death and they saw it","8:7":"Behold, God promised that one of the two enemy groups would be yours. You wished that the one unarmed would be yours, but God willed to justify the truth according to His words, and to cut off the roots of the unbelievers","8:8":"That He might justify truth and prove falsehood false, distasteful as it is to those guilty","8:9":"Remember you implored the assistance of your Guardian Evolver and He answered you, “I will assist you with a thousand of the angels, ranks upon ranks.”","8:10":"God made it a message of hope, and an assurance to your hearts. There is no help except from God, and God is Exalted in Power, the Wise","8:11":"Remember He covered you with a sort of drowsiness, to give you calm as from Him.

Strike above their necks and strike every finger-tip from them.”","8:13":"This is because they contended against God and His messenger. If any contend against God and His messenger, God is strict in punishment","8:14":"Then it will be said, “Taste the punishment. For those who resist God, is the penalty of the fire.”","8:15":"O you who believe, when you meet the unbelievers while advancing, never turn your backs to them","8:16":"If any turn his back to them on such a day, unless it be in a strategy of war, or to retreat to join the other troops, he draws on himself the punishment of God, and his abode is hell, what a terrible place","8:17":"It is not you who slew them, but it was God. When you threw a handful of dust, it was not your act, but God's, in order that He might challenge the believers by a gracious trial from Himself, for God is He Who hears and knows all things","8:18":"That, and because God is He Who makes weak the plans and strategy of the unbelievers","8:19":"If you prayed for victory and judgment, judgment has now come to you. If you stop, it will be best for you. If you return to the attack, so will We. Not the least good will your forces be to you even if they were multiplied, for indeed God is with those who believe","8:20":"O you who believe, follow God and His messenger, and do not turn away from him when you hear him speak","8:21":"Nor be like those who say, “We hear, but do not listen","8:22":"For the worst of creatures in the sight of God are the deaf and the dumb, those who understand not","8:23":"If God had found in them any good, He would indeed have made them listen. If He had made them listen, they would have turned back and rejected","8:24":"O you who believe, respond to God and His messenger when he calls you to that which will give you life, and know that God hovers between a person and his heart, and to Him you all will be gathered","8:25":"And be aware of trials which affects not only those of you who do wrong, and know that God is strict in punishment","8:26":"Call to mind when you were a small group, despised throughout the land, and afraid that the people might harm you.

They plot and plan, and God too plans, but the best of planners is God","8:31":"When Our signs are rehearsed to them they say, “We have heard this before. If we wished, we could say words like these. These are nothing but tales of the ancient.”","8:32":"Remember how they said, “O God, if this is indeed the truth from You, rain down on us a shower of stones from the sky, or send us a terrible penalty.”","8:33":"But God was not going to send them a penalty while you were among them, nor was He going to send it while they could still ask for forgiveness","8:34":"But what plea do they have that God should not punish them, when they keep out the people from the Sacred Masjid, though they are not its guardians? No people can be its guardians except the righteous, but most of them do not understand","8:35":"Their prayer at the House is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands, “Taste you the penalty because you blasphemed.”","8:36":"The disbelievers give their wealth to hinder people from the path of God, and they will continue to give. But in the end, they will have regrets, then they will be overcome, and the disbelievers will be gathered together to hell","8:37":"In order that God may separate the corrupt from the innocent.

Indeed, I see what you do not see. Indeed I fear God, for God is strict in punishment.”","8:49":"Then the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease said, “These people, their way has misled them.” But if any trust in God, behold, God is the Exalted in Might, the Wise","8:50":"If you could see when the angels take the souls of the unbelievers, and they strike their faces and their backs saying, “Taste the penalty of the blazing fire","8:51":"“Because of what your hands sent forth, for God is never unjust to His servants","8:52":"“Like the way of the people of Pharaoh and of those before them.

But God has done it, for He is Exalted in Might, the Wise","8:64":"O messenger, enough for you is God, and for those who follow you among the believers","8:65":"O messenger, rouse the believers to the fight. If there are twenty among you, patient and persevering, they will defeat two hundred. If a hundred, they will defeat a thousand of the unbelievers, for these are people without understanding","8:66":"For the time being, God has lightened your task, for He knows that there is a soft-spot in you, but if there are a hundred of you, patient and persevering, they will defeat two hundred, and if a thousand, they will defeat two thousand, by the permission of God, for God is with those who patiently persevere","8:67":"It is not fitting for a prophet to have prisoners of war until he has fought in the land. You look for the temporary goods of the present, but God looks to the hereafter, and God is Exalted in Might, the Wise","8:68":"Had it not been for previous ordainment from God, a severe penalty would have reached you for that which you took","8:69":"But enjoy what you took in war, permissible and good, but be conscious of God, for God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","8:70":"O messenger, say to those who are captives in your hands, “If God finds any good in your hearts, He will give you something better than that which has been taken from you, and He will forgive you, for God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming.”","8:71":"But if they have deceptive plans against you, they have already committed treason against God, so He has given you power over them, and God is He Who has knowledge and wisdom","8:72":"Those who believed, and accepted exile, and fought for the faith with their property and their persons in the cause of God, as well as those who gave them asylum and aid, these are friends and protectors of each other. As for those who believed but did not go into exile, you owe no duty of protection, until they go into exile. But if they seek your aid, it is your duty to help them. Except against a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance. And God sees all that you do","8:73":"The unbelievers are protectors, one of another. So unless you protect each other, there will be tumult and oppression on earth, and great crimes","8:74":"Those who believe and go into exile, and fight for the faith in the cause of God, as well as those who give them asylum and aid, these are all, in truth, the believers. For them is the forgiveness of sins and a provision most generous","8:75":"And those who then accept faith and go into exile, and fight for the faith in your company, they are of you. But family by blood has first rights over the others in the book of God, and indeed God is well acquainted with all things","9:1":"Announce a declaration of immunity from God and His messenger to the pagans with whom you have contracted a mutual alliance","9:2":"Go then for four months, backward and forward throughout the land, but know that you cannot stop God, but that God will cover with shame those who reject Him","9:3":"And announce from God and His messenger, to the people on the day of the Great Hajj, that God and His messenger dissolves your obligations to the pagans. If you then repent, it is best for you. But if you turn away, know that you cannot stop God. And proclaim a terrible penalty to those who do not believe","9:4":"But the treaties are not dissolved with those pagans with whom you have entered into an alliance, and who have not since failed you concerning anything, nor aided anyone against you. So fulfill your responsibility to them to the end of their term, for God loves the righteous","9:5":"But when the forbidden months have passed, fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them. And seize them, surround them, and lie and wait for them with every strategy of war. But if they repent, establish prayer, and give zakat, then open the way for them, for God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","9:6":"If anyone among the pagans asks you for asylum, grant it to him, so that he may hear the word of God. Then escort him to where he can be secure, because they are people without knowledge","9:7":"How can there be an alliance before God and His messenger with the pagans, except those with whom you made a treaty near the Sacred Masjid? As long as they stand true to you, stand true to them, for God loves the righteous","9:8":"And how can there be such an alliance, seeing that if they get an advantage over you, they will not respect the ties of family or covenant? With words from their mouths they entice you, but their hearts are averse to you, and most of them are rebellious and wicked","9:9":"They have sold the signs of God for a miserable price, and many have they hindered from His way. Wrong indeed are the deeds they have done","9:10":"They do not respect believers’ ties of family or covenant. They have transgressed all bounds","9:11":"But if they repent, establish prayer, and give zakat, then they are your brothers and sisters in faith. We explain the signs in detail, for those who understand","9:12":"But if they violate their promises after their covenant, and taunt you for your faith, fight the leaders of disbelief, for their promises mean nothing to them. Do this so that they may be restrained","9:13":"Will you not fight the people who violated their promises, plotted to expel the messenger, and took the offensive by being the first to assault you? Do you fear them? No, it is God Whom you should fear, if you believe","9:14":"Fight them, and God will punish them by your hands, cover them with shame, help you to victory over them, heal the chest of believers","9:15":"And remove anger from their hearts, for God will turn to whom He wills, and God is All Knowing, All Wise","9:16":"Or do you think that you will be abandoned, as though God did not know those among you who strive? And take none for friends and protectors except God, His messenger, and the believers? But God is well acquainted with all that you do","9:17":"It is not for those who join gods with God to visit or maintain the places of worship of God, while witnessing against their own selves to unbelief. The works of such people bear no fruit, and they will dwell in fire","9:18":"The place of worship of God will be visited and maintained by those who believe in God and the Last Day, establish prayer, give zakat, and who fear none except God. They should expect to be on true guidance","9:19":"Do you make the giving of drink to pilgrims, or the maintenance of the Sacred Masjid, equal to the deeds of those who believe in God and the Last Day, and strive in the cause of God? They are not comparable in the sight of God, and God does not guide those who do wrong","9:20":"Those who believe, suffer exile, and strive in God's cause with their goods and their persons, have the highest rank in the sight of God. They are the people who will achieve salvation","9:21":"Their Lord gives them good news of mercy from Himself, of His blessings, and of gardens for them, wherein are pleasures that endure","9:22":"They will dwell therein forever. Indeed in God's presence is a great reward","9:23":"O you who believe, do not take your parents and your siblings for protectors, if they love unbelief above faith. If any of you do so, they do wrong","9:24":"Say, if your parents, your children, your siblings, your spouses, your extended family, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, or the homes in which you love, are dearer to you than God or His messenger, or the striving in His cause, then wait until God brings about His decision. And God does not guide the rebellious","9:25":"Surely God helped you in many battlefields, and on the day of Hunain. Remember, your great numbers elated you, but they availed you nothing. The land, as wide as it is, constrained you and you turned back in retreat","9:26":"But God poured His calm on the messenger and on the believers, and sent down forces which you did not see. He punished the unbelievers. And that is the punishment for those without faith","9:27":"Again, after this, God will turn to whom He wills. For God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","9:28":"O you who believe, truly the pagans are corrupt, so do not let them, after this year of theirs, approach the Sacred Masjid. And if you fear poverty, soon God will enrich you, if He wills, out of His bounty, for God is All Knowing, All Wise","9:29":"Fight those who do not believe in God, nor the Last Day, nor hold forbidden which has been forbidden by God and His messenger, nor acknowledge the way of truth, even if they are of the people of the Book, until they pay the jizyah with willingness, even though they are of modest means","9:30":"The Jews call ‘Uzair a son of God, and the Christians call Christ the son of God. That is a saying from their mouth. They only imitate what the unbelievers in the past used to say. God's curse is on them. Indeed they are deluded","9:31":"They take their scholarly and religious to be their lords instead of God, as well as Christ the son of Mary, although they were asked to worship only One God. There is no god but He. Praise and Glory be to Him, and far is He from having the partners they associate with Him","9:32":"They try to extinguish God's light with their mouths, but God will not allow that, but only that His light should be brightened, even though the unbelievers hate it","9:33":"It is He Who has sent His messenger with guidance and the natural way of life, to proclaim it over all ways of life, even though the pagans detest it","9:34":"O you who believe, there are indeed many among the religious scholars and religious leaders, who unjustly take the sustenance of people and hinder them from the way of God, and there are those who bury gold and silver and do not give it in the way of God. Announce to them a most terrible penalty","9:35":"On the day when heat will be produced out of that wealth in the fire of hell, and with it their foreheads will be branded, their sides, and their backs, “This is the treasure which you buried for yourselves. Now taste of the treasures you buried.”","9:36":"The number of months in the sight of God is twelve, ordained by Him the day He created the heavens and the earth. Of them four are sacred. That is the upright religion. Thus do not wrong yourselves, and fight the pagans together as they fight you together, but know that God is with those who restrain themselves","9:37":"Indeed postponing it is additional unbelief. The unbelievers are led to wrong by it, for they make it permissible one year and forbidden another year, in order to change the number of months forbidden by God, and to make forbidden ones permissible. Their wrong way seems right to them, but God does not guide those who do not believe","9:38":"O you who believe, what is the matter with you, that when you are asked to go forward in the cause of God, you cling heavily to the earth? Do you prefer the life of the present to the hereafter? But little are the comforts of this life, as compared with the hereafter","9:39":"Unless you move forward, He will punish you with a terrible penalty and put others in your place, but you would not harm Him in the least, for God has power over all things","9:40":"Since you would not help him, God indeed helped him when the unbelievers drove him out. He had no more than one companion, the two were in the cave, and he said to his companion, “Have no fear, God is with us.” Then God sent down His peace upon him, and strengthened him with forces which you did not see, and humbled the word of the unbelievers, but the word of God is exalted to the heights, for God is Exalted in Might, the Wise","9:41":"Move forward, whether lightly equipped or heavily equipped, and strive and struggle with your goods and your persons, in the cause of God. That is best for you, if you only knew","9:42":"If there had been immediate gain, and the journey was easy, they would all, without doubt, have followed you, but the distance was long. They indeed swear by God, “If we could, we would certainly have come out with you.” They ruin their own-selves, for God knows that they are certainly lying","9:43":"God forgives you, but why did you not grant leave to them until it became evident to you those who were truthful, and you knew indeed who the liars were","9:44":"Those who believe in God and the Last Day do not ask you for exemption from fighting with their goods and persons, and God knows well those who do their duty","9:45":"The only ones who asks you for exemption are those who do not believe in God and the Last Day, or whose hearts are in doubt, so that they are tossed in their doubts, back and forth","9:46":"If they had intended to come, they would certainly have prepared. But God was against their coming, so He made them lag behind, and they were told, “Sit among those who sit.”","9:47":"If they had come with you, they would not have contributed anything but disorder, hurrying back and forth in your presence, and sowing sedition among you. And there would have been among you, some who would have listened to them. But God knows well those who do wrong","9:48":"Indeed they had plotted sedition before, and upset matters for you, until the truth arrived, and the decree of God became manifest, much to their disappointment","9:49":"Among them are the people who say, “Grant me exemption, and draw me not into a trial.” Have they not fallen into a trial already? And indeed hell surrounds the unbelievers","9:50":"If good befalls you, it grieves them, but if a misfortune befalls you they say, “We indeed took precautions beforehand,” And they turn away rejoicing","9:51":"Say, “Nothing will happen to us except what God has decreed. He is our protector.” And on God let the believers put their trust","9:52":"Say, “Can you expect for us any fate other than one of two glorious things? But we can expect that for you either that God will send His punishment from Himself, or by our hands. So wait, we too will wait with you.”","9:53":"Say, “Give willingly or unwillingly, but it will not be accepted from you, for you are indeed a people rebellious and wicked.”","9:54":"The reasons their contributions are not accepted are that they reject God and His messenger. They come to prayer without earnestness, and they offer contributions unwillingly","9:55":"Let not their wealth nor their children dazzle you. In reality, God's plan is to punish them with these things in this life, and that their souls may perish in their denial of God","9:56":"They swear by God that they are indeed with you, but they are not with you. So they are afraid","9:57":"If they could find a place to flee to, a cave or some other place to hide, they would rush there","9:58":"And among them are the people who criticize you concerning charity. If they are given part of it they are pleased, but if not behold, they are indignant","9:59":"If only they had been content with what God and His messenger gave them and said, “Sufficient for us is God. God and His messenger will soon give us of His bounty. To God we turn our hopes.”","9:60":"Sadaqah is for the poor and the needy, those employed to administer it, those whose hearts have been reconciled, those in bondage and in debt, and are in the cause of God, and for displaced persons. This is ordained by God, and God is full of knowledge and wisdom","9:61":"Among them are the people who harass the Prophet and say, “He is all ears.” Say, “He listens to what is best for you. He believes in God, has faith in the believers, and is a mercy to those of you who believe.” But those who harass the messenger will have a terrible penalty","9:62":"To you they swear by God, in order to please you. But it is more fitting that they should please God and His messenger, if they are believers","9:63":"Do they not know that for those who oppose God and His messenger is the fire of hell where they will dwell forever? That is the terrible disgrace","9:64":"The hypocrites are afraid that a Surah will be sent down about them, revealing what is in their heart. Say, “You mock, but indeed God will bring to light all that you fear.”","9:65":"If you question them they declare, “We were only talking, we were playing.” Say, “Was it God, His signs, and His messenger which you were mocking?”","9:66":"Make you no excuses. You have rejected faith after you had accepted it. If We pardon some of you, We will punish others among you, because they are wrongdoers","9:67":"The hypocrites, men and women, are with each other. They encourage evil and forbid what is just, and close their hands. They have forgotten God, so He has forgotten them. Indeed the hypocrites are rebellious","9:68":"God has promised the hypocrites, men and women, and the rejecters of faith, the fire of hell. Therein will they dwell. Appropriate is it for them. For them is the curse of God and an enduring punishment","9:69":"As in the case of those before you. They were mightier than you were, and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their portion, as you enjoy yours. As did those before you. And you indulge in idle talk as they did. Their work is fruitless in the present and in the hereafter, and they lose much","9:70":"Has the story not reached them of those before them, like the people of Noah, ‘Ad, Thamud, the people of Abraham, the people of Midian, and the cities overthrown? To them came their messengers with clear signs. God did not wrong them, but they wrong their own souls","9:71":"The believers, men and women, are protectors one of another. They encourage what is right and forbid what is wrong. They observe prayer, give zakat, and follow God and His messenger. On them God will pour His mercy, for God is Exalted in Power, the Wise","9:72":"God has promised to believers, men and women, gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein. And beautiful mansions in gardens of everlasting bliss. But the greatest bliss is the blessings of God, that is the ultimate accomplishment","9:73":"O prophet, strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm against them. Their abode is hell, an evil refuge indeed","9:74":"They swear by God that they said nothing, but indeed they uttered blasphemy, and they did it after accepting Al-Islam. And they devised a plot which they were unable to carry out. The revenge of theirs was the return for the bounty with which God and His messenger had enriched them. If they repent, it will be best for them, but if they turn back, God will punish them with a terrible penalty in this life and in the next. They will have none on earth to protect or help them","9:75":"Among them are the people who made a covenant with God, that if He bestowed on them His bounty, they would give in charity, and be truly among those who are righteous","9:76":"But when He bestowed His bounty, they became consumed with greed, and turned back aversely","9:77":"So He has put hypocrisy into their hearts, until the day they will meet Him, because they broke their covenant with God, and because they lied","9:78":"Do they not know that God knows their secret and their secret counsels, and that God knows well all things unknown","9:79":"Those who slander those believers who give freely in charity, as well as those who can find nothing to give except the fruits of their labor, and those who throw ridicule on them, God will throw back their ridicule, and they will have a terrible penalty","9:80":"Whether you ask for their forgiveness or not. Even if you ask seventy times for their forgiveness, God will not forgive them, because they have rejected God and His messenger, and God does not guide those who are rebellious","9:81":"Those who were left behind rejoiced in their inaction behind the back of the messenger of God, and they hated to strive and fight with their goods and their persons in the cause of God. They said, “Do not go forward in the heat.” Say, “The fire of hell is fiercer in heat.” If only they could understand","9:82":"Let them laugh a little, much will they weep. A reward for what they do","9:83":"If God then brings you back to any of them, and they ask your permission to go say, “Never will you come with me, nor fight an enemy with me, for you preferred to sit inactive the first time. So sit with those who lag behind.”","9:84":"Nor should you ever pray for any of them that die, nor stand at their grave, for they rejected God and His messenger, and died rejecting","9:85":"Nor let their wealth nor their children dazzle you. God's plan is to punish them with the things of the present, and for their souls to perish for their rejecting it","9:86":"When a Surah comes down, encouraging them to believe in God and to strive and fight along with His messenger, those with wealth and influence among them ask you for exemption. Say, “Leave us. We will be with those who sit.”","9:87":"They prefer to be with those who remain behind. Their hearts are sealed, so they do not understand","9:88":"But the messenger, and those who believe with him, strive and fight with their wealth and their persons, for them are all good things, and they will flourish","9:89":"God has prepared for them gardens with rivers flowing through them, to dwell therein forever. That is the ultimate accomplishment","9:90":"And there were among the desert Arabs, those who made excuses and came to claim exemption. And those who lied to God and His messenger sat inactive. Soon a terrible penalty will seize the unbelievers among them","9:91":"There is no blame on those who are infirm or ill, or who find no resources to give. If they are sincere to God and His messenger, no ground of complaint can there be against those who do right, and God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","9:92":"Nor on those who came to you to be provided with mounts and when you said, “I can find no mounts for you,” they eventually left, their eyes streaming with tears of grief, because they could not find the resources","9:93":"The grounds of complaint are against those who claim exemption while they are rich. They prefer to stay with those who remain behind. God sealed their hearts, but they knew not. 93 (End of Part)","9:94":"They will present their excuses to you when you return to them. Say, “Make no excuses, we will not believe you. God has already informed us of the true state of affairs concerning you. God and His messenger will observe your actions. In the end you will be brought back to He Who knows what is secret and what is open. Then He will show you the truth of all that you did.”","9:95":"They will swear to you by God when you return to them so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone, for they are a disgrace, and hell is their dwelling-place, a fitting reward for what they did","9:96":"They will swear to you so that you may be pleased with them, but even if you are pleased with them, God is not pleased with those who are defiant","9:97":"The Arabs of the desert are more stark in disbelief and hypocrisy, and more likely than not, they know the limits concerning what God has sent down to His messenger, but God is All Knowing, All Wise","9:98":"Some of the desert Arabs look at their payments as a fine, and watch for a disaster to reach you. On them will be the terrible disaster, for God is He Who hears and knows all things","9:99":"But some of the desert Arabs believe in God and the Last Day, and look at their payment as a pious gift bringing them nearer to God and for obtaining the prayers of the messenger. Yes, indeed it brings them closer. Soon God will admit them to His mercy, for God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","9:100":"The forerunners are the first of those who abandoned their homes, those who gave them aid, and those who follow them in good deeds. Well-pleased is God with them, as are they with Him. He has prepared for them gardens through which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That is the greatest accomplishment","9:101":"Some of the desert Arabs around you are hypocrites, as well as those among the residents of Medina. They persist in hypocrisy. You do not know them, but We know them. Twice will We punish them, and they will be sent to a terrible penalty","9:102":"Others have acknowledged their wrongdoing. They have mixed an act that was beneficial with another that was harmful. Perhaps God will turn to them, for God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","9:103":"Of their wealth, accept contributions from them, that you might refine them and cause them increase, and pray on their behalf. Indeed your prayers are a source of peace for them, and God is One Who hears and knows","9:104":"Do they not know that God accepts repentance from His devotees and receives their contributions, and that God is indeed the Oft-Returning, the Merciful Redeemer","9:105":"And say, “Strive, and soon will God acknowledge your striving, as will His messenger and the believers. Soon you will be brought back to the Knower of what is hidden and what is open. Then He will show you the truth of all that you did.”","9:106":"There are others held in suspense by the command of God, whether He punishes them, or turns to them in mercy, God is All Knowing, All Wise","9:107":"And there are those who establish a masjid by way of wrong and rejection, to divide the believers, and for those who warred against God and His messenger. They will indeed declare that their intentions are nothing but good, but God declares that they are certainly liars","9:108":"Never stand there. For certainly there is a masjid whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety, it is more worthy of your standing. In it are people who love to be refined. And God loves those who refine themselves","9:109":"Which then is best? He who lays his foundation on piety to God and His blessings, or he who lays his foundation on an unstable sand-cliff waiting to collapse? And it will crumble to pieces with him into the fire of hell, and God does not guide people while they do wrong","9:110":"The foundation of those who build it is never free from suspicion in their hearts until their hearts are cut into pieces. And God is All Knowing, All Wise","9:111":"God has purchased from the believers, their persons and their goods, and for this, the garden is theirs. They fight in His cause, they slay and are slain. A promise binding on Him in reality, through the Law, the gospel, and the Quran. And who is more faithful to his covenant than God? So rejoice in the transaction which you have contracted. That is the ultimate achievement","9:112":"Those who turn in repentance, who serve and praise Him, who move about in devotion in the cause of God, who bow down and prostrate themselves in prayer, who encourages good and forbids wrong, and observe the limit set by God, proclaim the good news to these believers","9:113":"It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe, that they should pray for forgiveness for pagans, even if they are family, after it is clear to them that they are companions of the fire","9:114":"And Abraham prayed for his father’s forgiveness, only because of a promise he made to him, but when it became clear to him that he was an enemy to God, he dissociated himself from him, though Abraham was most loving and loyal","9:115":"And God will not mislead a people after He has guided them, in order that He may make clear to them what to be conscious of, for God has knowledge of all things","9:116":"To God belongs the control of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and He takes it. Except for Him, you have neither protector nor helper","9:117":"God turned with favor to the Prophet, the Muhajirs, and the Ansar who followed him in a time of distress. After that, the hearts of some of them nearly strayed, but He turned to them, for He is to them Most Kind, Mercifully Redeeming","9:118":"To the three who were left behind, they felt that the earth was constraining them, even in all its spaciousness. And their souls also seemed to be constraining them. Then they understood that there was no refuge from God, only with Him. Then He turned to them, so that they could repent, for God is Oft-Returning, Mercifully Redeeming","9:119":"O you who believe, be aware of God, and be with those who are authentic","9:120":"It was not fitting for the people of Medina and the Bedouin Arabs of the community to refuse to follow God's messenger, or to prefer their own lives to his. Because nothing could they suffer or do that was not added to their credit as a deed of righteousness, whether they suffered thirst, or fatigue, or hunger, in the cause of God, or trod paths to anger the unbelievers, or received injury from an enemy. God does not cause the reward to be lost, for those who do right","9:121":"Nor could they give anything small or great, nor cut across a valley, but the deed is inscribed to their credit, that God may repay their deeds with the best","9:122":"Nor should the believers go forth all together. A contingent from every deployment should remain behind and devote themselves to understanding the ways of life, that they may advise their people when they return to them, and so that they may stay current","9:123":"O you who believe, fight the unbelievers who are close to you, and let them find resolve in you, and know that God is with those who are conscious of Him","9:124":"Whenever a Surah comes down, some of them say, “Which of you has had his faith increased by it?” Yes, those who believe, their faith has increased and they rejoice","9:125":"But those in whose hearts are a disease, it will add doubt to their doubt, and they will die in a state of unbelief","9:126":"Do they not see that they are challenged every year once or twice? Yet they do not turn in repentance, and they do not review it","9:127":"Whenever a Surah is revealed, they look at each other saying, “Does anyone see you?” Then they turn away, so God has turned their hearts away, for they are a people who do not understand","9:128":"Now there has come to you a messenger from among yourselves. It grieves him that you suffer. He is concerned about you. To the believers he is most kind and merciful","9:129":"But if they turn away say, “God suffices me. There is no god but Him. With Him is my trust, He the Lord of the throne, Supreme.”","10:1":"Alif, Laam, Raa. These are the signs of the Book of Wisdom","10:2":"Is it a matter of wonder to humanity that We have sent Our inspiration to a person from among them? That he should advise humanity, and give the good news to the believers, that they have before their Lord the lofty rank of truth. The unbelievers say, “He is indeed an obvious deceiver.”","10:3":"Indeed your Lord is God, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and is firmly established on the throne, regulating and governing all things. No intercessor can plead with Him, except after He gives permission. This is God your Lord, therefore serve Him. Will you not remember this","10:4":"To Him will all of you return. The promise of God is true and sure. It is He Who begins the process of creation and repeats it, that He may reward with justice those who believe and work righteousness. But those who reject Him will have drinks of boiling fluids, and a penalty terrible because they rejected Him","10:5":"It is He Who made the Sun to be a shining light, and the Moon to be a reflected light, and measured out stages for it, that you might know the number of years by counting. God did not create this except in truth and righteousness. He explains His signs in detail, for those who understand","10:6":"Indeed in the alternation of the night and the day, and in all that God has created in the heavens and the earth, are signs for those who are conscious","10:7":"Those who do not rest their hope on their meeting with Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present, and those who do not heed Our signs","10:8":"Their abode is the fire. This is the misery they earned","10:9":"Those who believe, and work righteousness, their Lord will guide them because of their faith. Beneath them will flow rivers in gardens of bliss","10:10":"Their cry will be, “Glory to You, O God.” And “Peace” will be their greeting, and the end of their prayer will be, “Praise God, Lord of all the worlds.”","10:11":"If God were to hasten for humanity the wrong they have earned, as they would have hastened on the good, then would their respite be settled at once. But We leave in their trespasses those who refuse to rest their hope on their meeting with Us, wandering in distraction","10:12":"When trouble touches a person, they pray to Us lying down on their side, sitting, or standing. But when We have solved their problem, they go on as if they had never prayed to Us for the trouble that touched them. Thus the deeds of transgressors seem fair in their eyes","10:13":"Generations before you We caused to perish when they did wrong. Their messengers came to them with clear signs, but they would not believe. This is how We repay those who do wrong","10:14":"Then We made you heirs in the land after them, to see how you would behave","10:15":"But when Our clear signs are rehearsed to them, those who do not rest their hope on their meeting with Us say, “Bring us a reading other than this, or change this.” Say, “It is not for me, of my own volition, to change it. I follow nothing but what is revealed to me. If I were to ignore my Lord, I should myself fear the penalty of a great and dreadful day.”","10:16":"Say, “If God had so willed, I should not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. A whole lifetime before this have I lived among you. Will you not then believe?”","10:17":"Who does more wrong than one who forges a lie against God, or deny His signs? But never will succeed, those who are corrupt","10:18":"They serve besides God, things that cannot hurt them nor profit them, and they say, “These are our intercessors with God.” Say, “Do you indeed inform God of something He does not know of, in the heavens or on earth? Glory be to Him, and far is He above the partners they ascribe.”","10:19":"Humanity was once one people, and then became diverse. Had it not been for a word that went forth before from your Lord, their differences would have been settled between them","10:20":"They say, “Why is not a sign sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, “The unknown is only for God. But wait, I too will wait with you.”","10:21":"When We make humanity taste mercy after adversity has touched them, behold, they take to planning against Our signs. Say, “Faster to plan is God.” Indeed Our messengers record all the plans that you make","10:22":"He is the One Who enables you to traverse through land and sea. Then when you board ships, they sail with them with a favorable wind, and they rejoice. But then comes a stormy wind, and the waves come to them from all sides, and when they think they are being overwhelmed they cry to God sincerely, offering their devotion to Him saying, “If you deliver us from this, we will truly show our gratitude.”","10:23":"But when He delivers them, behold, they transgress insolently through the earth in defiance of right. O humanity, your insolence is against your own souls, and though you may enjoy the life of the present, in the end, you will return to Us and We will show you the truth of all that you did","10:24":"The likeness of the life of the present is as the rain which We send down from the skies. By its mingling, arises the produce of the earth which provides food for humanity and animals. It grows until the earth is clad with its golden ornaments and is beautified. The people to whom it belongs think they have power of disposal over it. Then it reaches Our command by night or by day, and We make it like a harvest clean-mown, as if it had not flourished only the day before. Thus do We explain the signs in detail for those who reflect","10:25":"But God calls to the home of peace. He guides whom He pleases to a way that is straight","10:26":"To those who do right is good indeed, more and more. Neither darkness nor shame will cover their faces. They are companions of the garden, and they will live therein forever","10:27":"But those who have earned misery will have a reward of like misery. Disgrace will cover them. No defender will they have from God. Their faces will be covered, as with pieces from the depth of the darkness of night. They are companions of the fire. They will dwell therein forever","10:28":"One day We will gather them all together. Then We will say to those who joined gods with Us, “To your place. You and those you joined as partners.” We will separate them, and their partners will say, “It was not us that you worshipped","10:29":"“Enough is God for a witness between us and you. We certainly knew nothing of your worship of us.”","10:30":"There will every soul be put to trial for every deed they did. They will be brought back to God, their rightful Lord, and that which they made up will leave them","10:31":"Say, “Who is it that sustains you from the sky and from the earth? And who is it that has power over hearing and sight? And who is it that brings the living from the dead, and the dead from the living? And who is it that rules and regulates all affairs?” They will soon say, “God.” Say, “Will you not then be regardful?”","10:32":"Such is God your true Lord. Apart from truth what remains but error? How then are you turned away","10:33":"So the word of your Lord is proved true against those who rebel, indeed they will not believe","10:34":"Say, “Of your partners, can any originate creation and repeat it?” Say, “It is God Who originates creation and repeats it. So how are you deluded?”","10:35":"Say, “Of your partners, are there any that can give any guidance towards truth?” Say, “It is God Who gives guidance towards truth. Then is He Who gives guidance to truth more worthy to be followed, or he who finds no guidance unless he is guided? What then is the matter with you, and oh how you judge?”","10:36":"But most of them follow nothing but their desire, and truly desire can be of no avail against truth. Indeed God is well aware of all that they do","10:37":"This Quran could not be produced by any other than God. It is a reflection of the truth that came before it, and an explanation of the Bible, it is no doubt from the Guardian Evolver of all the systems of knowledge","10:38":"Or do they say, “He fabricated it?” Say, “Well, bring a Surah like it, and call anyone you can, besides God, if you speak the truth.”","10:39":"No, they charge with falsehood him whose knowledge they cannot encompass, even before the understanding of it has reached them. And those before them made similar charges of falsehood. Then consider what the end of those who did wrong was","10:40":"Of them, there are some who believe in it, and some who do not, and your Lord knows best those who are out to do wrong","10:41":"If they charge you with falsehood say, “My deeds to me, and yours to you. You are free from responsibility for what I do, and I for what you do.”","10:42":"Among them are some who hear you, but can you cause the deaf to hear when they are without understanding","10:43":"And among them are some who look at you, but can you guide the blind when they will not see","10:44":"Indeed God will not deal unjustly with people. It is the people who wrong their own selves","10:45":"One day He will gather them together as if they had stayed but an hour of a day. They will recognize each other. Surely those will be lost who denied the meeting with God, and refused to receive true guidance","10:46":"Whether We show you some part of what We promise them, or We take your soul beforehand, in any case, to Us is their return. And God is witness to all that they do","10:47":"For every people is a messenger, and when their messenger comes, the matter will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged","10:48":"They say, “When will this promise come to pass, if you speak the truth?”","10:49":"Say, “I have no power over any harm or profit even to myself, except as God wills. To every people is a term appointed. When their term is reached, not an hour can they delay it or advance it.”","10:50":"Say, “Do you see that if His punishment should come to you by night or by day, what portion of it would those who are corrupt wish to hasten","10:51":"“Would you then believe in it at last, when it actually comes to pass as you wanted to hasten it?”","10:52":"“Then it will be said to the wrongdoers, ‘Taste the enduring punishment. You get only the reward you earned.’ ”","10:53":"They ask you, “Is that true?” Say, “Yes, by my Lord, it is true, and you cannot escape it.”","10:54":"Every soul that has sinned, if it could possess all that is on earth, could not give it in ransom. They would declare repentance when they see the penalty, but the judgment between them will be with justice, and no wrong will be done to them","10:55":"Is it not that to God belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth? Is it not that God's promise is surely true? Yet most of them do not understand","10:56":"It is He Who gives life and takes it, and to Him will you all be brought back","10:57":"O humanity, there has come to you direction from your Lord and healing for your hearts. And for those who believe, it is guidance and mercy","10:58":"Say, “In the bounty of God, and in His mercy, in those let them rejoice.” That is better than what they hoard","10:59":"Say, “See what God has sent down to you for sustenance? Yet you hold forbidden some of it and some things permissible.” Say, “Has God indeed permitted you to do this, or do you create things to attribute to God.”","10:60":"And what do they think, those who invent lies against God, of the Day of Accountability? Indeed God is full of bounty to humanity, but most of them are ungrateful","10:61":"In whatever activity you may be engaged, and whatever portion you may be reciting from the Quran, and whatever deed you may be doing, We witness it, when you are deeply engaged in it. Nothing is hidden from your Lord, not even something the weight of an atom on the earth or in heaven. The least and the greatest of these things are recorded in a clear record","10:62":"Behold, on the friends of God there is no fear, nor will they grieve","10:63":"Those who believe and guard against wrong","10:64":"For them is good news, in the life of the present and in the hereafter. No change can there be in the words of God. This is indeed the ultimate accomplishment","10:65":"Do not let their speech grieve you. All power and honor belong to God. It is He Who hears and knows all things","10:66":"Behold, to God belong all creatures in the heavens and on earth. What do they follow, those who worship as His partners things other than God? They follow nothing but their desires, and they do nothing but lie","10:67":"He is the One Who has made for you the night that you may rest therein, and the day to make things visible, indeed in this are signs for those who listen","10:68":"They say, “God has taken a son, glory is to him.” No, He is Self-Sufficient. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. No permission do you have for this. Do you say about God what you know not","10:69":"Say, “Those who create a lie against God will never prosper.”","10:70":"They will find enjoyment in the present, then to Us will be their return, and then will We make them taste the severest penalty for their blasphemy","10:71":"Relate to them the story of Noah. Behold, he said to his people, “O my people, if it is hard on you that I should stay and commemorate the signs of God, and that I put my trust in God, then get an agreement about your plan from among your partners. Your plan is dark and dubious, and pass your sentence on me, and give me no respite","10:72":"“But if you turn away, no reward have I asked of you. My reward is only due from God, and I have been asked to be of those who submit to God's will.”","10:73":"They rejected Him, but We delivered him, and those with him in the Ark. And We made them inheritors, while We overwhelmed in the flood those who rejected Our signs. Then see what the end of those who were warned was","10:74":"Then after him, We sent messengers to their peoples. They brought them clear signs, but they would not believe in what they had already rejected beforehand. Thus do We seal the hearts of the transgressors","10:75":"Then after them, We sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his nomarchs with Our signs, but they were arrogant. They were a corrupt people","10:76":"When the truth came to them from Us, they said, “These are indeed lies.”","10:77":"Said Moses, “Say this about the truth when it has reached you? Are lies like this? And those who lie will not prosper.”","10:78":"They said, “Have you come to us to turn us away from the ways we found our parents following, in order that you and your brother may have greatness in the land? We will not believe you two.”","10:79":"Said Pharaoh, “Bring me every illusionist well-versed.”","10:80":"When the illusionists came, Moses said to them, “Throw you what you wish to throw.”","10:81":"Once they had thrown, Moses said, “What you have brought are illusions. God will surely make it of no effect, for God causes not to prosper the work of those who do wrong","10:82":"“And God, by His words, does prove and establish His truth, however much those who are corrupt may hate it.”","10:83":"But none believed in Moses except offspring of his people, because of the fear of Pharaoh and his nomarchs, lest they should persecute them, and certainly, Pharaoh was mighty on the earth, and one who transgressed all bounds","10:84":"Moses said, “O my people, if you do believe in God, then put your trust in Him, if you are Muslims.”","10:85":"They said, “In God we trust.” Our Lord, make us not a trial for those who oppress","10:86":"“And remove us, by Your mercy, from those who reject You.”","10:87":"We inspired Moses and his brother with this message, “Provide houses for your people in Egypt, make your houses into places of worship, and establish prayer, and give good news to those who believe.”","10:88":"Moses prayed, “Our Lord, You have indeed bestowed on Pharaoh and his nomarchs splendor and wealth in the life of the present, and Our Lord, they mislead the people from Your path. Deface, Our Lord, the features of their wealth, and send hardness to their hearts, so that they will not believe until they see the terrible penalty.”","10:89":"God said, “Accepted is your prayer. So stand straight, and do not follow the path of those who know not.”","10:90":"We took the Children of Israel across the sea. Pharaoh and his legions followed them in insolence and spite. Then, when overwhelmed with the flood he said, “I believe that there is no god except Him Whom the Children of Israel believe in. I am of the Muslims.”","10:91":"“Ah, but a little while ago you were in rebellion, and you did wrong","10:92":"“This day will We preserve your body, that you may be a sign to those who come after you. But indeed many among humanity are heedless of Our signs.”","10:93":"We settled the Children of Israel in a beautiful dwelling-place, and provided for them sustenance of the best. It was after knowledge had been granted to them that they fell into disagreements, indeed God will judge between them as to the disagreements among them, on the Day of Accountability","10:94":"If you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Book before you. The truth has indeed come to you from your Lord. So be in no way of those in doubt","10:95":"Nor be among those who reject the signs of God, or you will become one of those who perish","10:96":"Those whom the word of your Lord, predicted would refuse to believe","10:97":"Even if every sign was brought to them, until they see the terrible penalty","10:98":"Why was there not a single township that believed? Its faith would have profited it. Except the people of Jonah, when they believed, We removed from them the penalty of disgrace in the life of the present, and permitted them much enjoyment","10:99":"If it had been your Lord’s will, they would all have believed, all who are on earth. Will you then compel the people against their will to believe","10:100":"No soul can believe, except by the will of God, and He will place doubt on those who do not wish to understand","10:101":"Say, “Behold, all that is in the heavens and on earth,” but neither signs nor warners profit those who believe not","10:102":"Do they then expect anything other than what happened in the days of people who passed away before them? Say, “Then wait, I will wait with you.”","10:103":"In the end, We deliver Our messengers and those who believe. Thus, it is fitting on Our part that We should deliver those who believe","10:104":"Say, “O you people, if you are in doubt as to my way, I worship not what you worship other than God. I worship God, Who will take your souls. I am asked to be of the believers","10:105":"“And set your face towards the way with true piety, and never, in any way, be of the unbelievers","10:106":"“Nor call on any other than God. Such will neither profit you nor harm you. If you do, behold, you will certainly be of those who do wrong.”","10:107":"If God inflicts you with pain, there are none that can remove it but Him. If He designs some benefit for you, there is none that can keep back His favor. He causes it to reach whomever of His servants He pleases, and He is the Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","10:108":"Say, “O you people, truth has reached you from your Lord. Those who receive guidance do so for the good of their own souls, those who stray, do so to their own detriment, and I am not put over you to arrange your affairs.”","10:109":"Follow the inspiration sent to you, and be patient and constant until God decides, for He is the best to decide","11:1":"Alif, Laam, Raa. A book with verses of wisdom, further explained in detail, from the One who is Most Wise and All Aware","11:2":"Should you worship any other than God? Say, “Indeed I am sent to you from Him to warn and to bring good news","11:3":"“Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, so that He may grant you good enjoyment for a term appointed, and bestow His abundant grace on all who have abundant merit.

Even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal, and what they reveal, for He knows the heart well. 5 (End of Part)","11:6":"There is no moving creature on earth whose sustenance does not depend on God. He knows the time and place of its activity and its place of rest. All is in a clear record","11:7":"He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and His throne was over the waters, so that He would make evident which of you is best in conduct. But if you were to say to them, “You will indeed be raised up after death,” the unbelievers would be sure to say, “This is nothing but obvious delusion.”","11:8":"If We delay the penalty for them for a definite term, they are sure to say, “What keeps it back?” On the day it reaches them, nothing will keep it back, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock","11:9":"If We give a man a taste of mercy from Ourselves, and then withdraw it from him, behold, he is in despair and falls into blasphemy","11:10":"But if We give him a taste of Our favors after adversity has touched him, he is sure to say, “All problems have left me.” Behold, he falls into exultation and pride","11:11":"Not so do those who show patience and constancy, and work righteousness, for them is forgiveness and a great reward","11:12":"Perhaps you may want to give up a part of what is revealed to you, and your heart feels distressed when they say, “Why is a treasure not sent down to him, or why does an angel not come down with him?” But you are there only to warn, God manages everything","11:13":"Or they may say, “He fabricated it.” Say, “Bring then ten Surahs fabricated like it, and call whoever you can, other than God, if you speak the truth","11:14":"If then they do not answer you, know that this revelation is sent down with the knowledge of God, and that there is no god but He. Will you then submit?”","11:15":"Those who desire the life of the present and its glitter, we will pay them for their deeds, without diminishment","11:16":"They are those for whom there is nothing in the hereafter but the fire. Vain are the designs which they drafted, and of no effect are the deeds that they do","11:17":"Can they be like those who accept guidance from their Lord, and who a witness from Himself teaches, as did the Book of Moses before it? For it was a guide and a mercy. They believe in it. But those of the sects who reject it, the fire will be their promised meeting place. So do not be in doubt, for it is the truth from your Lord. Yet many among humanity do not believe","11:18":"Who does more wrong than those who invent a lie against God? They will be turned back to the presence of their Lord, and the witnesses will say, “These are the ones who lied about their Lord. Behold, the curse of God is on those who do wrong","11:19":"“Those who would hinder people from the path of God and would seek in it something crooked, these were those who denied the hereafter.”","11:20":"They will in no way escape His design on earth, nor have they protectors besides God. Their penalty will be doubled. They lost the power to hear, and they could not see","11:21":"They are the ones who have lost themselves, and the desires they invented have abandoned them","11:22":"Without a doubt, these are the very ones who will lose most in the hereafter","11:23":"But those who believe and work righteousness, and humble themselves before their Lord, they will be companions of Paradise, and will dwell therein forever","11:24":"These two types of people can be compared to the blind and deaf, and those who can see and hear. Are they equal when compared? Will you not then take notice","11:25":"We sent Noah to his people, “I have come to you with clear advice,”","11:26":"“That you should serve none but God, and indeed I fear for you the penalty of a terrible day.”","11:27":"But the leaders of the unbelievers among his people said, “We see you as nothing but a human being like ourselves. And the only ones we see following you are the lowest among us, with immature judgment. Nor do we see in you any merit above us. In fact we think you are liars.”","11:28":"He said, “O my people, do you see that I have guidance from my Lord, and that He has sent mercy to me from His own presence, and that the mercy escapes you? Can we compel you to accept it when you have become averse to it","11:29":"“And O my people, I ask you for no wealth in return. My reward is from none but God, but I will not drive away those who believe, for indeed they are to meet their Lord, and you, I see as the ignorant ones","11:30":"“And O my people, who would help me against God if I drove them away? Will you not then take heed","11:31":"“I do not tell you that with me are the treasures of God, nor do I know what is hidden, nor do I claim to be an angel, nor do I say of those whom your eyes despise that God will not grant them all that is good. God knows best what is in their souls. I would, if I did, indeed be a wrongdoer.”","11:32":"They said, “O Noah, you have disputed with us long enough. Now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you speak the truth.”","11:33":"He said, “Truly God will bring it on you if He wills, and then you will not be able to stop it","11:34":"“Of no profit will my advice be to you, as much as I desire to give you advice, if God wills to leave you astray. It is He Who is your Lord, and to Him will you return.”","11:35":"Or do they say, “He has fabricated it”? Say, “If I had fabricated it, on me is my sin, and I am free of the sins of which you are guilty","11:36":"It was revealed to Noah, “None of your people will believe except those who have already believed. So grieve no longer over their wrongful deeds","11:37":"“But construct an ark under Our eyes and Our inspiration, and address Me no further on behalf of those who do wrong, for they will soon be overwhelmed.”","11:38":"Immediately, he starts constructing the Ark. Every time the leaders of his people passed by him, they threw ridicule on him. He said, “If you ridicule us now, we will likewise look down on you with ridicule","11:39":"“But soon will you know on whom will descend a penalty that will cover them with shame, and on whom will be unleashed a lasting penalty.”","11:40":"Then behold, there came Our command, and the fountains of the earth gushed forth. We said, “Embark therein, two of each kind, male and female, and your family, except those against whom the word has already gone forth, and the believers.” But only a few believed with him","11:41":"So he said, “Embark on the Ark with the name of God, whether it move or be at rest, for my Lord is surely Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming.”","11:42":"So the Ark floated with them on the waves, and Noah called out to his son who had separated himself from them, “O my son, embark with us, and be not with the unbelievers.”","11:43":"The son replied, “I will take myself to some mountain. It will save me from the water.” Noah said, “This day nothing can be saved from the command of God, none except those on whom He has mercy, “And the waves came between them, and the son was among those overwhelmed in the flood","11:44":"Then the word came forth, “O earth, swallow up your water, and O sky, withhold your water.” And the water subsided, and the event ended. The Ark rested on Mount Judi, and the word came forth, “Away with those who do wrong.”","11:45":"And Noah called upon his Lord and said, “O my Lord, surely my son is of my family, and Your promise is true, and You are the Most Just of Judges.”","11:46":"He said, “O Noah, he is not of your family, for his conduct is unrighteous. So ask not of Me that of which you cannot know. I give you counsel, lest you should act like the ignorant.”","11:47":"Noah said, “O my Lord, I do seek refuge with You, lest I ask You for that of which I cannot understand, and unless You forgive me and have mercy on me, I will indeed be lost.”","11:48":"The word came, “O Noah, come down with peace and those with you, some to whom We will grant their desires, but in the end, a terrible penalty will reach them from Us.”","11:49":"Such are some of the stories of the unknown which We have revealed to you. Before this, neither you nor your people knew them. So persevere patiently, for the end is for those who are righteous","11:50":"To the ‘Ad people We sent Hud, one of their own brothers. He said, “O my people, worship God, you have no other god but Him. You do nothing but create the others","11:51":"“O my people, I ask of you no reward for this. My reward is from none but He who created me. Will you not then understand","11:52":"“And O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him.

Do you forbid us the worship of what our parents worshipped?

Indeed you know quite well what we want.”","11:80":"He said, “I wish that I had power to suppress you, or that I could go to some great refuge.”","11:81":"The messengers said, “O Lot, we are messengers from your Lord. By no means will they reach you, now travel with your family while a part of the night still remains, and let not any of you look back, but your wife will remain behind. What will happen to her is what happened to others. Morning is their time appointed, and is not the morning near?”","11:82":"When Our decree issued, We turned them upside down, and rained down on them brimstone hard as baked clay, spread layer on layer","11:83":"Marked from your Lord, nor is this ever far from those who do wrong","11:84":"To the Madyan people We sent Shu’aib, one of their own brothers. He said, “O my people, worship God, you have no other god but Him, and give not short measure or weight. I see you in prosperity, but I fear for you the penalty of a day that will encompass all","11:85":"“And O my people, give just measure and weight, nor withhold from the people the things that are their due. And do not cause harm in the land with intent to do wrong","11:86":"“That which has left you, by God, is best for you if you believe, but I am not put over you to keep watch.”","11:87":"They said, “O Shu’aib, does your prayer ask that we abandon the worship that our parents practiced, or that we stop doing what we like with our property? Truly you are forbearing and right-minded.”","11:88":"He said, “O my people, do you see whether I have guidance from my Lord, and whether He has given me good provisions from Himself? I do not wish, in opposition to you, to do that which I forbid you to do. I only desire your betterment to the best of my ability, but my success can only come from God, in Him I trust, and I look to Him","11:89":"“And O my people, do not let my dissent cause you to sin, lest you suffer a fate similar to that of the people of Noah, Hud, or Salih, nor are the people of Lot far off from you","11:90":"“But ask forgiveness from your Lord, and turn to Him, for my Lord is indeed full of mercy and love.”","11:91":"They said, “O Shu’aib, much of what you say we do not understand, and compared to us we see that you have no strength. Were it not for your family, we would certainly have stoned you, for you have among us no great position.”","11:92":"He said, “O my people, is my family of more concern to you than God, for you cast Him away behind your backs, but indeed my Lord encompasses, on all sides, all that you do","11:93":"“And O my people do whatever you can. I will do my part. Soon you will know who it is on whom descends the penalty of disgrace, and who is a liar, and watch, I too am watching with you.”","11:94":"When Our decree issued, We saved Shu’aib and those who believed with him, with mercy from Ourselves, but the mighty blast seized the wrongdoers, and they lay prostrate in their homes","11:95":"As if they had never lived and flourished there. Behold, how the Madyan were removed, as were removed the Thamud","11:96":"And we sent Moses with guidance and an authority manifest","11:97":"To Pharaoh and his nomarchs, but they followed the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was not the right guide","11:98":"He will go before his people on the Day of Accountability, and lead them into the fire, and terrible indeed will be the place to which they are led","11:99":"And they are followed by a curse in this life and on the Day of Accountability, and terrible is the gift which will be given to them","11:100":"These are some of the stories about societies which We relate to you. Of them, some are standing, and some have fallen","11:101":"It was not Us Who wronged them, they wronged their own souls, and the deities other than God whom they invoked profited them nothing when there issued the decree of your Lord, nor did they add anything but perdition","11:102":"Such is the chastisement of your Lord. When He chastises societies in the middle of their wrong, terrible indeed and severe is His chastisement","11:103":"In that is a sign for those who are aware of the penalty of the hereafter. That is a day for which humanity will be gathered together. That will be a day of testimony","11:104":"Nor will We delay it, except for a while","11:105":"The day it arrives, no soul will speak except by His permission. Of those, some will feel agony and some will feel blessed","11:106":"Those in agony will be in the fire. There will be for them therein the sound of moans and sobs","11:107":"They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills, for your Lord accomplishes what He wills","11:108":"And those who are blessed will be in the garden. They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills, a gift without pause","11:109":"So do not be in doubt as to what these people worship. They worship nothing but what their parents worshipped before them, but indeed We will pay them back their portion without reduction","11:110":"We certainly gave the Book to Moses, but differences arose. Had it not been that a word had gone forth before from your Lord, the matter would have been decided between them, but they are in suspicious doubt concerning it","11:111":"And indeed your Lord will pay everyone back for all of their deeds, for He knows well all that they do","11:112":"Therefore stand firm as you are asked, you and those with you who respond, and do not transgress, for He sees well all that you do","11:113":"And do not incline to those who do wrong, or the fire will seize you, and you have no protectors other than God, nor will you be helped","11:114":"And establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approaches of the night, for those things that are good repel those that are harmful. That is a saying to remember for those who want to remember","11:115":"And be steadfast with patience, for indeed God will not cause the reward of the righteous to perish","11:116":"Why were there not among the generations before you, people of balance and good sense, prohibiting the people from doing wrong on the earth, except a few among them whom We saved? But the wrongdoers pursued the enjoyment of the good things in life which was given to them, and persisted in harmful deeds","11:117":"Nor would your Lord be the One to destroy communities for a single wrongdoing, if its members were likely to repent","11:118":"If your Lord had so willed, He could have made humanity one people, but they will not cease to dispute","11:119":"Except those on whom your Lord has bestowed His mercy, and for this He created them, and the word of your Lord will be fulfilled, “I will fill hell with jinn and humans all together.”","11:120":"All of what we relate to you of the stories of the messengers is for Us to make your heart firm with it. In them, there comes to you the truth, as well as an exhortation and a message of remembrance to those who believe","11:121":"Say to those who do not believe, “Do whatever you can. We will do our part","11:122":"“And wait. We too will wait.”","11:123":"To God belongs the unknown of the heavens and the earth, and to Him every affair goes back. Then worship Him, and put your trust in Him, and your Lord is not unmindful of anything that you do","12:1":"Alif, Laam, Raa. These are the symbols of the Clear Book","12:2":"We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran, in order that you may learn wisdom","12:3":"We relate to you the most beautiful of stories, in that We reveal to you this Quran. Before this, you too were among those who knew it not","12:4":"Behold, Joseph said to his father, “O my father, I saw eleven stars and the Sun and the Moon, I saw them prostrate themselves to me.”","12:5":"He said, “My son, do not share your vision with your brothers, lest they make a plan against you, for Satan is to humanity a sworn enemy","12:6":"“Thus will your Guardian Evolver choose you and teach you the interpretation of stories and events, and perfect His favor on you and on the posterity of Jacob, even as He perfected it to your fathers Abraham and Isaac, for God is full of knowledge and wisdom.”","12:7":"Indeed in Joseph and his brothers are signs for seekers","12:8":"They said, “Truly Joseph and his brother are loved more by our father than we are, though we are an excellent group. Indeed our father is clearly in error","12:9":"“Slay Joseph or cast him out to some unknown land, so the favor of your father may be given to you alone. There will be enough time for you to be righteous after that.”","12:10":"One of them said, “Do not slay Joseph, but if you must do something, throw him down to the bottom of the well. He will be picked up by some caravan of travelers.”","12:11":"They said, “O our father, why do you not trust us with Joseph, seeing we are indeed his sincere well-wishers","12:12":"“Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and we will take care of him.”","12:13":"Jacob said, “Really it saddens me that you should take him away. I fear the wolf should devour him while you are not watching him.”","12:14":"They said, “If the wolf were to devour him while we are such a large group, then we would indeed have also perished.”","12:15":"So they took him away, and they all threw him down to the bottom of the well, and We put into his heart this message, “Indeed you will tell them the truth about this act of theirs, while they know you not.”","12:16":"Then they came to their father in the early part of the night, weeping","12:17":"They said, “O our father, we went racing with one another, and left Joseph with our things, and the wolf devoured him, but you will never believe us even though we tell the truth.”","12:18":"They stained his shirt with fake blood. He said, “No, your minds have made up a tale that may pass with you, but for me patience is most fitting against that which you assert, it is only God Whose help can be sought.”","12:19":"Then there came a caravan of travelers. They sent their water-carrier to the well, and he let down his bucket. He said, “Look here, good news. Here is a young man.” So they hid him like merchandise, but God knows well all that they do","12:20":"They sold him for a miserable price, for a few coins counted out. In such low estimation did they hold him","12:21":"The man in Egypt who bought him said to his wife, “Make his stay honorable. Maybe he will bring us much good, or we will take him as a son.” Thus did We establish Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of stories and events, and God has full power and control over His affairs, but most among humanity do not know","12:22":"When Joseph reached maturity, We gave him power and knowledge. Thus do We reward those who do right","12:23":"But she in whose house he stayed, sought to seduce him from himself. She locked the doors and said, “Come now.” He said, “God forbid, truly he is my lord. He made my sojourn comfortable. Truly no good comes to those who do wrong.”","12:24":"And indeed she desired him, and he would have desired her, but he saw the evidence of his Lord, so that We might avert from him harm, and immorality, for he was one of Our servants, sincere and innocent","12:25":"So they both raced each other to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back. The two found her lord near the door. She said, “What is the punishment for one who committed a wrongful act against your wife, only prison or some other terrible chastisement?”","12:26":"He said, “It was she who sought to seduce me from myself.” Then one from her household saw this and bore witness, “If it be that his shirt is torn from the front, then her story is true, and he is a liar","12:27":"“But if it be that his shirt is torn from the back, then she is the liar, and he is telling the truth.”","12:28":"So when he saw that his shirt was torn from the back her husband said, “Indeed the seduction was yours, truly extreme is your deception","12:29":"“O Joseph, pass this over. O wife, ask forgiveness for your wrong, for truly you have been at fault.”","12:30":"The ladies in the city said, “The wife of the great Aziz has sought to seduce her slave from himself. Truly he has inspired her with violent love. We see she is evidently going astray.”","12:31":"When she heard of their gossip, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them. She gave each of them a knife and said, “Come out before them.” When they saw him, they applauded him, and cut their hands. They said, “God preserve us, no mortal is this, this is none other than a noble angel.”","12:32":"She said, “There before you is the man for whom you blamed me. I did seek to seduce him from himself but he firmly saved himself guiltless, and now, if he does not as I wish, he will certainly be cast into prison, and be of the company of the hardest.”","12:33":"He said, “O my Lord, the prison is more to my liking than that which they invite me. Unless You turn away their temptation from me, I should feel inclined towards them and join the ranks of the ignorant.”","12:34":"So his Lord responded to him, and turned away their temptation from him, indeed He hears and knows all things","12:35":"Then it occurred to the people, after they had seen the signs, to imprison him for a time","12:36":"With him there came into the prison two young people. One of them said, “I see myself pressing wine.” Said the other, “I see myself carrying bread on my head, and birds are eating from it. Tell us the true meaning of it, for we see you are one who does right.”","12:37":"He said, “Before any food comes to feed either of you, I will surely reveal to you the truth and meaning of this, and before it befalls you. That is part of the duty which my Lord has taught me. I have abandoned the ways of a people who do not believe in God and who deny the hereafter","12:38":"“And I follow the ways of my forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and never could we attribute any partners to God. That is from the grace of God to us and to humanity, yet most people are not grateful","12:39":"“O my two companions of the prison. Are many lords differing among themselves better, or One God, Supreme and Irresistible","12:40":"“If not Him, you worship nothing but names which you have named, you and your parents, for which God has sent down no authority. The command is for none but God. He has asked that you worship none but Him. That is the right way, but most people do not understand","12:41":"“O my two companions of the prison. As for one of you, he will pour out the wine for his lord to drink. As for the other, he will hang from the cross, and the birds will eat from off his head. So is decreed the matter which you two inquire.”","12:42":"And of the two, to the one who he considers about to be saved he said, “Mention me to your lord.” But Satan made him forget to mention him to his lord, and Joseph lingered in prison a few more years","12:43":"The king said, “I see seven fat cows which seven lean ones devour, and seven green ears of corn, and seven withered. O advisors, explain to me my vision if you can interpret visions.”","12:44":"They said, “A confused medley of dreams, and we are not skilled in the interpretation of dreams.”","12:45":"But the person who had been released, one of the two, now remembered him after a period of time and said, “I will tell you the truth of its interpretation. Bring me","12:46":"“O Joseph, O person of truth, expound to us concerning the seven fat cows that the seven lean ones devour, and the seven green ears of corn and withered ones. That I may return to the people, and that they may understand.”","12:47":"Joseph said, “For seven years you will diligently sow as you will, and the harvests of what you reap, you will leave in the ear, except a little of which you will eat","12:48":"“Then will come after that seven dreadful years which will devour what you will have saved in anticipation for them, all except a little which you will have stored","12:49":"“Then will come after that, a year in which the people will have abundant water, and in which they will use to produce.”","12:50":"So the king said, “Bring him to me.” But when the messenger came to him Joseph said, “Go back to your lord, and ask him what state of mind the ladies who cut their hands is? For my Lord is certainly well aware with their temptation.”","12:51":"The king said to the ladies, “What was your state when you sought to seduce Joseph from himself?” The ladies said, “God preserve us, we do not know anything bad about him.” Said the Aziz’s wife, “Now the truth is manifest. It was I who sought to seduce him from himself. He is indeed of those who are truthful","12:52":"“That in order that he may know that I have never betrayed him in his absence, and that God will never assist the plans of betrayal. (End of Part)","12:53":"“Nor do I absolve myself, though the soul is certainly prone to difficulty, unless my Lord bestows His mercy. But surely my Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming.”","12:54":"So the king said, “Bring him to me, I will appoint him to myself.” Therefore, when he spoke to him he said, “Be assured this day that you are in our presence with ranks firmly established, and integrity fully proven","12:55":"Joseph said, “Appoint me over the treasury of the land. I will indeed guard it as an expert.”","12:56":"Thus We gave power to Joseph in the land to take possession when or where he pleased. We bestow Our mercy on whom We please, and We cause not to be lost, the reward of those who do right","12:57":"But indeed the reward of the hereafter is best for those who believe and are constant in righteousness","12:58":"Then Joseph’s brothers came. They entered his presence and he knew them, but they knew him not","12:59":"And once he supplied their provisions he said, “Bring to me a brother you have, of the same father as you. Do you not see that I give a good amount, and that I provide the best hospitality","12:60":"“Now, if you do not bring him to me, you will no longer receive any amount from me, nor will you even come near me.”","12:61":"They said, “We will certainly seek to get permission concerning him from his father, indeed we will.”","12:62":"And Joseph told members of his staff to put their goods with which they had bartered into their saddlebags so they would find it only when they returned to their people, in order that they might return","12:63":"Now when they returned to their father they said, “O our father, no amount of grain will we get unless you send our brother with us, only then will we receive our measure. We will indeed take every care of him.”","12:64":"He said, “Shall I trust you with him to any end other than when I trusted you with his brother? But God is the best Caretaker, and He is a better redeemer than all who redeem.”","12:65":"Then when they opened their luggage they found their goods had been returned to them and they said, “O our father, what more can we ask for? These goods have been returned to us. We will get food for our family, we will take care of our brother, and add a full camel’s load. This is just a small quantity","12:66":"Jacob said, “Never will I send him with you until you swear a solemn oath to me, in the name of God, that you will indeed bring him back to me, unless you yourselves are captured. Once they swore their solemn oath he said, “Over all that we say, God is Witness and Guardian.”","12:67":"Further he said, “O my sons, do not enter all through one gate. Enter through different gates. Not that I can help you over God. None can determine anything except for God. On Him do I put my trust, and let all who trust, put their trust in Him.”","12:68":"And when they entered in the manner their father had advised, it did not profit them in the least against God. It was only helpful for Jacob’s soul which he carried out. For he was, by our instruction, full of knowledge. But most people do not understand","12:69":"Then when they came into Joseph’s presence, he invited his brother to stay with him. He said to him, “Behold, I am your brother, so do not grieve about any of their doings.”","12:70":"Then when he had given them provisions, he put the drinking cup into his brother’s saddlebag. Then someone shouted, “You in that caravan! Indeed you are thieves!”","12:71":"They said turning towards them, “What is it you miss?”","12:72":"They said, “We miss the great goblet of the king. For him who produces it, is a camel’s load. I will be bound by it.”","12:73":"The brothers said, “By God, you know full well that we did not come to commit crimes in the land, and that we are not thieves.”","12:74":"They said, “What then will be the penalty for this if you are proved to have lied?”","12:75":"They said, “The penalty should be that he in whose saddle-bag it is found should be held to pay for the crime. This is how we punish criminals.”","12:76":"So he began to search their baggage, then he came to the baggage of his brother, and brought it out of his brother’s bag. We planned this for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the law of the king except that God willed it. We raise in degrees who We please. But over all, endued with knowledge is One, All Knowing","12:77":"They said, “He steals. And there was a brother of his who stole before him.” But these things did Joseph keep locked in his heart, not revealing the secrets to them. He said, “You are worse situated, and God knows best the truth of what you assert.”","12:78":"They said, “O exalted one, behold, he has a father who is very old, so take one of us in his place, for we see that you graciously do good.”","12:79":"He said, “God forbids that we take other than him with whom we found our property. Indeed, we would be acting wrongfully","12:80":"Now, when they saw no hope of him changing, they held a conference in private. The eldest among them said, “Do you not know that your father took a promise from you in God's name, and how, before this, you failed in your duty with Joseph? Therefore, I will not leave this land until my father permits me, or God commands me, and He is the best to command","12:81":"“Turn back to your father and say, ‘O our father, behold, your son committed theft. We bear witness only to what we know, and we cannot testify against the unknown","12:82":"“Ask at the town where we have been, and the caravan in which we returned, and you will find that we are indeed telling the truth.”","12:83":"Jacob said, “No, but you have contrived a story for you. Patience is most fitting. Maybe God will bring them to me together, for He is indeed full of knowledge and wisdom.”","12:84":"And he turned away from them and said, “How great is my grief for Joseph.” And his eyes became white with sorrow, and he fell into silence","12:85":"They said, “By God, will you not cease to remember Joseph until you reach the last extremity of illness, or until you die.”","12:86":"He said, “I only complain of my suffering and grief to God, and I learned from God that which you know not","12:87":"“O my sons, go and inquire about Joseph and his brother, and never give up hope of God's mercy. Truly no one despairs of God's mercy, except those who have no faith.”","12:88":"Then when they came back into Joseph’s presence they said, “O exalted one, distress has seized us and our family. We have come with goods of little value. So pay us full measure. Consider it as charity to us, for God rewards the charitable.”","12:89":"He said, “Do you know how you dealt with Joseph and his brother knowingly?”","12:90":"They said, “Are you indeed Joseph?” He said, “I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God has indeed been gracious to us all. Behold, he who is righteous and patient, never will God cause his reward to be lost on those who do right.”","12:91":"They said, “By God, God has indeed preferred you above us, and we certainly have been guilty of wrong.”","12:92":"He said, “This day let no blame be on you. God will forgive you, and He is the Most Redeeming of those who redeem","12:93":"“Go with this, my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father. He will come to see. Then come to me together with all your family.”","12:94":"As the caravan left, their father said, “I indeed smell the presence of Joseph. And do not think that I am weak of mind.”","12:95":"They said, “By God, truly you are in your old wandering mind.”","12:96":"Then when the bearer of the good news came, he cast the shirt over his face, and he immediately regained clear sight. He said, “Did I not say to you, ‘I know from God that which you know not?’ ”","12:97":"They said, “O our father, ask for us forgiveness for our sins, for we are truly at fault.”","12:98":"He said, “Soon will I ask my Lord for forgiveness for you, for he is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming.”","12:99":"Then when they entered the presence of Joseph, he provided a home for his parents with himself and said, “Enter Egypt in peace, if it is the will of God.”","12:100":"And he raised his parents high on the throne, and they all fell down in prostration before him. He said, “O my father, this is the fulfillment of my vision in the past. God has made it come true. He was indeed good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you out of the desert, even after Satan had sown enmity between my brothers and me. Indeed my Lord understands best, the mysteries of all that He plans, for indeed He is full of knowledge and wisdom","12:101":"“O my Lord, You have indeed bestowed on me some power, and taught me something of the interpretation of dreams and events, O Creator of the heavens and the earth, You are my Protector in the present and in the hereafter. Take my soul as one submitting to Your will, and unite me with the righteous.”","12:102":"Such is one of the stories unknown, which We reveal by inspiration to you, nor were you with them when they concerted their plans and while they plotted","12:103":"But most of humanity will not believe, no matter how much you desire it","12:104":"And no reward do you ask of them for this. It is no less than a message for all worlds","12:105":"And how many signs in the heavens and the earth do they pass by? Yet they turn away from them","12:106":"And most of them do not believe in God without associating partners with Him","12:107":"Do they then feel secure from the coming against them of the covering veil of punishment from God, or of the coming against them of the Hour all of a sudden, while they expect it not","12:108":"Say, “This is my way. I invite to God, with evidence as clear as the seeing with one’s eyes, I and whoever follows me. Glory is to God, and never will I join gods with God.”","12:109":"Nor did We send before you any except human beings whom we inspired. People living in human societies. Do they not travel through the earth and see what the end of those before them was? But the home of the hereafter is best for those who do right. Then will you use reason","12:110":"Until the messengers give up hope and think that they are treated as liars, Our help will come to them, and those that We wish to be delivered into safety, will be delivered, but never will our punishment be warded off from those who are in sin","12:111":"There is in their stories instruction for people of understanding. It is not a narrative made up, but a confirmation of that which came before it, a detailed explanation of all things, and a guide and a mercy to people who believe","13:1":"Alif, Laam, Miim, Raa. These are the signs of the Book that has been revealed to you from your Lord as the truth, but most people do not believe","13:2":"God is He who has raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see, and is firmly established on the throne, and He has subjected the Sun and the Moon, each one orbits for a term appointed. He regulates all affairs, and explains the signs in detail, that you may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord","13:3":"And it is He Who has spread out the earth, and set mountains standing firm, and rivers. And fruit of every kind has He made in pairs, two and two. He draws the night as a veil over the day. Behold, in these things are signs for those who reflect","13:4":"And in the earth are tracts neighboring, and gardens of vines and fields sown with corn, and palm trees growing out of a single root or otherwise, watered with the same water, yet some of them We make better than others to eat. Behold, in this are signs for those who understand","13:5":"You are astonished at their saying, “When we are dust, will we indeed be in a new creation?” They are those who deny their Lord. They are those around whose necks will be chains. They will be companions of the fire, to dwell therein forever","13:6":"They ask you to hasten on the wrong in preference to the good, although there has occurred before them exemplary punishments, but indeed your Lord is full of forgiveness to humanity for their wrongdoing, but indeed your Lord is also strict in punishment","13:7":"And the unbelievers say, “Why is a sign not sent down to him from his Lord?” But you are truly a warner, and to every people a guide","13:8":"God knows what every pregnant female bears, and by how much the wombs fall short or exceeds. Everything is before His sight in proportion","13:9":"He knows the unknown and that which is open. He is the Great, the Most High","13:10":"It is the same whether any of you conceal his speech or declare it openly, whether he lie hidden by night or goes out freely by day","13:11":"For each there are others in succession before and behind him. They guard him by command of God. Certainly God will never change the condition of a people until they change themselves. But when God wills a people’s punishment, there can be no turning it back, nor will they find besides Him any to protect","13:12":"It is He Who shows you the lightning by way of fear and of hope. It is He Who raises up the clouds, heavy with rain","13:13":"And thunder repeats His praises, as do the angels with awe. He sends the thunderbolts, and with it He strikes whomever He wills. Yet there are people who dispute about God, even with the strength of His power","13:14":"To Him belongs prayer in truth. Any others who they call upon besides Him hear them no more than if they were to stretch out their hands for water to reach their mouth but it reaches it not, for the prayer of those without faith is nothing but error","13:15":"Whatever beings there are in the heavens and the earth, prostrate themselves to God with good will or in spite of themselves. As do their shadows in the morning and evenings","13:16":"Say, “Who is the Guardian Evolver of the heavens and the earth?” Say, “God”. And say, “Do you then take protectors other than Him, those who have no power themselves to either benefit or to do harm?” Say, “Are the blind equal to those who see?

Neither say your Salat loudly, nor say it in a low tone, but seek a way in between.”","17:111":"Say, “Praise God, who does not have a son, and has no partner in His control, nor does He need any to protect Him out of weakness. Yes, exalt Him for His Greatness and Glory.”","18:1":"Praise God, Who has sent to His servant the Book, and has allowed therein no crookedness","18:2":"No, only that which is straight. In order that He may warn of a terrible punishment from Him, and that He may give hope to the believers who work righteous deeds, that they will have an excellent reward","18:3":"Where they will remain forever","18:4":"Further, that He may warn those who say, “God has a son.”","18:5":"They have no knowledge of such a thing, nor had their ancestors. It is a terrible thing that issues from their mouths as a saying which is nothing but falsehood","18:6":"You would only worry yourself to death, following after them in grief if they do not believe in this message","18:7":"That which is on earth we have made only as a glittering show for the world, in order that We may make evident which of them are best in conduct","18:8":"Indeed that which is on earth We will make as only dust and dry earth","18:9":"Do you reflect that the Companions of the Cave and of the Inscription were wonders among Our signs","18:10":"Behold, the youths retreated to the cave. They said, “Our Lord, bestow on us mercy from Yourself, and manage our affair for us in the right way.”","18:11":"Then We drew a veil over their ears for a number of years while in the cave","18:12":"Then We woke them, in order to make evident which of the two groups were best at calculating the term of years they had stayed","18:13":"We relate to you their story in truth. They were youths who believed in their Guardian Evolver, and We advanced them in guidance","18:14":"We gave strength to their hearts. Behold, they stood up and said, “Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and of the earth. Never will we call upon any god other than Him. If we did, indeed we would have spoken an enormity","18:15":"“Our people have taken for worship gods other than Him. Why do they not bring forward a clear authority for what they do? Who does more wrong than those who invent a lie against God","18:16":"“When you turn away from them and the things they worship other than God, retreat to the cave. Your Lord will shower His mercies on you and manage your affair towards comfort and ease.”","18:17":"You would have seen the Sun when it rose, setting to the right from their cave, and when it set, turning away from them to the left, while they lay in the open space in the middle of the cave. Such are among the signs of God. He whom God guides is rightly guided, but he whom God leaves to stray, for him will you find no protector to lead him to the right way","18:18":"You would have thought them awake, as they slept, and We turned them on their right and on their left sides. Their dog stretching out his two forelegs at the entrance. If you had come up on them, you would have certainly turned back from them in flight, and would certainly have been filled with fear of them","18:19":"So we raised them up, that they might question each other. A voice said, “How long have you stayed here?” They said, “We have stayed a day or part of a day.” They said, “God knows best how long you have stayed here. Now send one of you with this money of yours to the town. Let him find out which is the best food and bring some to you, that you may satisfy your hunger, and let him behave with care and courtesy, and let him not inform anyone about you","18:20":"“Because if they find you, they would stone you or force you to return to their cult, then you will never succeed.”","18:21":"Then We made their story known, that they would understand that the promise of God is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour of Accountability. Behold, they dispute among themselves as to their story. They said, “Construct a building over them.” Their Lord knows best concerning them. Those who would dispute over their affair said, “Let us at least build a place of worship over them.”","18:22":"Some will say they were three, the dog being the fourth among them, others say they were five, the dog being the sixth, doubtfully guessing at the unknown, still others say they were seven, the dog being the eighth. Say, “My Lord knows best their number, it is only a few others who know.” Therefore, do not enter into controversies concerning them, except on a matter that is clear, nor consult any of them about the Sleepers","18:23":"Nor say of anything, “I will be sure to do so and so tomorrow","18:24":"“Without adding, ‘God willing’. And call your Lord to mind when you forget and say, ‘I hope that my Lord will guide me even closer than this to the right way.’ ”","18:25":"So they stayed in their cave three hundred years, plus nine","18:26":"Say, “God knows best how long they stayed. With Him are the secrets of the heavens and the earth. How clearly He sees, how well He hears. They have no protector other than Him, nor does He share His command with anyone.”","18:27":"And recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord. None can change His words, and none will you find as a refuge other than Him","18:28":"And keep your soul content with those who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking His Face, and do not let your eyes pass beyond them, seeking the glitter of this life, nor follow any whose heart We have permitted to neglect the remembrance of Us, one who follows his own desires, whose case has gone beyond all bounds","18:29":"Say, “The truth is from your Lord.” Let them who want to believe, believe. And let them who want to reject it, reject it. For the wrongdoers, We have prepared a fire like the walls and roof of a tent, it will hem them in. If they ask for relief they will be granted water like melted brass which will scald their faces, how dreadful the drink, how miserable a destination","18:30":"As for those who believe and work righteousness, indeed We will not cause to perish, the reward of any who does a righteous deed","18:31":"For them will be gardens of eternity, beneath them rivers will flow, they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and they will wear green garments of fine silk and heavy brocade. They will recline therein on raised thrones. How good the reward, how comfortable a destination","18:32":"Set forth for them the parable of two people, for one of them We provided two gardens of grapevines, and surrounded them with date palms, in between the two We placed cornfields","18:33":"Each of those gardens brought out its produce, and did not fail in the least. In the middle of them We caused a river to flow","18:34":"Abundant was the produce this man had. He said to his neighbor in the course of a discussion, “More wealth have I than you, and more honor, and powerful is my following.”","18:35":"He went into his garden in a state harmful to his soul. He said, “I think that this will never perish","18:36":"“Nor do I think that the Hour will ever come. Even if I am brought back to my Lord, I will surely find something better in exchange.”","18:37":"His neighbor said to him in the course of the discussion, “Do you deny Him Who created you out of dust, then out of a zygote, then fashioned you into a human being","18:38":"“I think for my part that He is God, my Lord, and none will I associate with my Lord","18:39":"“Why did you not, as you went into your garden say by God, ‘There is no power but with God,’ if you see me with less than you in wealth and children","18:40":"“It may be that my Lord will give me something better than your garden, and that He will send on your garden thunderbolts from the sky, making it as quick sand","18:41":"“Or the water of the garden will run off underground so that you will never be able to find it.”","18:42":"Then his fruits were ruined, and he went on grabbing and raking his hands through what he had spent on his property which had tumbled to pieces to its very foundations, and he could only say, “Oh my God, I wish I had never ascribed partners to my Lord.”","18:43":"Nor had he any to help him other than God, nor was he able to support himself","18:44":"There, the protection comes from God, the True One. He is the Best to reward, and the Best to give success","18:45":"Set forth to them the simile of the life of the present. It is like the rain which we send down from the skies. The earth’s vegetation absorbs it, but soon it becomes dry stubble which the winds scatter. It is God who prevails over all things","18:46":"Wealth and children are the adornments of the life of the present, but the things that endure are good deeds, and are best in the sight of your Lord as rewards, and best as hopes","18:47":"One day We will remove the mountains, and you will see the earth flattened, and We will gather them all together, and We will not leave out any one of them","18:48":"And they will be marshaled before your Lord in ranks, “Now you come to Us as We created you initially. Yes, you thought We would not fulfill the appointment made to you to meet Us.”","18:49":"And the book will be placed before you, and you will see the sinful full of fear because of what is in it. They will say, “Woe to us, what a book this is. It leaves out nothing small or large, and explains it.” They will find all that they did placed before them, and not one will your Lord treat with injustice","18:50":"Behold, We said to the angels, “Bow down to Adam,” They bowed down, except Lucifer. He was one of the jinn, and he ignored the command of his Lord. Will you then take him and his dupes as protectors rather than Me? They are enemies to you. Miserable will be the reward for the wrongdoers","18:51":"I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation, nor do I take helpers who lead the people astray","18:52":"One day He will say, “Call on those whom you thought to be My partners,” And they will call on them, but they will not listen to them, and We will make for them a place of common perdition","18:53":"And the sinful will see the fire and realize that they must fall therein. No way will they find to get away from it","18:54":"We have explained in detail in this Quran, for the benefit of humanity, every kind of example, but the human being is in most things contentious","18:55":"And what is there to keep back the people from believing, now that guidance has come to them, or from praying for forgiveness from their Lord, but they asked that the ways of those who came before be repeated, or the punishment be brought to them face to face","18:56":"We only send the messengers to give hope and to give warnings, but the unbelievers dispute with vain argument in order to weaken the truth, and they treat My signs without regard, although they are warned","18:57":"And who does more wrong than one who is reminded of the verses of his Lord, but turns away from them, forgetting that which his hands have sent forth? Indeed We have set veils over their hearts lest they should understand this, and over their ears is deafness, if you call them to guidance, even then will they never accept guidance","18:58":"But your Lord is most forgiving, full of mercy. If He was to call them to account for what they have earned, then surely He would have hastened their punishment, but they have their appointed time, beyond which they will find no refuge","18:59":"These were the populations we caused to perish when they committed injustices, but we fixed an appointed time for their destruction","18:60":"Behold, Moses said to his attendant, “I will not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas or until I spend years and years in travel.”","18:61":"But when they reached the junction, they forgot their fish which took its course through the sea as in a tunnel","18:62":"When they had moved on, Moses said to his companion, “Bring us our morning meal, truly we have suffered much fatigue at this stage of our journey.”","18:63":"He replied, “Do you remember when we climbed the rock? At that time I indeed forgot about the fish. None but Satan made me forget about it. It took its course through the sea in a mesmerizing way.”","18:64":"Moses said, “That was what we were seeking.” So they retraced their steps","18:65":"Then they found one of Our servants on whom We had bestowed mercy from Ourselves, and whom We had taught","18:66":"Moses said to him, “May I follow you, so that you may teach me something of the truth which you have been taught?”","18:67":"The other said, “Indeed you will not be able to have patience with me.”","18:68":"“And how can you have patience with things about which your understanding is not complete?”","18:69":"Moses said, “You will find me, if God so wills, patient, nor will I ignore your instructions.”","18:70":"The other said, “But if you follow me, ask me no questions about anything until I speak to you concerning it.”","18:71":"So the two proceeded, until they were on the boat, he scuttled it. Said Moses, “Have you scuttled it in order to drown those on it? Truly a strange thing have you done.”","18:72":"He answered, “Did I not tell you that you can have no patience with me?”","18:73":"Moses said, “Do not blame me for forgetting, nor be hard on me, thus making me feel worse.”","18:74":"Then they proceeded until they met a young man, he slew him. Moses said, “Have you slain an innocent soul who had killed no one? A truly disturbing thing have you done.” 74 (End of Part)","18:75":"He answered, “Did I not tell you that you can have no patience with me?”","18:76":"Moses said, “If ever I ask you about anything after this, do not keep me in your company, for you would have received enough excuses from me.”","18:77":"Then they proceeded, until they came to the inhabitants of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused them hospitality. They found there a wall at the point of falling down, so he set it up straight. Moses said, “If you had wished, surely you could have received some compensation for it.”","18:78":"He answered, “This is the parting between you and me. Now I will tell you the reasons for that which you were unable to have patience","18:79":"“As for the boat, it belonged to people in dire want. They plied on the water, so I wished to render it unserviceable, for there was after them a king who had every boat seized by force","18:80":"“As for the youth, his parents were people of faith, and we feared that he would grieve them by rebellion and ingratitude","18:81":"“So we desired that their Lord would give them in exchange, one better in refinement and closer in affection","18:82":"“As for the wall, it belonged to two youths, orphans in the town. There was beneath it a buried treasure to which they were entitled. Their father had been a righteous man, so your Lord desired that they should attain the age of maturity and retrieve their treasure, a mercy from your Lord. I did not do this of my own volition, but those are the reasons for that which you were unable to have patience.”","18:83":"They ask you concerning Dhul-Qarnayn say, “I will rehearse to you something of his story.”","18:84":"Indeed We established his power on earth, and We gave him the ways and means to all ends","18:85":"He went in one direction","18:86":"Until he reached the setting of the Sun, he found it set in a spring of murky water. Near it he found a people, and We said, “O Dhul-Qarnayn, either punish them or treat them with kindness.”","18:87":"He said, “Whoever does wrong, we will punish him, then will he be sent back to his Lord, and He will punish him with a punishment unheard-of","18:88":"“But whoever believes and works righteousness, he will have an excellent reward, and easy will be his task as We order it by our command.”","18:89":"Then he went in another direction","18:90":"Until he came to the rising of the Sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no covering protection against the Sun","18:91":"He left them as they were. We completely understood what was before him","18:92":"Then he went in another direction","18:93":"Until he reached a valley between two mountains, he found between them a people who hardly understood a word","18:94":"They said, “O Dhul-Qarnayn, the Gog and Magog do wrong on earth. Shall we then pay you in order that you might erect a barrier between them and us","18:95":"He said, “That which my Lord has given me is better. Just help me with strength. I will erect a strong barrier between you and them","18:96":"“Bring me blocks of iron.” Then, when he had filled up the space between the two steep mountainsides he said, “Blow!” Then, when he had made it as fire he said, “Bring me molten lead to pour over it.”","18:97":"From this they were made powerless to scale it, or to break through it","18:98":"He said, “This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will make it into dust, and the promise of my Lord is true.”","18:99":"On that day We will leave them to surge like waves on one another. The trumpet will be blown, and We will gather them all together","18:100":"And We will present hell that day for unbelievers to see","18:101":"Those whose eyes had been under a veil from remembrance of Me, and who even had been unable to hear","18:102":"Do the unbelievers think that they can take My servants as protectors besides Me? Indeed We have prepared hell for the unbelievers as a destination","18:103":"Say, “Shall we tell you of those who lose most in respect to their deeds","18:104":"“Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life, while they thought that they were acquiring good by their works?”","18:105":"They are those who deny the signs of their Lord, and the fact of their having to meet Him. Vain will be their works, nor will We on the Day of Accountability, give them any consideration","18:106":"Hell is their reward, because they rejected faith, and took My signs and My messengers, and ridiculed them","18:107":"As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, they have for their destination the gardens of paradise","18:108":"Wherein they will dwell forever. No changes will they want","18:109":"Say, “If the ocean were ink with which to write the words of my Lord, sooner would the ocean be exhausted than would the words of my Lord.” Even if We added another ocean like it to supplement it.”","18:110":"Say, “I am but a human being like yourselves. The inspiration has come to me that your God is one God. Whoever expects to meet his Lord let him work righteousness, and in the worship of his Lord, admit no one as partner","19:1":"Kaaf, Haa, Yaa, Ayn, Saud","19:2":"This is a recital of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zechariah","19:3":"Behold, he prayed to his Lord in private","19:4":"He said, “O my Lord, infirm indeed are my bones, and the hair on my head glistens with grey, but never am I unblessed, O my Lord, in my prayer to You","19:5":"“And I indeed fear what my people will do after me, but my wife is barren, so give me an heir as from You","19:6":"“One who will represent me, and represent the posterity of Jacob, and make him, O my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased.”","19:7":"“O Zechariah, We give you good news of a son. His name will be Yahya, to none by that name have We given before.”","19:8":"He said, “O my Lord, how will I have a son, when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age?”","19:9":"He said, “So it will be. Your Lord says, ‘that is easy for Me. I indeed created you before, when you were nothing.’ ”","19:10":"Zechariah said, “O my Lord, give me a sign.” “Your sign,” he answered, “Shall be that you will not speak to any person for three nights, even though you are not mute.”","19:11":"So Zechariah came out to his people from his chamber, and he conveyed to them, “Praise God in the morning and in the evening”","19:12":"“O Yahya, take hold of the Book with might.” And We gave him wisdom even as a youth","19:13":"As well as piety as from Us, and refinement. He was devout","19:14":"And kind to his parents, and he was not overbearing or rebellious","19:15":"So peace be upon him the day he was born, the day he dies, and the day that he will be raised up to life","19:16":"Relate in the Book, Mary. When she withdrew from her family to a place in the East","19:17":"She screened herself from them, then We sent her our angel, and he appeared before her as a human being","19:18":"She said, “I seek refuge from you with the Merciful Benefactor if you are a conscious being.”","19:19":"He said, “I am a messenger from your Guardian Evolver, sent to announce to you the gift of an innocent son","19:20":"She said, “How will I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?”","19:21":"He said, “Your Lord says, ‘that is easy for Me, and We wish to appoint him as a sign to humanity and a mercy from Us, it is a matter decreed.’ ”","19:22":"So she conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place","19:23":"And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She cried, “O, I wish that I had died before this, I wish that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight.”","19:24":"But a voice cried to her from beneath the palm tree, “Grieve not, for your Guardian Evolver has provided a rivulet beneath you","19:25":"“And shake towards yourself the trunk of the palm tree. It will make fresh, ripe dates fall upon you","19:26":"“So eat and drink, and cool your eye, and if you see any person say, ‘I have vowed a fast to God, the Merciful Benefactor, and this day I will not enter into any conversation with any human being’ ”","19:27":"Then she brought him to her people carrying him. They said, “O Mary, truly a curious thing have you brought.”","19:28":"“O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of wrong doing, nor your mother a woman unchaste.”","19:29":"But she pointed to the baby and they said, “How can we talk to one who is a baby in the cradle?”","19:30":"He said, “I am indeed a servant of God, He has given me revelation and made me a prophet","19:31":"“And He has made me blessed wherever I am, and has recommended to me prayer and the paying of zakat as long as I live","19:32":"“He has made me kind to my mother, and not overbearing or miserable","19:33":"“So peace be upon me the day I was born, the day that I die, and the day that I will be raised up to life again.”","19:34":"Such was Jesus the son of Mary. It is a statement of truth, about which they dispute","19:35":"It is not befitting to God that He should have a son. Glory be to Him. When He determines a matter, He only says to it “Be” and it is","19:36":"Indeed God is my Lord and your Lord. Therefore serve Him, this is a way that is straight","19:37":"But the sects differ among themselves, and woe to the unbelievers because of the judgment of a momentous day","19:38":"How plainly will they see and hear, the day that they will appear before Us, but the unjust, this day they are clearly in error","19:39":"But warn them of the day of distress, when the matter will be determined, for they are negligent and they do not believe","19:40":"It is We Who will inherit the earth, and all beings. To Us they will all be returned","19:41":"Abraham, he was a man of truth, a prophet","19:42":"Behold, he said to his father, “O my father, why worship that which hears not and sees not, and can profit you nothing","19:43":"“O my father, knowledge has come to me which has not reached you.

I will call on my Lord, perhaps because of my prayer to my Lord, I will not be unblessed.”","19:49":"Once he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides God, We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and each one of them We made a prophet","19:50":"And We bestowed Our mercy on them, and We granted them honor on the tongues of truth","19:51":"Also, mention in the Book, Moses, for he was specially chosen, and he was a messenger, a prophet","19:52":"And We called him from the right side of the Mountain, and made him draw near to Us to converse","19:53":"And out of Our mercy, We gave him his brother Aaron, a prophet","19:54":"Also mention in the Book, Ishmael. He was true to what he promised, and he was a messenger, a prophet","19:55":"He would recommend to his people prayer and zakat, and he was most acceptable in the sight of his Lord","19:56":"Also mention in the Book the story of Idris. He was a person of truth, a prophet","19:57":"And We raised him to a lofty station","19:58":"Those were some of the prophets on whom God bestowed His grace, from the posterity of Adam, and of those who We carried with Noah, and from the posterity of Abraham and Israel, from those whom We guided and chose.

This is a decree with your Lord which must be accomplished","19:72":"But We will save those who guarded against wrong, and We will leave the wrongdoers in there, on their knees","19:73":"When Our clear signs are rehearsed to them, the unbelievers say to those who believe, “Which of the two sides is in a better position? Which makes the best call?”","19:74":"And how many generations before them have we caused to perish, those who were even better off in possessions and appearance","19:75":"Say, “If any people go astray, God the Merciful Benefactor, allows it until they see the warning of God, either during punishment or on the Hour, they will finally realize who is worse in position, and weakest in force","19:76":"“And God advances in guidance, those who seek guidance, and the things that endure are good deeds, these are best in the sight of your Lord as a reward, and best for their return.”","19:77":"Have you then seen the person who rejects Our signs and says, “I will certainly be given wealth and sons?”","19:78":"Has he seen the unseen, or has he taken a contract with God, the Merciful Benefactor","19:79":"No, We will record what he says, and We will add repeatedly to his punishment","19:80":"To Us will return all that he speaks of, and he will appear before Us bare and alone","19:81":"And they have taken gods other than God, to give them power and glory","19:82":"Instead, they will reject their worship, and become enemies against them","19:83":"Do you not see that We have sicked Satan on the unbelievers to incite them with fury","19:84":"So do not rush them, for We count out for them a number","19:85":"The day We will gather the righteous to God, the Merciful Benefactor, as a dependent","19:86":"And We will drive those who are corrupt to hell, like thirsty livestock driven down to water","19:87":"None will have the power of intercession except those who received permission from God, the Merciful Benefactor","19:88":"They say, “God, the Merciful Benefactor, has a son.”","19:89":"Indeed you have put forward a thing most atrocious","19:90":"At this the skies are ready to burst, the earth to split asunder, and the mountains to fall down in utter ruin","19:91":"That they should invoke a son for God, the Merciful Benefactor","19:92":"For it is not consistent with the majesty of God, the Merciful Benefactor, that He should have a son","19:93":"Not one of the beings in the heavens and the earth come to God, the Merciful Benefactor, except as a servant","19:94":"He takes account of them all, and has numbered them all exactly","19:95":"And every one of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Accountability","19:96":"On those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, God the Merciful Benefactor, will bestow love","19:97":"We have made it easy in your own tongue, that with it you may give hope to the righteous, and warnings to people given to hostility","19:98":"But how many generations before them have We caused to perish? Can you find a single one of them, or hear so much as a whisper of them","20:1":"Taa, Haa","20:2":"We have not sent down the Quran to cause you distress","20:3":"But only as a reminder to those who fear","20:4":"A revelation from Him Who created the earth and the heavens on high","20:5":"God, the Merciful Benefactor, is firmly established on the throne","20:6":"To Him belongs what is in the heavens and on earth, and all between them, and all beneath the ground","20:7":"Whether you speak the word aloud or not, indeed He knows what is secret and what is even more hidden","20:8":"God, there is no god but He, to Him belong the most beautiful names","20:9":"Has the story of Moses reached you","20:10":"Behold, he saw a fire. So he said to his family, “Stay here, I perceive a fire, perhaps I can bring a torch from it, or find some guidance at the fire.”","20:11":"But when he came to the fire, a voice was heard, “O Moses","20:12":"“Indeed I am your Guardian Evolver, so remove your shoes. You are in the sacred valley Tuwa","20:13":"“I have chosen you. Listen then to the inspiration","20:14":"“Indeed I am God. There is no god but Me.

On it I lean, and with it I beat down fodder for my flocks, and in it I find other uses.”","20:19":"God said, “Throw it O Moses,”","20:20":"He threw it, and behold, it was a snake active in motion","20:21":"God said, “Seize it and fear not. We will return it at once to its previous state.”","20:22":"“Now draw your hand close to your side. It will come out white, without harm, as another sign","20:23":"“In order that We may reveal to you our greater signs","20:24":"“Go to Pharaoh, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds.”","20:25":"Moses said, “O my Lord, expand my breast","20:26":"“Ease my task for me","20:27":"“And remove the impediment from my speech","20:28":"“So that they may understand what I say","20:29":"“And give me a minister from my family","20:30":"“Aaron, my brother","20:31":"“Add to my strength through him","20:32":"“And have him share my task","20:33":"“That we may praise You much","20:34":"“And remember You much","20:35":"“For You are He Who is regardful of us.”","20:36":"God said, “Granted is your prayer, O Moses.”","20:37":"“And indeed We conferred a favor on you another time","20:38":"“Behold, We sent to your mother, by inspiration, this message","20:39":"“ ‘Place him into the basket, then place him into the river. The river will cast him up on the bank, and he will be taken up by one who is an enemy to Me and an enemy to him’.

Then you killed a man, but We saved you from trouble, and We tried you in various ways. Then you stayed a number of years with the people of Midian. Then you came near as ordained, O Moses","20:41":"“And I have prepared you for Myself.”","20:42":"“Go you and your brother with My signs, and slacken not, either of you, in keeping Me in remembrance","20:43":"“Go both of you to Pharaoh, for he has indeed transgressed all bounds","20:44":"“But speak to him gently. Perhaps he may take warning because of his admiration.”","20:45":"They said, “Our Lord, We fear that he will hasten with contempt against us, or that he will transgress all bounds.”","20:46":"He said, “Fear not, for I am with you, and I hear and see everything","20:47":"“So go both of you to him and say, ‘Indeed we are messengers sent by your Guardian Evolver.

Indeed with a sign we come from your Guardian Evolver, and peace to all who follow guidance","20:48":"“Indeed it has been revealed to us that the penalty awaits those who reject and turn away.”","20:49":"He said, “Who then, O Moses, is the Lord of you two?”","20:50":"He said, “Our Lord is He Who gave to each thing its form and nature, and further, gave it purpose.”","20:51":"He said, “What then happened to previous generations?”","20:52":"He replied, “The knowledge of that is with my Lord, duly recorded. My Lord never errs, nor forgets","20:53":"“He Who has made for you the earth, like a carpet spread out, has enabled you to go about therein by roads and channels, and has sent down water from the sky.” With it We have produced diverse pairs of plants, each distinct from the others","20:54":"Eat for yourselves, and pasture your livestock. Indeed in this are signs for people endued with understanding","20:55":"From the earth We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will bring you out once again","20:56":"And We showed Pharaoh all of Our signs, but he rejected them","20:57":"He said, “Have you come to drive us out of our land with your illusions, O Moses","20:58":"“But we can surely produce illusions to match yours. So set a meeting between us and you which we will not fail to keep, neither we nor you, in a place where both will have equal chances.”","20:59":"Moses said, “Your appointment is at the day of the festival, and let the people be assembled in the morning.”","20:60":"So Pharaoh left. He hatched his scheme, and then came back","20:61":"Moses said to him, woe to you. Do not tell a lie against God, lest He destroy you by chastisement. A forger must suffer penalty.”","20:62":"So they disputed, one with another, over their affair, but they kept their talks secret","20:63":"They said, “These two are certainly illusionists. Their object is to drive you out from your land with their illusions, and to do away with your most cherished institutions","20:64":"“Therefore concoct your plan, and then assemble in ranks. He wins today who gains the upper hand.”","20:65":"They said, “O Moses, would you rather that you throw first, or that we be the first to throw?”","20:66":"He said, “No please, throw first.” Then behold, their ropes and their staffs. And it seemed to him on account of their illusions that they began to move","20:67":"Then Moses sensed fear in himself","20:68":"We said, “Fear not, for you have indeed the upper hand","20:69":"“Present that which is in your right hand. Quickly it will swallow up that which they had faked. What they had faked is but an illusionist’s trick and the illusionist thrives not, no matter where he goes.”","20:70":"So the illusionists were humbled. They said, “We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.”","20:71":"He said, “Believe in Him before I give you permission? Surely this must be your leader, who has taught you illusions. Indeed I will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will have you crucified on trunks of palm trees. So you will know for certain which of us can give more severe and more lasting punishment.”","20:72":"They said, “Never will we consider you more than the clear signs that have come to us, or more than Him Who created us. So do whatever you want to do, for you can only influence in the life of the present","20:73":"“For us, we have believed in our Lord. May He forgive us our faults, and the illusions to which you compelled us to do, for God is Best and Ever Lasting.”","20:74":"Indeed he who returns to his Lord as a wrong-doer, for him is hell. Therein will he neither die nor live","20:75":"But those who come to Him as believers who have worked righteous deeds, for them are ranks exalted","20:76":"Gardens of eternity, beneath which rivers flow. They will dwell therein forever. Such is the reward of those who refine themselves","20:77":"We sent this inspiration to Moses, “Travel by night with My servants, and split a dry path for them through the sea, without fear of being overtaken and without any other fear.”","20:78":"Then Pharaoh pursued them with his forces, but the waters completely overwhelmed them and covered them up","20:79":"Pharaoh led his people astray instead of leading them aright","20:80":"O you Children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and We made a covenant with you on the right side of the mount, and We sent down to you manna and quail","20:81":"Saying, “Eat of the good things We have provided for your sustenance, but commit no excess therein, lest My punishment should justly descend on you, and those on whom My punishment descends, will indeed perish","20:82":"“But without doubt, I am He Who forgives again and again, those who repent, believe, and do right, they receive guidance.”","20:83":"“What made you hasten in advance of your people, O Moses?”","20:84":"He replied, “Behold, they are close on my footsteps. I hastened to you, O my Lord, to please you.”","20:85":"God said, “We have tested your people in your absence. Samiri has led them astray.”","20:86":"So Moses returned to his people frustrated and sorrowful. He said, “O my people, did your Lord not make an attractive promise to you? Did the promise seem to you too far off? Or did you desire that punishment should descend from your Lord on you, so you broke your promise to me?”","20:87":"They said, “We did not break the promise to you of our own volition, but we were made to carry the weight of the ornaments of the people, and we threw them, because that was what Samiri suggested","20:88":"“Then he brought out before them the image of a calf. It seemed mysterious, so they said, ‘this is your god, and the god of Moses, but he has forgotten.’ ”","20:89":"Could they not see that it could not return a word to them, and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good","20:90":"Aaron had already before this said to them, “O my people, you are being tested by this, for indeed your Lord is God, the Merciful Benefactor, so follow me and follow my advice.”","20:91":"They said, “We will not abandon this community, but we will devote ourselves to it until Moses returns to us.”","20:92":"Moses said, “O Aaron, what kept you back, when you saw them going wrong","20:93":"“From following me? Why did you not follow my advice?”","20:94":"Aaron replied, “O son of my mother, grab me not by my beard or by my hair. Truly I feared that you would say, ‘You have caused a division among the Children of Israel, and you did not respect my word.’ ”","20:95":"Moses said, “What then is your story, O Samiri?”","20:96":"He replied, “I saw what they saw not. So I grabbed a handful from the footprint of the messenger and threw it. This is what my soul suggested to me.”","20:97":"Moses said, “Go away, and your punishment in this life will be that you will say, ‘Untouchable’, and moreover you have a promise that will not fail. Now look at your god, of whom you have become a devoted worshipper. We will certainly melt it in a blazing fire and scatter it in the sea.”","20:98":"But the God of you all is the One God. There is no god but Him. Of all things He has knowledge","20:99":"Thus We relate to you stories of what happened before, for We have sent you a message from Us","20:100":"If any turn away from it, indeed they will bear a burden on the Day of Accountability","20:101":"They will remain in this state, and terrible will be the burden on them that day","20:102":"The day the trumpet will be sounded. That day, We will gather the sinful, blurry-eyed","20:103":"In whispers will they consult each other, “Yet they will stay no longer than ten","20:104":"We know best what they will say, when their leader best in conduct says, “You stayed not longer than a day.”","20:105":"They ask you concerning the mountains say, “My Lord will uproot them and scatter them as dust","20:106":"“He will leave them flat","20:107":"“Nothing crooked or curved will you see in their place.”","20:108":"On that day they will follow the caller. No crookedness concerning him either. All sounds will humble themselves in the presence of God, the Merciful Benefactor. Nothing will you hear but the sound of their feet","20:109":"On that day no intercession will help, except for those for whom permission has been granted by God, the Merciful Benefactor, and whose word is acceptable to Him","20:110":"He knows what is before, after, and behind them, but they will not understand it with their knowledge","20:111":"All faces will be humbled before Him, the Living, the Self-Sufficient, Eternal. Hopeless indeed will be the person that carries an injustice","20:112":"But he who does deeds of righteousness and has faith, will have no fear of harm or of being deprived of what he is due","20:113":"So We have sent this down, an Arabic Quran, and explained therein in detail some of the warnings, in order that they may be conscious of God, or that it may cause their remembrance","20:114":"High above all is God, the King, the Truth. Do not be impatient with the Quran before its communication to you is completed, but say, “O my Lord, advance me in knowledge.”","20:115":"We had already taken the covenant of Adam, but he forgot, and We found on his part no resolve","20:116":"When We said to the angels, “Prostrate to Adam,” they prostrated themselves, but not Lucifer, he refused","20:117":"Then We said, “O Adam, indeed this is an enemy to you and your mate. So do not let him get both of you out of the garden, so that you land in misery","20:118":"“There is enough there for you not to go hungry nor to go naked","20:119":"“Nor to suffer from thirst, nor from the Sun’s heat.”","20:120":"But Satan whispered wrong to him. He said, “O Adam, will I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that never decays?”","20:121":"So they both ate of the tree, and so their nakedness appeared to them. They began to sew together, for their clothes, leaves from the garden. Thus did Adam ignore his Lord, and allow himself to be seduced","20:122":"But his Lord, the Caller, chose him. He turned to him and gave him guidance","20:123":"He said, “Go down all together from the garden, with enmity between yourselves, but if, as is sure, there comes to you guidance from Me, whoever follows My guidance, will not lose his way, nor fall into misery","20:124":"“But whoever turns away from My message, indeed for him is a shallow life, and We will raise him up blind on the Day of Accountability.”","20:125":"He will say, “O my Lord, why have You raised me up blind when I had sight?”","20:126":"God will say, “Because when Our signs came to you, you disregarded them. So you will, this day, be disregarded.”","20:127":"This is how We reward him who transgresses beyond bounds and believes not in the signs of his Lord, and the penalty of the hereafter is far more terrible and more enduring","20:128":"Is it not a warning to these people, the many generations before them We caused to perish, in whose buildings they tour? Indeed, in this are signs for people endued with understanding","20:129":"Had it not been for a word that went forth before from your Lord, their punishment would have come, but there is a term appointed","20:130":"Therefore be patient with what they say, and praise your Lord, before the rising of the Sun, and before its setting. Yes, praise for part of the hours of the night, and at the sides of the day. That you may have joy","20:131":"Nor strain your eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to some of them. The splendor of the life of the present is how We challenge them. But the provision of your Lord is better and more enduring","20:132":"Encourage prayer for your people, and be consistent in it. We do not ask you to provide sustenance. We provide it for you, and the result is for the conscious","20:133":"They say, “Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord?” Has guidance not come to them from all that was in the previous books of scripture","20:134":"And if We had inflicted on them a penalty before this they would have said, “Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we would certainly have followed Your signs before we were humbled and put to shame.”","20:135":"Say, “Each one is waiting. So wait also, and soon will you know who is on the straight and even path, and who it is who has received guidance.” 135 (End of Part)","21:1":"Closer and closer to the human being comes their judgment. Yet they are heedless and they turn away","21:2":"There has never come to them a renewed message from their Lord that they did not listen to without regard","21:3":"While their hearts were distracted. The wrongdoers conceal their private meetings saying, “Is he more than a human like yourselves? Will you follow illusions with your eyes open?”","21:4":"Say, “My Lord knows each word in the heavens and on earth. He is the One Who hears and knows all things.”","21:5":"“No,” they say, \"A medley of dreams.\" \"No, he fabricated it\". \"No, he is a poet\". \"Let him bring us a sign like the ones that were sent to those in the past.”","21:6":"Before them, not one of the populations that We caused to perish believed. Will these believe","21:7":"Before you, those We sent were also only men to whom We granted inspiration. Ask those who have the message if you do not know","21:8":"Nor did We give them bodies that consumed no food, nor were they exempt from death","21:9":"In the end, We fulfilled Our promise to them, and We saved them and those whom We pleased, but We caused to perish those who transgressed beyond bounds","21:10":"We have revealed for you a book in which is a message for you. Will you not use your intelligence","21:11":"How many populations did We cause to perish because of their immorality and lack of ethics, establishing in their places other people","21:12":"Yet, when they sensed Our punishment behold, they tried to run from it","21:13":"Run not, but return to the good things of this life that were given to you, and return home, in order that you may be called to account","21:14":"They said, “Woe to us, we were indeed wrongdoers.”","21:15":"And that cry of theirs ceased not, until We made them as a mown field, or as ashes silenced","21:16":"We did not create the heavens and the earth for fun, nor all that is in between","21:17":"If it had been Our will to take a pastime, We could indeed have taken it from the things nearest to Us, if We would do such a thing","21:18":"No, We hurl the truth against falsehood, and it knocks out its brains, and behold, falsehood is bound to perish. Woe to you for the things you ascribe to Us","21:19":"To Him belong all that is in the heavens and on earth. Even those who are in His presence are not too proud to serve Him, nor do they tire in doing so","21:20":"They praise Him night and day, and they do not let up","21:21":"Have they taken for worship gods from the earth who can resurrect","21:22":"If there were in the heavens and the earth other gods besides God, there would have been confusion in both.

High is He above what they attribute to Him","21:23":"He cannot be questioned for His acts, but they will be questioned for theirs","21:24":"Have they taken for worship gods besides Him? Say, “Bring your proof. This is the message of those with me and the message of those before me.” But most of them do not know the truth, and therefore turn away","21:25":"No messenger did We send before you without this inspiration sent by Us to him, “There is no god but Me, therefore worship and serve Me.”","21:26":"And they say, “God, the Merciful Benefactor has a son, glory be to him.” No, they are servants raised to honor","21:27":"They do not speak before He speaks, and they act by His command","21:28":"He knows what is before them, and what is behind them, and none can intercede except for those whom He approves, and they stand in awe and reverence before Him","21:29":"If any of them should say, “I am a god besides Him,” We will reward them with hell. This is how We reward those who do wrong","21:30":"Do the unbelievers fail to see that the heavens and the earth were joined together, before We split them apart? We made every living thing from water. Will they not then believe","21:31":"And We have set on the earth mountains standing firm, lest it should shake with them, and We have made therein broad valleys between mountains for them to pass through, so that they may receive guidance","21:32":"And We have made the heavens as a canopy well guarded. Yet they turn away from the signs","21:33":"It is He Who created the night and the day, and the Sun and the Moon each float along in its orbit","21:34":"We did not grant to any person before you eternal life. If you must die, should they then live forever","21:35":"Every soul will have a taste of death, and We challenge you with bad and with good, and to Us you must return","21:36":"When the unbelievers see you, they treat you with ridicule, “Is this,” they say, “The one who talks of your gods?” But they reject even the mention of God, the Merciful Benefactor","21:37":"The human being is a creature of haste. Soon will I show you My signs, and then you will not ask Me to hasten them","21:38":"They say, “When will this promise come to pass if you are telling the truth?”","21:39":"If only the unbelievers knew of the time when they will not be able to ward off the fire from their faces, nor from their backs, nor will they be helped","21:40":"No, it may come to them all of a sudden and as a shock to them. Then no power will they have to avert it, nor will they have respite","21:41":"Mocked were messengers before you, but those who mocked were done in by the thing which they mocked","21:42":"Say, “Who can keep you safe by night and by day from God, the Merciful Benefactor?” Yet they turn away from the mention of their Guardian Evolver","21:43":"Or have they gods that can guard them from Us? They have no power to aid themselves, nor can they be defended from Us","21:44":"No, We gave the good things of this life to these people and their fathers, until the period grew long for them. Do they not see that We gradually reduce the land in their control from its outlying borders? Is it then they who will win","21:45":"Say, “I only warn you according to revelation.” But the deaf will not hear the call when they are warned","21:46":"If even a gust of the punishment of your Lord reaches them, they will then say, “Woe to us, we did wrong indeed.”","21:47":"We will set up scales of justice for the Day of Accountability, so no soul will be dealt with unjustly in the least. And if there be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it to account, and enough are We to take account","21:48":"In the past, We granted to Moses and Aaron the Criterion, and a light, and a message for those who are conscious","21:49":"Those who are conscious of their Guardian Evolver in their most private thoughts, and who hold the Hour in awe","21:50":"And this is a blessed message that We have sent down. Will you then reject it","21:51":"We gave Abraham moral authority and We knew him well","21:52":"Behold, he said to his father and his people, “What are these statues to which you are devoted?”","21:53":"They said, “We found our fathers worshipping them.”","21:54":"He said, “Indeed you have been in manifest error, you and your fathers.”","21:55":"They said, “Have you brought us the truth, or are you one of those who mock?”","21:56":"He said, “No, and your Lord is the Guardian Evolver of the heavens and the earth, and He is the One Who created them, and I am a witness to this","21:57":"“And by God, I have a plan for your idols after you go away and turn your backs.”","21:58":"Then he broke them to pieces, all but the biggest of them, so that they might turn to it","21:59":"They said, “Who has done this to our gods? He must indeed be of the wrong-doers.”","21:60":"They said, “We heard a youth talk of them. His name is Abraham.”","21:61":"They said, “Then bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may bear witness.”","21:62":"They said, “Are you the one who did this to our gods, O Abraham?”","21:63":"He said, “No, this was done by that, the biggest one. Ask them, if they can speak.”","21:64":"So they turned to themselves and said, “Indeed you are the ones in the wrong.”","21:65":"Then they were angered and embarrassed. They said, “You know full well that these do not speak.”","21:66":"Abraham said, “Do you then worship, besides God, things that can neither be of any good to you nor do you harm","21:67":"“Shame on you, and on the things that you worship besides God. Have you no sense?”","21:68":"They said, “Burn him and protect your gods, if you want to do something.”","21:69":"We said, “O fire, be cool and safe for Abraham.”","21:70":"Then they sought a plot against him, but We made them the ones who lost most","21:71":"And We delivered him and Lot to the land which We have blessed for the nations","21:72":"And We bestowed on him Isaac, and as an additional gift, Jacob, and We made righteous the people of each one of them","21:73":"And We made them leaders, guiding the people by Our command, and We sent them inspiration to do good deeds, to establish prayer, and to give zakat, and they constantly served Us","21:74":"And to Lot, We gave judgment and knowledge, and We saved him from the town which practiced abominations. Truly they were a people given to wrong, a rebellious people","21:75":"And We admitted him to Our mercy, for he was one of the righteous","21:76":"And Noah, when he cried, We listened to him, and delivered him and his family from great distress","21:77":"We helped him against the people who rejected Our signs. Truly they were a people given to wrong. So We drowned them all","21:78":"And remember David and Solomon, when they gave judgment in the matter of the field, into which the sheep of certain people had strayed by night. We did witness their judgment","21:79":"To Solomon We inspired the understanding of the matter.

He will speak to them because humanity did not believe with assurance in Our signs","27:83":"One day We will gather together from every people, a group of those who reject our signs, and they will be kept in ranks","27:84":"Until they come, and it will be said to them, “Did you reject My signs, though you comprehended them not, or what was it you did?”","27:85":"And the word will be fulfilled against them, because of their wrongdoing, and they will be unable to speak","27:86":"Do they not see that We have made the night for them to rest in, and the day to give them energy? Indeed in this are signs for any people who believe","27:87":"And the day that the trumpet will be sounded, terrified will be those who are in the sky, and those who are on earth, except who God wills to save, and all will come to His presence as beings conscious of their vulnerabilities","27:88":"You see the mountains and you think of them as immovable, but they will pass away as the clouds pass away. Such is the work of God, He Who manages all things, for He is well acquainted with all that you do","27:89":"Whoever comes with good, good will be waiting for him, and he will be secure from terror that day","27:90":"And if any does harm, their faces will be pushed down into the fire. Do you receive a reward other than that which you have earned by your deeds?”","27:91":"For me, I have been asked to serve the Guardian Evolver of this city, He Who has purified it, and to Whom belong all things, and I am asked to be of those who bow as Muslims","27:92":"And I recite the Quran. And if any accept guidance, they do it for the good of their own souls, and if any stray say, “I am only a warner.”","27:93":"And say, “Praise God, He Who will soon show you His signs, so that you will know them,” and your Lord is not unmindful of what you do","28:1":"Taa, Siin, Miim","28:2":"These are verses of the Book that makes things clear","28:3":"We rehearse to you some of the story of Moses and Pharaoh in truth for people who believe","28:4":"Truly Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and broke its people into sects, oppressing a small group among them. Their sons he killed, but he kept alive their females, and he has indeed committed crimes against humanity","28:5":"And We wished to be gracious to those who were being oppressed in the land, to make them leaders, and to make them heirs","28:6":"To establish them in the land, and to show Pharaoh, Haman, and the followers at their hands, the very things against which they were taking precautions","28:7":"So We sent this inspiration to the mother of Moses, “Suckle your child, but when you fear for him, cast him into the river, but fear not nor grieve, for We will return him to you, and We will make him one of Our messengers.”","28:8":"Then the people of Pharaoh took him out of the river. It was intended that Moses should be to them an adversary, and a cause of sorrow for Pharaoh, Haman, and all their followers were people who did harmful deeds","28:9":"The wife of Pharaoh said, “A comfort to the eye, for me and for you. Do not slay him, it may be that he will be useful to us, or we may take him as a son.” But they were unaware of what they were doing","28:10":"But then came a void in the heart of the mother of Moses. She would have disclosed his identity had We not strengthened her heart with faith, so that she would remain a believer","28:11":"And she said to the sister of Moses, “Follow him.” So the sister watched him in the guise of a stranger, so they would not know","28:12":"And We ordained that he would refuse to suckle at first, until his sister approached them and said, “Shall I point out to you a people of a house that will nourish and raise him for you, and who will be caring to him?”","28:13":"So We returned him to his mother, that her eye might be comforted, that she would not grieve, and that she would know that the promise of God is true, but most of them do not understand","28:14":"When he reached full age, and was firmly established, We bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge, this is how We reward those who do right","28:15":"And he entered the city at a time when its people were not watching, and he found there two people fighting, one from his sect, and the other from the sect of his enemy. Now the person of his sect appealed to him against his enemy, and Moses struck him with his fist and made an end to him. He said, “This is a work of the evil Satan, for he is an enemy that clearly misleads.”","28:16":"He prayed, “O my Lord, I have indeed wronged my soul. So forgive me, for my own sake.” So God forgave him, for He is the Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","28:17":"He said, “Lord, because You have bestowed Your grace on me, never will I be a help to those who do wrong.”","28:18":"In the morning he was in the city looking around in a state of fear when behold, the person who had the day before sought his help called aloud for his help again. Moses said to him, “Indeed you are clearly a combative person.”","28:19":"Then when he decided to strike the person who was an enemy to both of them, that person said, “O Moses, is it your intention to slay me as you slew a person yesterday? Your intention is nothing other than to become a powerful, violent person in the land, and not to be one who sets things right.”","28:20":"Then there came a person running from the farthest end of the city. He said, “O Moses, the leaders are meeting concerning whether or not to slay you, so leave, I give you sincere advice.”","28:21":"He then left from there, looking around in a state of fear. He prayed, “O my Lord, save me from the people given to wrongdoing.”","28:22":"Then when he turned his face towards the land of Madyan he said, “I hope that my Lord will show me the smooth path.”","28:23":"And when he arrived at the watering-place in Madyan, he found there a group of men watering their flocks, and besides them he found two ladies who were keeping back their flocks. He said, “What is the problem?” They said, “We cannot water our flocks until the shepherds move their flocks, for our father is a very old man.”","28:24":"So he watered their flocks for them, then he went back to the shade and said, \"O my Lord, indeed I am in desperate need of any good that You can send me.”","28:25":"Afterward, one of the damsels came back to him walking shyly. She said, “My father invites you that he may reward you for having watered our flocks for us.” So when he came to him and told the story he said, “Fear not, you escaped from people of wrongdoing.”","28:26":"Said one of them, “O my father, hire him, truly the best of people for you to employ is one of integrity.”","28:27":"He said, “I intend to wed one of my daughters to you on condition that you work for me for eight years, but if you complete ten years, it will be a favor from you, but I intend not to place you under any difficulty. Indeed you will find me, God willing, one of the righteous.”","28:28":"He said, “Let there be an agreement between you and me, that whichever of the two terms I fulfill let there be no resentment toward me, and God is a witness to what we say.”","28:29":"So when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was traveling with his family, he perceived a fire in the direction of Mount Tur. He said to his family, “Wait, I perceive a fire. I hope to bring you some knowledge from there, or a torch, that you may warm yourselves.”","28:30":"But when he came to the fire, a voice was heard from the right bank of the valley, from a tree in hallowed ground, “O Moses, indeed I am God, Lord of all the worlds","28:31":"“Now throw your staff.” But when he saw it moving of its own accord, as if it had been a snake, he turned back in retreat, and would not immediately return. “O Moses,” it was said, “Come close, and fear not, for you are of those who are secure","28:32":"“Put your hand in your chest and it will come out white without harm, and draw your hand close to your side to guard against fear. Those are two pieces of evidence from your Lord to Pharaoh and his advisors, for truly they are people rebellious and wicked.”","28:33":"He said, “O my Lord, I have slain a person among them, so I fear they will try to slay me","28:34":"“And my brother Aaron, he is more eloquent in speech than I, so send him with me as a helper, to edify and strengthen me, for I fear that they may accuse me of falsehood.”","28:35":"He said, “We will certainly strengthen your arm through your brother, and invest you both with authority, so they will not be able to touch you. With Our sign you will triumph, you two as well as those who follow you.”","28:36":"When Moses came to them with Our clear signs they said, “This is nothing but creative illusions. But never did we hear of this among our ancestors.”","28:37":"Moses said, “My Lord knows best who it is that comes with guidance from Him, and whose end will be best in the hereafter. Certainly the wrongdoers will not prosper.”","28:38":"Pharaoh said, “O advisers, no god do I know for you but myself. Therefore, O Haman, light me a kiln to bake bricks out of clay, and build me a lofty palace, that I may mount up to the God of Moses, but as far as I am concerned, I think Moses is a liar.”","28:39":"And he was arrogant and insolent in the land beyond reason, He and his army. They thought that they would not have to return to Us","28:40":"So We seized him and his army, and We flung them into the sea. Now you see what the end of those who did wrong was","28:41":"And we made them leaders inviting to the fire, and on the Day of Accountability no help will they find","28:42":"In the present We made a curse to follow them, and on the Day of Accountability they will be among the despised","28:43":"We revealed the Book to Moses, after We had caused the earlier generations to perish, in order to give to humanity insight, and also guidance and mercy, that they might receive advice","28:44":"You were not on the western side when We decreed the Commandments to Moses, nor were you a witness to those events","28:45":"But We raised up new generations, and extended life for them, and you were not a dweller among the people of Madyan, rehearsing Our signs to them, but it is We Who send messengers with inspiration","28:46":"Nor were you at the side of the Mountain of Tur when we called to Moses. But you are sent as a mercy from your Lord, to give warning to a people to whom no warner had come before you, in order that they may receive advice","28:47":"If We had not sent you to them, and a calamity had struck them for what their hands have sent forth they might say, “Our Lord, why did You not send us a messenger? We would have then followed Your signs and been among those who believe.”","28:48":"But when the truth has come to them from Us they say, “Why are signs not sent to him, like those which were sent to Moses?” Did they not reject the signs which were given to Moses? They say, “Two kinds of illusions, each assisting the other.” And they say, “As for us, we reject all such things.”","28:49":"Say, “Then bring a book from God which is a better guide than either of them, that I may follow it. Do it, if you are right.”","28:50":"But if they do not come to you, know that they only follow their desires, and who is more astray than one who follows his desires, devoid of guidance from God, for God does not guide people given to wrongdoing","28:51":"Now We have caused the word to reach them, in order that they may receive advice","28:52":"Those to whom We sent the Bible before this, they believe in it","28:53":"And when it is recited to them they say, “We believe in it, for it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed we were Muslims even before this","28:54":"Twice they will be given their reward, because they have persevered, because they deflect harm with good, and because they give out of what We have given them","28:55":"And when they hear vain talk, they turn away from it and say, “To us our deeds, and to you yours, peace be unto you. We do not seek ignorance.”","28:56":"It is true that you will not be able to guide every one you love, but God guides whom He wills and He knows best those who receive guidance","28:57":"They say, “If we were to follow the guidance with you, we would be snatched away from our land.” Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary to which are brought as tribute, fruits of all kinds, a provision from Ourselves? But most of them do not understand","28:58":"And how many populations have We caused to perish that exulted in their life of ease and plenty, now their dwellings after them are deserted, all but a few, and We are their heirs","28:59":"Nor was your Lord the One to destroy a population until He had sent to its center a messenger rehearsing to them Our signs, nor will We destroy a population, until its communities practice injustice","28:60":"The things that you are given are but the conveniences of this life and the glitter of it, but that which is with God is better and more enduring, will you not then be wise","28:61":"Are these two alike? One to whom We have made an excellent promise, and who will reach his fulfillment, and one to whom We have given the good things of this life, but who on the Day of Accountability is to be among those brought up for punishment","28:62":"That day God will call to them and say, “Where are My partners that you imagined as such?”","28:63":"Those against whom the charge will be proven will say, “Our Lord, these are the ones whom we led astray. We led them astray as we were astray ourselves. We free ourselves from them in Your presence. It was not us they worshipped.”","28:64":"It will be said to them, “Call upon your partners for help,” they will call upon them, but they will not listen to them, and they will see the penalty before them, they will wish, \"If only they had been open to guidance.”","28:65":"That day God will call to them and say, “What was the answer you gave to the messengers?”","28:66":"Then the whole story that day will seem obscure to them, like light to the blind, and they will not even be able to question each other","28:67":"But any who in this life had repented, believed, and worked righteousness, will have hopes to be among those who achieve salvation","28:68":"Your Lord creates and chooses as He pleases. No choice do they have. Glory be to God, and far is He above the partners they ascribe to Him","28:69":"And your Lord knows all that their hearts conceal and all that they reveal","28:70":"And He is God. There is no god but He. To Him is the praise, at the first and at the last, for Him is the command, and to Him will you all be brought back","28:71":"Say, do you see that if God were to make the night perpetual over you until the Day of Accountability, what god is there, other than God, that can give you light? Will you not then listen","28:72":"Say, do you see that if God were to make the day perpetual over you until the Day of Accountability, what god is there, other than God, that can give you a night in which you can rest? Will you not then see","28:73":"It is out of His mercy that He has made for you night and day, that you may rest therein, and that you may seek his grace, in order that you may be grateful","28:74":"The day that He will call on them, He will say, “Where are my partners whom you imagined to be such?”","28:75":"And from each people will We draw a witness, and We will say, “Produce your proof.” Then they will know that the truth is for God, and the lies which they invented, will leave them in the lurch","28:76":"Qarun was indeed of the people of Moses, but he acted insolently towards them. Such were the treasure We bestowed on him, and its keys would have been a burden even to a body of strong men. Behold, his people said to him, “Exult not, for God does not love those who exult in riches","28:77":"“But seek with the wealth which God has bestowed on you, the home of the hereafter, but do not forget your share in the present, but do good, as God has been good to you, and do not seek opportunities to do wrong in the land, for God does not love those who do wrong.”","28:78":"He said, “This has been given to me because of what I know.” Did he not know that God had caused to perish before him, entire generations which were superior to him in strength and greater in the riches they had accumulated? But the wrong-doers are not called immediately to account for their sins","28:79":"So he went to his people with the pride of his worldly glitter. Said those whose goal is the life of the present, “Oh I wish we had the like of what Qarun has, he is truly a master of good fortune.”","28:80":"But those who had been granted true knowledge said, “Unfortunately for you, the reward of God in the hereafter is best for those who believe and work righteousness, but none will attain this, except those who persevere in good.”","28:81":"Then We caused the earth to swallow him up, and his house, and he had not the least little group to help him against God, nor could he defend himself","28:82":"And those who had envied his position the day before began to say, “It is indeed God Who enlarges the provisions or restricts them for any of His servants He pleases. Had it not been that God was gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up. Indeed those who reject God will never prosper.”","28:83":"The home of the hereafter, We will give it to those who do not intend haughtiness or wrong on earth, and the end is best for the righteous","28:84":"If any does right, the reward for him is better than his deed, but if any does wrong, the doers of wrong are only punished to the extent of what they do","28:85":"Indeed He Who ordained the Quran for you, will bring you back to the place of return. Say, “My Lord knows best who it is who brings true guidance, and who is in manifest error.”","28:86":"And you were not expecting that the Book would be sent to you, except as a mercy from your Lord. Thus do not be a support to the rejecters","28:87":"And let nothing keep you back from the signs of God after they have been revealed to you, and invite the people to your Lord, and be not of the company of those who join gods with God","28:88":"And call not on another god, besides God. There is no god but He. Everything that exists will perish, except His Face. To Him belongs the command, and to Him will you all be brought back","29:1":"Alif, Laam, Miim","29:2":"Do the people think that they will be left alone by saying, “We believe,” and not be tested","29:3":"We tested those before them, and God will certainly make known those who are truthful from those who are liars","29:4":"Do those who do wrong think that they will get the better of Us? Poor is their judgment","29:5":"For those whose hopes are in the meeting with God in the hereafter, let them strive, for the term appointed by God is surely coming and He hears and knows all things","29:6":"And if any strive, they do so for their own souls, for God is free of all needs from all creation","29:7":"Those who believe and do righteous deeds, from them We will remove all sin that may be in them, and We will reward them according to the best of their deeds","29:8":"We have enjoined on humanity kindness to parents, but if either of them tries to force you to join in worship anything with Me of which you do not know, do not follow them. You all have to return to me, and I will tell you the truth of all that you did","29:9":"And those who believe and work righteous deeds, We will admit them to the company of the righteous","29:10":"Then there are some people who say, “We believe in God.” But when they suffer affliction in the cause of God, they perceive the human inflicted problem as if it were the punishment of God, and if help comes to you from your Lord, they are sure to say, “We were with you.” Does God not know best all that is in the heart of all creation","29:11":"And God most certainly knows those who believe, and just as certainly, those who are hypocrites","29:12":"And the unbelievers say to those who believe, “Follow our way, and we will bear the consequences of your faults.” Never in the least will they bear their consequences, in fact they are liars","29:13":"They will however, bear their own burdens, and share the burdens of others, and on the Day of Accountability they will be called to account for their lies","29:14":"Indeed We sent Noah to his people, and he stayed among them a thousand years less fifty, but the flood overwhelmed them while they persisted in harmful deeds","29:15":"But We saved him and the companions of the Ark, and We made the Ark a sign for all people","29:16":"And We also saved Abraham. Behold, he said to his people, “Serve God, and be conscious of Him. That will be best for you, if you understand","29:17":"“For you worship idols besides God, and you create falsehood. The things that you worship besides God has no power to give you sustenance. So seek sustenance from God, serve Him, and be grateful to Him. To Him will be your return","29:18":"“And if you reject the message, so did generations before you, and the duty of the messenger is only to preach publicly and clearly.”","29:19":"Do they not see how God originates creation then repeats it? Truly that is easy for God","29:20":"Say, “Travel through the earth and see how God originated creation, as will God produce a later creation, for God has power over all things","29:21":"“He punishes whom He pleases, and He grants mercy to whom He pleases, and toward Him are you turned","29:22":"“Neither on earth nor in heaven will you be able to flee from, or sabotage his plan, nor have you besides God, any protector or helper.”","29:23":"Those who reject the signs of God and the meeting with Him in the hereafter, and those who despair of My mercy, they will suffer a most terrible penalty","29:24":"So nothing was the answer of Abraham’s people except that they said, “Slay him, or burn him.” But God saved him from the fire. Indeed in this are signs for people who believe","29:25":"And he said, “You have taken for worship idols besides God, out of mutual love and regard between yourselves in this life, but on the Day of Accountability you will disown and curse each other, and your abode will be the ?re, and you will have none to help you.”","29:26":"But Lot had faith in Him. He said, “I will leave home for the sake of my Lord, for He is Exalted in Might, and Wise.”","29:27":"And We gave him Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and ordained among his progeny the prophetic office and revelation, and We granted him his reward in this life, and he was in the hereafter of the company of the righteous","29:28":"And Lot, when he said to his people, “You commit lewdness, such as no people in creation committed before you","29:29":"“Do you indeed approach men, and cut off the lineage? And practice sin, even in your councils?” But his people gave no answer except this, “Bring us the punishment of God if you tell the truth.”","29:30":"He said, “O my Lord, help me against the people who do wrong.”","29:31":"When Our messengers came to Abraham with the good news they said, “We are indeed going to destroy the people of this township, for truly they are addicted to sin.”","29:32":"He said, “But Lot is there.” They said, “We know full well who is there. We will certainly save him and his following, except his wife, she is of those who lag behind.”","29:33":"And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was grieved on their account, and felt powerless to protect them, but they said, “Fear not, nor grieve, we are here to save you and your following, except your wife, she is of those who lag behind","29:34":"“For we are going to bring down on the people of this township a punishment from heaven, because they have been totally rebellious.”","29:35":"And We have left of it an evident sign for any people who care to understand","29:36":"To the Madyan people We sent their brother Shu’aib, then he said, “O my people, serve God, and anticipate the Last Day, nor do wrong on the earth, as those do who are corrupt.”","29:37":"But they rejected him, then the mighty blast seized them, and they lay prostrate in their homes","29:38":"Remember also the ‘Ad and the Thamud people. Clearly there, their fate will appear to you from the traces of their buildings. Satan made their deeds alluring to them, and kept them back from the path, though they were gifted with intelligence and skill","29:39":"Remember also Qarun, Pharaoh, and Haman. There came to them Moses with clear signs, but they behaved with insolence on the earth, yet they could not overreach Us","29:40":"Each one of them We seized for their sin. Against some of them, We sent a violent tornado with showers of stones, some were caught by a mighty blast, some We caused the earth to swallow up, and some We drowned in the waters. It was not God Who wronged them, they wronged their own souls","29:41":"The parable of those who take protectors other than God, is that of the spider who builds for itself a house, but truly the flimsiest of houses is the spider’s house, if they only knew","29:42":"Indeed God knows of anything whatsoever they call upon besides Him, and He is Exalted in Power, the Wise","29:43":"And these are the parables We set forth for humanity, but only those with knowledge understand them","29:44":"God created the heavens and the earth in true proportions, indeed in that is a sign for those who believe. 44 (End of Part)","29:45":"Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to you, and establish prayer, for prayer restrains from shameful and harmful deeds, and remembering God is the greatest thing, and God knows the deeds that you do","29:46":"And do not dispute with the people of the Book, except with what is best, unless it is with those of them who inflict wrong. Instead say, “We believe in the revelation which has come down to us, and in that which came down to you. Our God and your God is one, and it is to Him we bow.”","29:47":"And We have sent down the Book to you. And those we gave the Book believe in it, as do some of these, and none but unbelievers reject our signs","29:48":"And you were not able to recite a book before this, nor are you able to transcribe it with your right hand. In that case indeed, they would have doubted","29:49":"No, here are signs self-evident in the hearts of those endowed with knowledge, and none but the unjust reject Our signs","29:50":"And they say, “Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, “The signs are indeed with God, and I am indeed a clear warner.”","29:51":"And is it not enough for them that we have sent down to you the Book that is rehearsed to them? Indeed, in it is a mercy and a reminder to those who believe","29:52":"Say, “Enough is God for a witness between you and me. He knows what is in the heavens and on earth, and it is those who believe in vanities and reject God who will perish","29:53":"They ask you to hasten the punishment for them. Had it not been for a term of respite appointed, the punishment would certainly have come to them, and it will certainly reach them all of a sudden, when they least expect it","29:54":"They ask you to hasten on the punishment, but indeed hell will encompass the rejecters of faith","29:55":"On the day that the punishment will cover them from above them and from below them, and a voice will say, “Taste the fruits of your deeds.”","29:56":"O My servants who believe, truly spacious is My earth, therefore serve Me","29:57":"Every soul will have a taste of death. In the end, to Us will you all be brought back","29:58":"But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, to them We will give a home in heaven, lofty mansions beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. An excellent reward for the workers","29:59":"Those who persevere in patience, and put their trust in their Lord","29:60":"How many are the creatures that do not carry their own sustenance? It is God who feeds them and you, for He hears and He knows","29:61":"If indeed you ask them who has created the heavens and the earth, and ordered the Sun and the Moon, they will certainly reply, “God.” How are they then deluded","29:62":"God increases the sustenance of whichever of His servants He pleases, and He saves for him, for God has full knowledge of all things","29:63":"And if indeed you ask them who it is that sends down rain from the sky, and gives life with it to the earth after its death, they will certainly reply, “God.” Say, “Praise belongs to God.” But most of them do not understand","29:64":"What is the life of the present but entertainment and play? But indeed the home in the hereafter, that is life indeed, if they only knew","29:65":"Now, if they embark on a vessel, they call on God, making their devotion sincerely and exclusively to Him, but once He has delivered them safely to land behold, they give a share of their worship to others","29:66":"Denying what We have given them, but let them enjoy it, because soon they will know","29:67":"Do they not then see that We have made a secure sanctuary, and that people are being snatched away from all around them? Then, do they believe in falsehood, and reject God","29:68":"And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against God or rejects the truth when it reaches him? Is there not a home in hell for those who do not believe","29:69":"And those who strive in Our cause, We will certainly guide them to our paths, for indeed God is with those who do right","30:1":"Alif, Laam, Miim","30:2":"The Roman Empire has been defeated","30:3":"In a land close by. But they, even after this defeat of theirs, will soon be victorious","30:4":"Within a few years. With God is the decision, in the past and in the future. On that day will the believers rejoice","30:5":"With the help of God. He helps whom He wills, and He is Exalted in Might, the Merciful Redeemer","30:6":"It is the promise of God. Never does God depart from His promise, but most people do not understand","30:7":"They know only the outer things in the life of the present, but of the end of things they are ignorant","30:8":"Do they not reflect in their own minds?

They were superior to them in strength. They tilled the soil and populated it in greater numbers than these have. There came to them their messengers with guidance which they rejected to their own peril.

To Him belong the loftiest descriptions in the heavens and the earth, for He is Exalted in Might, Full of Wisdom","30:28":"He gives to you a similitude from your own experience.

Then enjoy your brief day, but soon will you know your foolishness","30:35":"Or have We sent down authority to them that points out to them the things to which they pay part-worship","30:36":"When We give people a taste of mercy, they exult at it, and when some harm afflicts them because of what their own hands have sent forth behold, they are in despair","30:37":"Do they not see that God enlarges provision and restricts it for whomever He pleases?

Most of them worshipped others besides God.”","30:43":"But set your face to the upright way of life, before there comes from God the day that there is no chance of averting. On that day humanity will be divided in two","30:44":"Those who do not believe will suffer from that rejection, and those who work righteousness, they are preparing","30:45":"So that He may reward those who believe and work righteous deeds out of His bounty, but He does not love those who do not believe","30:46":"Among His signs is this, that He sends the winds as heralds of hope, giving you a taste of His grace and mercy, that the ships may sail majestically by His command, and that you may seek of His bounty, in order that you may be grateful","30:47":"We did indeed send before you, messengers to their respective peoples, and they came to them with clear signs.

Indeed the promise of God is true. So do not let this present life deceive you, nor let the chief deceiver delude you about God","31:34":"Indeed the knowledge of the Hour is with God. It is He Who sends down rain, and He Who knows what is in the wombs, and no one knows what it is that they will earn on the morrow, nor does anyone know in what land they are to die, indeed with God is full knowledge and He is acquainted with all things","32:1":"Alif, Laam, Miim","32:2":"This is the revelation of the Book in which there is no doubt, from the Guardian Evolver of all the systems of knowledge","32:3":"Or do they say, “He has fabricated it?” No, it is the truth from your Lord, so you can advise a people to whom no warner has come before you, in order that they may receive guidance","32:4":"It is God who has created the heavens and the earth, and all between them, in six days, and is firmly established on the throne of authority.

Every time they wish to get away from it, they will be forced deeper into it, and it will be said to them, “Taste the penalty of the fire that you used to deny.”","32:21":"And indeed We will make them taste of the penalty of this life, before the supreme penalty, in order that they may return","32:22":"And who does more wrong than one to whom is recited the signs of his Lord, and who then turns away from it? Indeed from those who transgress, We will exact due retribution","32:23":"We did indeed give the Book to Moses, so do not be in doubt of its reaching you, and We made it a guide to the Children of Israel","32:24":"And We appointed, from among them, leaders giving guidance under Our command, so long as they persevered with patience, and continued to have faith in Our signs","32:25":"Indeed your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Accountability, in the matters wherein they differ among themselves","32:26":"Does it not teach them a lesson, how many generations We caused to perish before them, in whose dwellings they walk in?

These are your sayings, but God tells you the truth, and He shows the right way","33:5":"Call them by the names of their fathers. That is more just in the sight of God, but if you do not know their father’s names, call them your brothers in faith, or your friends, but there is no blame on you if you make a mistake concerning this. What counts is the intention of your hearts, and God is Oft-Returning, Mercifully Redeeming","33:6":"The prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers.

They were shaken as by a tremendous shaking","33:12":"And behold, the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease say, “God and His messenger promised us nothing but delusion.”","33:13":"Behold, a group among them said, “You people of Yathrib, you cannot stand the attack, therefore go back.” And a group of them asks for leave of the Prophet saying, “Truly our houses are bare, and exposed,” though they were not exposed. They intended nothing but to run away","33:14":"And if an entry had been made for them from the sides of the city, and they had been incited to sedition, they would certainly have brought it to pass, with only a brief delay","33:15":"Even though they had already took a covenant with God not to turn their backs and a covenant with God must be answered for","33:16":"Say, “Running away will not profit you if you are running away from death or slaughter, and even if you do escape, no more than brief respite will you be allowed to enjoy.”","33:17":"Say, “Who is it that can screen you from God if it is His will to give you punishment or to give you mercy?” Nor will they find for themselves, besides God, any protector nor helper","33:18":"Indeed God knows those among you who keep the people back, and those who say to their brothers, “Come along with us,” but they do not come to the fight, except for a few","33:19":"Who rely on you. And when danger arises, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving, like one of those who death hovers over, but when the danger has passed, they will strike you with sharp tongues, covetous of the good. Such people have no faith, so God has made their deeds of no effect, and that is easy for God","33:20":"They think that the confederates have not withdrawn, and if the confederates should come again, they would wish they were in the deserts wandering among the Bedouins, and seeking news about you from a safe distance, and if they were in your presence, they would fight only a little while","33:21":"You indeed have in the messenger of God, an excellent example of conduct, for anyone whose hope is in God and the Last Day, and who engages much in the praise of God","33:22":"When the believers saw the confederate army they said, “This is what God and his messenger promised us, and God and His messenger told us the truth.” And it only added to their faith and their zeal for obedience","33:23":"Among the believers are people who have been true to their covenant with God.

No advantage did they gain, and enough is God for the believers in their fight, and God is full of strength, able to enforce His will","33:26":"And the people of the Book who aided them, God took them down from their strongholds and cast fear into their hearts. So that some you slew, and some you made prisoners","33:27":"And He made you heirs of their lands, their houses, their goods, and of a land which you had not visited before, and God has power over all things","33:28":"O prophet, say to your wives, “If you want the life of the present and its glitter, then come, I will provide for your enjoyment and will let you go in a handsome manner","33:29":"But if you want God and His messenger, and the home of the hereafter, indeed God has prepared for the good doers among you, a great reward","33:30":"O wives of the Prophet, if any of you were proven guilty of unseemly conduct, the punishment would be doubled for her, and that is easy for God. 30 (End of Part)","33:31":"But any of you who are devout in the service of God and His messenger, and works righteousness, twice will We grant a reward to her, and We have prepared for her generous sustenance","33:32":"O wives of the Prophet, you are not like any of the other women. If you realize it, do not speak intuitively, lest one in whose heart is sickness should be moved with expectations, but speak as you should","33:33":"And dwell in your homes without flaunting yourselves like those of the days of ignorance, and establish prayer, and give zakat, and follow God and His messenger. God wishes only to remove all character flaws from you, and the members of your family, in order to refine you","33:34":"And recite what is rehearsed to you in your homes from the signs of God and His wisdom, for God is Subtle and Aware","33:35":"For Muslim men and women, for believing men and women, for devout men and women, for true men and women, for men and women who are patient, for men and women who humble themselves, for men and women who give in charity, for men and women who fast, for men and women who guard their chastity, and for men and women who engage much in God's praise, for them God has prepared forgiveness and a great reward","33:36":"It is not fitting for a believer, man or woman, when a matter has been decided by God and His messenger to differ concerning that decision. If anyone ignores God and His messenger, he is certainly and clearly on a wrong path","33:37":"Behold, you said to one who had received the grace of God and your favor, \"Hold on to your wife, and be conscious of God.” But you hid in your heart that which God was about to make manifest.

But give them a gift, and then let them go","33:50":"O Prophet, We have made permissible to you, your wives to whom you have given their dowry, and those whom your right hand possess, out of those who God has assigned to you, and daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts, and daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts who migrated with you, and any believing woman who dedicates herself to the Prophet, if the Prophet wishes to wed her.

But when you are invited, feel free to enter, but once you have finished your meal, leave without making conversation. Such behavior annoys the Prophet. He is shy about asking you to leave, but God is not shy about telling you the truth, and when you ask them for something, ask them from behind a screen. That makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs, nor is it right for you to annoy God's messenger, nor should you marry his widows after him at any time. Truly such a thing is in God's sight an enormity","33:54":"Whether you reveal anything or conceal it, indeed God has full knowledge of all things","33:55":"There is no blame on these women if they appear before their parents or their sons, their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sisters’ sons, or their maids, or those whom their right hands possess, but be conscious of God, for God is witness to all things","33:56":"God and His angels send blessings on the Prophet. O you who believe, send blessings on him, and salute him with greetings","33:57":"Indeed those who defy God and defy His messenger, God has cursed them in the present and in the future, and has prepared for them a crushing punishment","33:58":"And those who distress believing men and women undeservedly bear on themselves a glaring sin","33:59":"O prophet, tell your wives and daughters, and the believing women, that they should draw their outer wear over themselves. That is more modest, that they may be acknowledged but not harassed, and God is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming","33:60":"Truly if the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who stir up sedition in the city do not desist, We will certainly stir you up against them. Then they will not be able to stay there as your neighbors for any length of time","33:61":"They will have a curse on them, and whenever they are found, they will be seized and slain without mercy","33:62":"Such was the Sunnah of God among those who lived.

Then which of the signs of God will you deny","40:82":"Do they not travel through the earth and see what the end of those before them was? They were more numerous, and superior in strength, and in the traces they have left in the land. Yet all that they accomplished was of no profit to them","40:83":"For when their messengers came to them with clear signs, they reveled in the knowledge and skill they had. But the very thing, at which they were accustomed to ridicule, captured them","40:84":"But when they saw Our punishment they said, “We believe in God, the one God, and we reject the partners we joined with Him.”","40:85":"But their professing the faith when they saw Our punishment was not going to profit them.

But indeed, those who have inherited the Book after them, are in suspicious doubt concerning it","42:15":"Now then, for that reason, call them and stand steadfast as you are asked to, and do not follow their vain desires but say, “I believe in the Book that God has sent down, and I am asked to judge justly between you. God is our Lord and your Lord, for us is the responsibility for our deeds, and for you, your deeds. There is no contention between you and us. God will bring us together, and to Him is Our final goal","42:16":"But those who dispute concerning God, after He has been accepted, futile is their dispute in the sight of their Lord. On them will be a terrible penalty","42:17":"It is God Who has sent down the Book in truth, and the balance, but what will make you realize that the Hour is nearby","42:18":"Only those wish to hasten it who do not believe in it. Those who believe, hold it in awe, and know that it is the truth. Behold, those who dispute concerning the Hour are far astray","42:19":"Gracious is God to His servants. He gives sustenance to whom He pleases, He has power, and can carry out His will","42:20":"To any who desire the fields of the hereafter, We give increase in his fields, and to any who desires the fields of the present, We grant them some of it, but he has no share in the hereafter","42:21":"What, have they partners who have established for them some way without the permission of God? Had it not been for the decree of judgment, the matter would have been decided between them. But indeed the wrongdoers will have a terrible penalty","42:22":"You will see the wrongdoers in fear because of what they have earned, and the burden of that must fall on them, but those who believe and work righteous deeds, will be in the luxurious meads of the gardens. They will have before their Lord all that they wish for. That will indeed be a magnificent bounty","42:23":"That is the bounty by which God gives hope to His servants who believe and do righteous deeds. Say, “No reward do I ask of you for this, except the love of close family.” And if anyone earns any good, We will give him an increase of good in respect of it, for God is Oft-Forgiving, most ready to appreciate service","42:24":"What, do they say, “He has fabricated a lie against God?” But if God willed, He could seal up your heart, and God blots out vanity, and proves the truth by His words, for He knows well the secrets of all hearts","42:25":"He is the One Who accepts repentance from His servants and forgives sins, and He knows all that you do","42:26":"And He listens to those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, and gives them increase from His bounty, but for the unbelievers, theirs is a terrible penalty","42:27":"If God were to enlarge provisions for His servants, they would indeed transgress beyond all bounds through the earth, but he sends it down in due measure as He pleases, for He is with His servants, and is Well-Acquainted, and Watchful","42:28":"He is the One Who sends down rain after people have given up hope, and scatters His mercy, and He is the Protector, Worthy of All Praise","42:29":"And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the living creatures that He has scattered through them, and He has power to gather them together when He wills","42:30":"Whatever misfortune happens to you is because of the things your hands have done, and for many of them He grants forgiveness","42:31":"Nor can you stop His will in the earth, nor do you have besides God, anyone to protect or to help","42:32":"And among His signs are the ships running smoothly through the ocean as mountains","42:33":"If it were His will, He could stop the wind. Then they would become motionless on the face of the ocean. Indeed in this are signs for all who patiently persevere and are grateful","42:34":"Or He can cause them to perish because of the harm that they have earned, but much does He forgive","42:35":"But let those know who dispute about Our signs, that there is for them no way of escape","42:36":"Whatever you are given here is only a temporary enjoyment of this life, but that which is with God is better and longer lasting. It is for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord","42:37":"Those who avoid great sins and shameful deeds, and when they are angry, even then they forgive","42:38":"Those who listen to their Lord, and establish prayer, who conducts their affairs by consultation, who gives out of what We bestow on them for sustenance","42:39":"And those who when oppression is inflicted on them, defend themselves","42:40":"The reward for an injury is an injury equal to it, but if a person forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from God, for God does not love those who do wrong","42:41":"But indeed, if any help and defend themselves after a wrong is done to them, on them there is no cause for blame","42:42":"The blame is only against those who oppress people, do wrong, and transgress beyond bounds through the land, defying right. For them there will be a terrible penalty","42:43":"But indeed if any show patience and forgiveness, that would truly be a courageous resolution to their affairs","42:44":"For any whom God leaves astray, there is no protector after that, and you will see the wrongdoers when in sight of the penalty say, “Is there any way to return?”","42:45":"And you will see them brought forward to the penalty, in a humble frame of mind, because of their disgrace, and looking with a stealthy glance, and the believers will say, “Those are indeed in loss, who has given to perdition their own souls, and those belonging to them on the Day of Accountability. Behold, truly the wrongdoers are in a lasting penalty.”","42:46":"And they have no protectors to help them, other than God, and for any whom God leaves to stray, there is no way to guide them","42:47":"Listen to your Lord, before there comes a day which there will be no averting it from God. That day there will be for you no place of refuge, nor will there be for you any room for denial","42:48":"If then they run away, We have not sent you as a guardian over them. Your duty is only to convey the message, and truly, when We give people a taste of mercy from Ourselves, they rejoice in it, but when some harm comes to them on account of the deeds which their hands have sent forth, then indeed people are ungrateful","42:49":"To God belongs the control of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He delivers male or female according to His will","42:50":"Or He delivers both males and females, and He leaves unable to have children, whom He wills, for He is full of knowledge and power","42:51":"It is not possible for human beings that God should speak to them except by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by the sending of a messenger to reveal, with God's permission, what God wills, for He is Most High, Most Wise","42:52":"And so We have, by Our permission, sent inspiration to you. Before, you did not know what revelation was, or what faith was, but We have made it a light with which We guide such of Our servants as We will, and indeed you guide people to the straight way","42:53":"The way of God, to Whom belongs what is in the heavens and what is on earth. Behold, all affairs reach God","43:1":"Haa, Miim","43:2":"By the Book that makes things clear","43:3":"We have made it a Quran in Arabic that you may be able to understand","43:4":"And indeed, it is in the mother of the Book, in Our presence, high and full of wisdom","43:5":"Shall We then take away the message from you and disregard you, because you are a people transgressing beyond bounds","43:6":"But how many were the messengers We sent among peoples throughout history","43:7":"And there never came a messenger to them that they did not mock","43:8":"So We caused them to perish. They were stronger than these in power are. And it is passed on, the parable of past peoples","43:9":"If you were to ask them, “Who created the heavens and the earth?” They would be sure to reply, “They were created by Him, the Exalted in Power, Full of Knowledge.”","43:10":"The same One Who has made for you the earth spread out, and has made for you roads and channels in it, in order that you may be guided","43:11":"He Who sends down rain from the sky in due measure, and We raise to life with it a land that is dead, as will you be raised","43:12":"He Who has created everything in pairs, and has made for you ships and livestock on which you ride","43:13":"In order that you may sit firmly on them, and glorify the favor of your Lord and say, “Praise to Him Who has subjected these to our use, for we could never have done this","43:14":"“And to our Lord, indeed we must return.”","43:15":"Yet they attribute to some of His servants, a share with Him. Indeed human beings are clearly ungrateful","43:16":"What, has He taken daughters out of what He Himself creates, and given sons to you","43:17":"When news is brought to one of them of the birth of what he attributes to God, the Merciful Benefactor, his face darkens, and he is filled with inward grief","43:18":"One who is to be reared to be a trophy, and finds themselves torn by inner conflict","43:19":"And they created into females, angels who themselves serve God. Did they witness their creation? Their evidence will be recorded, and they will be called to account","43:20":"They say, “If it had been the will of God, the Merciful Benefactor, we would not have worshipped such deities.” They have no knowledge of that, they do nothing but lie","43:21":"What, have We given them a book before this, to which they hold fast","43:22":"No, they say, “We found our fathers following a certain way, and we guide ourselves by their footsteps.”","43:23":"In the same way that when We sent a warner before you to any people, the elite among them said, “We found our fathers following a certain way, and we will certainly follow in their footsteps.”","43:24":"He said, “What, even if I brought you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following?” They said, “For us, we deny that you are sent on a mission at all.”","43:25":"So We took retribution from them. Now see what the end of those who rejected it was","43:26":"Behold, Abraham said to his father and his people, “I indeed clear myself of what you worship","43:27":"“I worship only Him Who made me, and He will certainly guide me.”","43:28":"And he left it as a word to endure among those who came after him, that they might return","43:29":"Yes, I have given the good things of this life to these people and their parents, until the truth has come to them, and a messenger making things clear","43:30":"But when the truth came to them they said, “This is deception, and we reject it.”","43:31":"They also say, “Why is this Quran not sent down to some great person in either of the two cities?”","43:32":"Do they distribute the mercy of your Lord? It is We Who distribute among them their livelihood in the life of the present, and We raise some of them above others in ranks, so that some may benefit from the work of others, but the mercy of your Lord is better than that which they amass","43:33":"And were it not that all people might become one community, We would provide for everyone who rejects the Merciful Benefactor, silver roofs for their houses and silver stairways on which to climb","43:34":"And silver doors to their houses, and thrones of silver on which they could recline","43:35":"And adornments of gold. But all this is nothing but conveniences of the present life. The hereafter, in the sight of your Lord, is for the righteous","43:36":"If anyone turns himself from remembrance of God, the Merciful Benefactor, We appoint for him a devil to be a close friend to him","43:37":"They hinder them from the path, but they think that they are being guided aright","43:38":"Then, when such a one comes to Us, he says to his friend, “I wish that between you and me were the distance of East and West.” How terrible this friend is","43:39":"When you have done wrong, it will not benefit you that day, you will be partners in punishment","43:40":"Can you then make the deaf to hear, or give direction to the blind, or to those who wander in manifest error","43:41":"Even if We take you away, We will be sure to exact retribution from them","43:42":"Or We will show you that which We have promised them, for indeed We will prevail over them","43:43":"So hold fast to the revelation sent down to you, indeed you are on a straight way","43:44":"The Quran is indeed the message for you and for your people, and soon will you be brought to account","43:45":"And question those to whom we sent our messengers before you, did We appoint any deities other than God, the Merciful Benefactor, to be worshipped","43:46":"We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his advisors. He said, “I am a messenger of the Lord of all worlds.”","43:47":"But when he came to them with Our signs, behold, they ridiculed them","43:48":"We showed them sign after sign, each greater than the other, and We seized them with punishment, in order that they might turn to Us","43:49":"And they said, “O sorcerer, invoke your Lord for us according to His covenant with you, for we will truly accept guidance.”","43:50":"But when We removed the penalty from them behold, they broke their word","43:51":"And Pharaoh proclaimed among his people saying, “O my people, does not the control of Egypt belong to me? See these streams flowing underneath me? What, do you not see","43:52":"“Am I not better than this one who is seemingly insignificant and can hardly express himself clearly","43:53":"“Then why are not gold bracelets bestowed on him, or why do there not come with him angels accompanying him?”","43:54":"So he made fools of his people, and they followed him. Truly were they a rebellious people","43:55":"So when they provoked Us, We took retribution from them, and We drowned them all","43:56":"And We made them a people of history and an example in the hereafter","43:57":"When the son of Mary is held up as an example behold, your people protested aloud about it","43:58":"And they said, “Are our gods best, or is he?” This was presented to you only for argument. Yes, they are a contentious people","43:59":"He was no more than a slave. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example to the Children of Israel","43:60":"And if it were Our will, We could make angels from among you, succeeding each other on the earth","43:61":"And this will be a sign of the Hour. Therefore have no doubt about it, but follow Me. This is a straight way","43:62":"Do not let Satan hinder you, for he is to you a sworn enemy","43:63":"When Jesus came with clear signs he said, “Now I come to you with wisdom, and to make clear to you some of that which you dispute. Therefore be aware of God and follow me","43:64":"“For God, He is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight way.”","43:65":"But sects from among them fell into disagreement. Then woe to the wrongdoers, for the penalty of a terrible day","43:66":"Do they only wait for the Hour, that it should come on them all of a sudden while they perceive it not","43:67":"Friends on that day will be foes, one to another, except for the righteous","43:68":"My devotees. No fear will be on you that day, nor will you grieve","43:69":"Those who believed in Our signs and were submissive","43:70":"Enter the garden, all of you and your spouses, rejoicing","43:71":"To them will be passed around, gold plates and goblets of gold. There will be all that the souls could desire, all that their eyes could enjoy, and you will live therein forever","43:72":"Such will be the garden of which you are made heirs because of your deeds","43:73":"You will have therein abundance of fruit, from which you will have satisfaction","43:74":"The wrong-doers will be in the punishment of hell, to dwell therein","43:75":"The punishment will not be lightened for them, and they will be there in despair, overwhelmed","43:76":"In no way will We be unjust to them, but they have been unjust to themselves","43:77":"They will cry, “O Malik, have your Lord put an end to us.” He will say, “No, you must remain.”","43:78":"Indeed We have brought the truth to you, but most of you have hatred for truth","43:79":"What, have they settled some plan among themselves? But it is We Who settle things","43:80":"Or do they think that We do not hear their secrets and their private counsels? Indeed We do, and Our messengers are by them to record","43:81":"Say, “If God, the Merciful Benefactor had a son, I would be the first to worship him.”","43:82":"Glory to the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the throne. He is free from the things they attribute to Him","43:83":"So leave them to converse vainly and play, until they meet that day of theirs which they have been promised","43:84":"It is He Who is God in heaven and God on earth, and He is full of wisdom and knowledge","43:85":"And blessed is He to Whom belongs the control of the heavens and the earth, and all between them. With Him is the knowledge of the Hour, and to Him will you be brought back","43:86":"And those whom they invoke besides God have no power of intercession. Only he who bears witness to the truth, and know","43:87":"If you ask them who created them, they will certainly say God. How then are they deluded away from the truth","43:88":"God has knowledge of the messenger’s cry, “O my Lord, truly these are people who will not believe.”","43:89":"But turn away from them, and say “Peace.” But soon they will know","44:1":"Haa, Miim","44:2":"By the Book that makes things clear","44:3":"We sent it down during a blessed night, for We wish to warn","44:4":"In the night is made clear every affair of wisdom","44:5":"By command, from Our presence, for We send revelation","44:6":"As mercy from your Lord, for He hears and knows all things","44:7":"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all between them, if you have an assured faith","44:8":"There is no god but He. It is He Who gives life and gives death, the Guardian Evolver to you and your earliest ancestors","44:9":"Yet they play around in doubt","44:10":"Then watch for the day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke, plainly visible","44:11":"Smothering the people. This will be a terrible penalty","44:12":"“Our Lord, remove the penalty from us, for we really do believe.”","44:13":"How can there be a reminder for them, seeing that a messenger explaining things clearly has already come to them","44:14":"Yet they turn away from him and say, “Tutored by others, a person possessed.”","44:15":"We will indeed remove the penalty for a while and truly you will return","44:16":"One day We will seize you with a mighty onslaught. We will indeed exact retribution","44:17":"We did, before them, try the people of Pharaoh. There came to them a messenger honorable","44:18":"Saying, “Restore to me the servants of God.

We caused them to perish because they were guilty of harmful deeds","44:38":"We did not create the heavens, the earth, and all between them, for mere play","44:39":"We did not create them except for just ends, but most of them do not understand","44:40":"Indeed the day of sorting out is the time appointed for all of them","44:41":"The day no protector can avail his client in anything, and no help can they receive","44:42":"Except those who receive God's mercy, for He is Exalted in Might, the Merciful Redeemer","44:43":"Indeed the tree of Zaqqum—","44:44":"Will be the food of the sinful","44:45":"Like molten brass, it will boil in their insides","44:46":"Like the boiling of scalding water","44:47":"“Seize him and drag him into the middle of the blazing fire","44:48":"“Then pour over his head the penalty of boiling water","44:49":"“Taste this. Truly were you mighty, full of pride","44:50":"“Indeed this is what you used to doubt.”","44:51":"As for the righteous, they will be in a position of security","44:52":"Among gardens and springs","44:53":"Dressed in fine silk and in rich brocade, they will face each other","44:54":"And We will join them to companions with beautiful eyes","44:55":"There they can call for every kind of fruit in peace and security","44:56":"Nor will they taste death there, only the first death, and He will preserve them from the penalty of the blazing fire","44:57":"As a bounty from your Lord. That will be the ultimate achievement","44:58":"Indeed, We have made this easy in your tongue, in order that they may take heed","44:59":"So wait and watch, for they too are waiting","45:1":"Haa, Miim","45:2":"The revelation of the Book is from God, the Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom","45:3":"Indeed in the heavens and the earth are signs for those who believe","45:4":"And in the creation of yourselves, and the fact that animals are scattered through the earth, are signs for those of assured faith","45:5":"And in the alternation of night and day, and the fact that God sends down sustenance from the sky, and revives the earth with it after its death. And in the change of the winds, are signs for those who are wise","45:6":"Such are the signs of God which We rehearse to you in truth, and then in what hadith will they believe in after rejecting God and His signs","45:7":"Woe to each harmful liar","45:8":"He hears the signs of God rehearsed to him, yet is obstinate and arrogant, as if he had not heard them. Then announce to him a terrible penalty","45:9":"And when he learns something of Our signs, he takes them without regard, for them there will be a crushing penalty","45:10":"In front of them is hell, and of no profit to them is anything that they may have earned, nor is any protectors they may have taken for themselves besides God, for them is a tremendous penalty","45:11":"This is guidance. And for those who reject the signs of their Lord, is a punishingly, painful penalty","45:12":"It is God Who has subjected the sea to you, that ships may sail through it by His command, that you may seek of his bounty, and that you may be grateful","45:13":"And He has subjected to you, from Himself, all that is in the heavens and on earth. Behold, indeed in that are signs for those who reflect","45:14":"Tell those who believe, to forgive those who do not look forward to the days of God. It is for Him to reward each people according to what they have earned","45:15":"If anyone does a righteous deed, it is surely to the benefit of their soul. If they does wrong, it works against their soul. In the end, you will all be brought back to your Lord","45:16":"We granted to the Children of Israel the Book, and the Wisdom, and the prophetic office. We gave them for sustenance, things good and pure, and We favored them above the nations","45:17":"And We granted them clear signs in all affairs. It was only after knowledge had been granted to them that they fell into disagreements through insolent envy among themselves. Indeed your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Accountability, as to those matters in which they had differences","45:18":"Then We put you in the best way of life. So follow that way, and do not follow the desires of those who know not","45:19":"They will be of no use to you in the sight of God, it is only wrongdoers who stand as protectors, one to another, but God is the Protector of the righteous","45:20":"This is clear evidences to humanity, and a guidance and mercy to those of assured faith","45:21":"What, do those who seek corrupt ways think that We will hold them equal with those who believe and do righteous deeds, equal will be their life and their death? Wrong is their judgment","45:22":"God created the heavens and the earth for just ends, and in order that each soul may find the reward of what it has earned, and none of them will be wronged","45:23":"Then do you see the one who takes as his god his own vain desire? God has, knowing him as such, left him astray, and sealed his hearing and his heart, and put a veil on his sight. Who then will guide him after God? Will you not then receive advice","45:24":"And they say, “What is there other than our life in the present? We will die and we live, and nothing but time can destroy us.” But of that, they do not know. They only theorize","45:25":"And when Our clear signs are rehearsed to them, their argument is nothing but this, they say, “Bring back our ancestors, if what you say is true.”","45:26":"Say, “It is God Who gives you life, then gives you death, then He will gather you together for the Day of Accountability, about which there is no doubt.” But most people do not understand","45:27":"To God belongs the control of the heavens and the earth, and the day that the Hour of Judgment is established, that day will the liars perish","45:28":"And you will see every community bowing on knee. Every community will be called to its record, “This day will you be rewarded for all that you did","45:29":"“This, Our record, speaks about you with truth, for We put on record all that you did.”","45:30":"Then, as to those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them to His mercy, and that will be the achievement for all to see","45:31":"But as for those who rejected God, to them it will be said, “Were not Our signs rehearsed to you? But you were arrogant, and were a people given to harmful deeds","45:32":"“And when it was said that the promise of God was true, and that as for the Hour, there was no doubt about its coming, you used to say, ‘We do not know what the Hour is. We only think it is a theory, and we have no firm assurance.’ ”","45:33":"Then will appear to them the harmfulness of what they did, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock","45:34":"It will also be said, “This day We will ignore you as you ignored the meeting of this day of yours, and your abode is the fire, and you have no helpers","45:35":"“This is because you used to take the signs of God without regard, and the life of the world deceived you.” Therefore, on that day, they will not be taken out, nor will they be taken into grace","45:36":"Then praise God, Lord of the heavens, and Lord of the earth, Lord of all the worlds","45:37":"To Him is glory throughout the heavens and the earth, and He is Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom. 37 (End of Part)","46:1":"Haa, Miim","46:2":"The revelation of the Book is from God, the Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom","46:3":"We did not create the heavens and the earth, and all between them, except for just ends, and for a term appointed.

Enough is He for a witness between you and me, and He is Oft-Forgiving, Mercifully Redeeming.”","46:9":"Say, “I do not depart from the messengers, nor do I know what will be done with me or with you. I follow only that which is revealed to me by inspiration. I am only a warner open and clear.”","46:10":"Say, “Look, if this is from God, and you reject it, and a witness from among the Children of Israel testifies to it as an example of scripture, and has believed while you are arrogant, then know that God does not guide people who are unjust.”","46:11":"The unbelievers say about those who believe, “If this message were a good thing, such people would not have gone to it first before us.” And seeing that they do not guide themselves by it they will say, “This is a fake.”","46:12":"And before this, the Book of Moses was a guide and a mercy, and this Book confirms it in the Arabic tongue, to advise the unjust, and as hope to those who do right","46:13":"Indeed those who say, “Our Lord is God,” and remain firm, on them will be no fear, nor shall they grieve","46:14":"These will be companions of the gardens, dwelling therein forever, a reward for their deeds","46:15":"We have enjoined on the human being kindness to his parents. In pain did his mother carry him, and in pain did she give birth to him. Carrying the child and his weaning is a period of thirty months. Then, when he reaches the age of full strength and attains forty years he says, “My Lord, bless me to be grateful for Your favors that You have bestowed upon me, and upon both my parents, and to do the righteous deeds that You approve of, and be gracious to me for my harmful deeds.

Still We bestowed on those among them who believed, their reward, but many of them are rebellious transgressors","57:28":"O you who believe, be conscious of God, and believe in His messenger, and He will bestow on you a double portion of His mercy.

This is because they are people void of understanding","59:14":"They will not even fight you together, except in a fortified town, or from behind walls. Strong is their fighting among themselves. You would think they were united, but their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people devoid of wisdom","59:15":"Like those of late. They have tasted the harmful result of their conduct, and for them is a terrible penalty","59:16":"Like Satan, when he says to the human being, “Deny God.” But once he denies God he says, “I disassociate myself from you.

horizon","81:24":"He neither grudgingly withholds knowledge of the unknown","81:25":"Nor is it the word of Satan","81:26":"So where are you going","81:27":"Indeed it is no less than a message to all the worlds","81:28":"For whomever among you wills to go straight","81:29":"But you will not will, except as God wills, the Lord of all the worlds","82:1":"When the universe is ripped apart","82:2":"When the stars are scattered","82:3":"When the oceans are made to gush forth","82:4":"And when the graves are turned upside down","82:5":"Then each soul will know what it has sent forward and what it has kept back","82:6":"O human being, what has seduced you from your Guardian Evolver, the Most Honorable","82:7":"He Who created you, fashioned you and balanced you","82:8":"In

think that they will be called to account","83:5":"On a mighty day","83:6":"A day when all of humanity will stand before the Lord of all the worlds","83:7":"No, surely the record of the corrupt is in sijjin","83:8":"And what will explain to you what sijjin is","83:9":"It is a register inscribed","83:10":"Woe that day, to those who deny it","83:11":"Those who deny the Day of Accountability","83:12":"And none deny it but every transgressor beyond bounds, those who are corrupt","83:13":"When Our signs are rehearsed to him, he says, “Tales of the ancients.”","83:14":"By no means, but on their hearts is the stain of that which they do","83:15":"Indeed, from their Lord that day, they will be veiled","83:16":"Further, they will enter the fire of hell","83:17":"Further, it will be said to them, “This is that which you rejected as false","83:18":"No, indeed the record of the righteous is in illiyin","83:19":"And what will explain to you what illiyin is","83:20":"It is a register inscribed","83:21":"To which those nearest bear witness","83:22":"Truly the righteous will be in bliss","83:23":"From on thrones, they observe","83:24":"You will recognize in their faces the beaming brightness of bliss","83:25":"Their thirst will be quenched with natural juice, sealed","83:26":"The seal of it will be musk, and for this let those aspire who have aspirations","83:27":"With it will be a mixture of tasnim","83:28":"A spring, from which those nearest to God will drink","83:29":"Those in sin used to laugh at those who believed","83:30":"And whenever they passed by them, they used to wink at each other","83:31":"And when they returned to their people, they would return joking","83:32":"And whenever they saw them, they would say, “Behold, these are indeed people astray.”","83:33":"But they had not been sent as keepers over them","83:34":"But on this day, the believers will laugh at the unbelievers","83:35":"On thrones they will observe","83:36":"Will the unbelievers not have been paid back for what they did","84:1":"When the universe is ripped apart","84:2":"And it listens to its Guardian Evolver, as it must","84:3":"And when the earth is flattened out","84:4":"And casts up what is within it and becomes empty","84:5":"And listens to its Lord, as it must","84:6":"O human beings, indeed you are toiling on towards your Lord, ever toiling, but you will meet Him","84:7":"Then he who is given his record in his right hand","84:8":"Soon his account will be taken by an easy reckoning","84:9":"And he will turn to his people rejoicing","84:10":"But he

day","85:3":"By one who witnesses, and the subject of the witness","85:4":"Woe to the makers of the pit","85:5":"The fire supplied with fuel","85:6":"Behold, they sat over against the fire","85:7":"And they witnessed all that they were doing against the believers","85:8":"And they treated them wrongfully for no other reason than that they believed in God, the All Mighty, the Praiseworthy","85:9":"Him to Whom belongs the control of the heavens and the earth, and God is witness to all things","85:10":"Those who persecute or draw into temptation the believers, men and women,

Give respite to them for a while","87:1":"Glory to the name of your Lord Most High","87:2":"Who has created, and further gives order and proportion","87:3":"Who has ordained laws, and granted guidance","87:4":"And Who makes the pasture grow","87:5":"And then makes it dark stubble","87:6":"By degrees We will teach you to declare the message, so you will not forget","87:7":"Except what God wills, for He knows what is manifest and what is hidden","87:8":"And We will ease you to what is easy","87:9":"Therefore give advice, in case the advice profits","87:10":"The advice will be received by those who are conscious of God","87:11":"But it will be avoided by the most unfortunate ones","87:12":"Who will enter the great fire","87:13":"In which they will then neither die nor live","87:14":"But those will flourish who refine themselves","87:15":"And glorify the name of their Lord in prayer","87:16":"No, you prefer the life of the present","87:17":"But the hereafter is better and longer lasting","87:18":"And this is in the Ancient Books","87:19":"The Books of Abraham and Moses","88:1":"Has the story reached you of the overwhelming event","88:2":"Some faces that day will be humiliated","88:3":"Laboring hard","88:4":"While they are entering the blazing fire","88:5":"While they are given drink, from a boiling hot spring","88:6":"No food will there be for them but a bitter Dhari’","88:7":"That will neither nourish nor satisfy hunger","88:8":"Faces that day will be joyful","88:9":"Pleased with their striving","88:10":"In a garden on high","88:11":"Where they will hear no vanity","88:12":"There will be a bubbling spring","88:13":"There will be thrones raised on high","88:14":"Goblets placed","88:15":"And cushions set in rows","88:16":"And rich carpets spread out","88:17":"Do they not look at the camels, how they are made","88:18":"And at the sky, how it is raised high","88:19":"And at the mountains, how they are firmly fixed","88:20":"And at the earth, how it is spread out","88:21":"Therefore give advice, for you are one to advise","88:22":"You are not one to manage their affairs","88:23":"But if any turn away and reject God","88:24":"God will punish him with a mighty punishment","88:25":"To Us will be their return","88:26":"Then it will be for Us to call them to account","89:1":"By the dawn","89:2":"By the ten nights","89:3":"By the even

these transgressed beyond bounds in the lands","89:12":"And spread corruption therein","89:13":"Therefore your Lord poured on them a scourge of diverse chastisements","89:14":"For your Lord is on a watchtower","89:15":"Now, as for humanity, when their Lord tries them, giving them honor and gifts, they then say, “My Lord has honored me.”","89:16":"But when He tries them, restricting subsistence from them, he says then, “My Lord has humiliated me.”","89:17":"But no, you do not honor the orphans","89:18":"Nor do you encourage one another to feed the poor","89:19":"And you devour inheritance, all with greed","89:20":"And you love wealth with inordinate love","89:21":"No, when the earth is pounded to powder","89:22":"And your Lord comes, and His angels, rank upon rank","89:23":"And hell, that day, is brought forth, on that day will the human being remember, but how will that remembrance profit him","89:24":"He will say, “I wish that I had invested in my life.”","89:25":"For that day, their chastisement will be such as none else can inflict","89:26":"And His bonds will be such as none other can bind","89:27":"To the righteous soul it will be said, “O you soul in complete rest and

city","90:2":"And you are free in this city","90:3":"As are the parent and child","90:4":"Indeed We have created the human being into toil and struggle","90:5":"Do they think that none has power over them","90:6":"They may say, “Wealth have I accumulated in abundance","90:7":"Does he think that no one sees him","90:8":"Have We not made for him a pair of eyes","90:9":"And a tongue, and a pair of lips","90:10":"And shown him the two highways","90:11":"But he has made no rush to the path that is steep","90:12":"And what will explain to you the path that is steep","90:13":"It is freeing the captive","90:14":"Or giving food in a day of hunger","90:15":"To the orphan who claims relationship","90:16":"Or to the indigent down in the dust","90:17":"Then will he be of those who believe, and
