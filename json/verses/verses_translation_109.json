And they (these two angels charged with teaching people some occult sciences such as breaking a spell and protection against sorcery) never taught them to anyone without first warning, \"We are a trial, so do not disbelieve (– It is risky to learn the knowledge given to us, therefore use it in lawful ways, and beware of committing an act of unbelief by abusing it.)\" And (yet) they (those who followed the falsehoods of the satans) learned from them (the two angels) that by which they might divide a man and his wife. But (though they wrongly attributed creative power to sorcery, in fact) they could not harm anyone thereby save by the leave of God. And they learned what would harm them, not what would profit them. Assuredly, they knew well that he who bought it (in exchange for God’s Book) will have no share (no happy portion) in the Hereafter. How evil was that for which they sold their selves; and if only they had known (acted like people of true knowledge and understanding)","2:103":"And if only they had believed and, in fear and reverence of God, sought to deserve His protection (against their straying and His punishment), a reward from God (of which they could not conceive) would have been absolutely good; if only they had known (acted like people of true knowledge and understanding)","2:104":"O you who believe!

For them is disgrace in the world, and in the Hereafter a tremendous punishment","2:115":"(They attempt to exploit the issue of qiblah – the direction of Prayer – as a pretext to bar Muslims from places of worship and to prevent God’s Name being mentioned and invoked in them.)

Now, you surely do admit Abraham’s Prophethood, so) remember that his Lord tested Abraham with commands and ordeals (such as his being thrown into a fire, the destruction of the people of his kinsman Lot, and his being ordered to sacrifice his son Ishmael), and he fulfilled them thoroughly. He said: \"Indeed I will make you an imam for all people.\" He (Abraham) pleaded: \"(Will You appoint imams) also from my offspring?\" He (his Lord) answered: \"(I will appoint from among those who merit it.

To whomever an instruction comes from his Lord, and he desists (from interest), he may keep his past gains (legally), and his affair is committed to God (– if he repents sincerely and never again reverts to taking interest, he may hope that God will forgive him).

Let the witnesses not refuse when they are summoned (to give evidence). And (you, O scribes) be not loath to write down (the contract) whether it be small or great, with the term of the contract. Your doing so (O you who believe), is more equitable in the sight of God, more upright for testimony, and more likely that you will not be in doubt. If it be a matter of buying and selling concluded on the spot, then there will be no blame on you if you do not write it down; but do take witnesses when you settle commercial transactions with one another, and let no harm be done to either scribe or witness (nor let either of them act in a way to injure the parties). If you act (in a way to harm either party or the scribe and witnesses) indeed it will be transgression on your part. (Always) act in due reverence for God and try to attain piety.

God knows well all about your faith (and measures you by it); and (whether you be free or slaves) you are one from another (belonging, as believers, to the same faith and community). Marry them, then, with the leave of their guardians, and give them their bridal-due according to religiously lawful and customary good practice, they being women who give themselves in honest chastity, not in licentiousness, nor having secret love-companions. Then if they commit indecency after they have entered into wedlock, they shall be liable to half the penalty to which free (unmarried) women are liable. That (permission to marry slave-girls) is for those of you who fear to fall into sin (by remaining unmarried).

By doing so, those who disbelieve are (further) misled, declaring it (the month they postpone) permitted in one year and forbidden in another, in order that they may conform to the number of the months that God has declared as sacred, (without caring) that they thereby make lawful what God has made unlawful.

God is surely with us.\" Then God sent down His gift of inner peace and reassurance on him, supported him with hosts you cannot see, and brought the word (the cause) of the unbelievers utterly low.

I ask of you no wealth for it (for conveying the Message to you); my wage is due only from God. I will not drive away those who believe; they are destined to meet their Lord (Who will treat them as they should be treated) – whereas I see you as a people acting in ignorance","11:30":"O my people! Who could help me against God were I to drive them away? Will you not then reflect and be mindful","11:31":"And I do not say to you that with me are the treasures of God, nor do I know the Unseen (what is stored in the future), nor do I say that I am an angel, nor do I say of those, whom your eyes hold in contempt, that God will not grant them some good. God knows best whatever is in their bosoms (what kind of people they are in their inner worlds). (If I drove them away or spoke ill of them), then I would indeed be among the wrongdoers","11:32":"They said: \"O Noah! You have argued with us, and have prolonged your arguments; so stop arguing with us and, if you are telling the truth, bring upon us what you have been threatening us with","11:33":"Noah said: \"Only God can bring it upon you, if He wills; and you can never be frustrators (of His will)","11:34":"My counsel – much as I would counsel you – will not benefit you, if God has willed that you be and remain misguided. He is your Lord (Who created you, and nurtures, sustains and protects you), and you are on the way to return to Him","11:35":"Do they (the idolaters) say (of you, O Messenger): \"He has fabricated it (invented all those stories and the Qur’an containing them)?\" Say: \"If indeed I fabricate it, then upon me falls my sin, but (as you are slandering me to excuse your own willful persistence in unbelief, know that) I am free of the sins you have been committing","11:36":"And it was revealed to Noah (by Us): \"Never will any of your people believe except those who have already believed. Then, do not be distressed because of what they have been doing","11:37":"Build the Ark (which We have described to you) under Our eyes and in accordance with Our instructions to be revealed (to you), and do not plead with Me for those who have persisted in wrongdoing. They are bound to be drowned","11:38":"And so Noah set to building the Ark. And every time the leading ones among his people passed by him, they mocked at him. He said: \"Now you are mocking us, but (a day will come when) we mock you just as you mock us","11:39":"And so shall you know upon whom will come a punishment which will disgrace him, and upon whom will alight a lasting punishment (in the Hereafter)","11:40":"(And so it went on) until the time when Our command came and the boiler started boiling over. We said (to Noah): \"Embark in it a pair of each kind (of living creature), and your family, except those against whom Our sentence has already been passed, and those who believe.\" And those who believed with him were few","11:41":"Noah said, \"Board it!\" (and all the people and the pairs of creatures God willed should be saved were settled in the Ark). \"In God’s Name be its course and its mooring. Surely my Lord is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate","11:42":"So the Ark floated with them amid waves like mountains, and Noah cried out to a son of his who was standing apart: \"Embark with us, my son, and do not be with the unbelievers","11:43":"He said: \"I will betake myself to a mountain that will protect me from the waters!\" He (Noah) said: \"Today there is no protection from God’s judgment except for him on whom He has mercy.\" And the waves came between them, and he (the son) was among the drowned","11:44":"And it was said: \"O earth, swallow up your waters! And, O sky, cease (your rain)!\" And the waters were made to subside, and (by God’s will) the affair was accomplished. Then the Ark came to rest on al-Judi, and it was said: \"Away with the wrongdoing people","11:45":"Noah called out to his Lord, saying: \"O my Lord, my son was of my family (as a believer), and Your promise is surely true (for my believing family members), and You are the Most Just of judges","11:46":"(God) said: \"O Noah! he (being an unbeliever) is not of your family. He is one of unrighteous conduct (which embodied his unbelief). So do not ask of Me what you have no knowledge of. I admonish you so that you do not behave as one among the ignorant","11:47":"(Noah) said: \"O my Lord! I seek refuge in You, lest I should ask of You what I have no knowledge of. And unless You forgive me and have mercy on me, I will indeed be among the losers","11:48":"He was told: \"O Noah! Get you down in peace and safety from Us, and with blessings upon you and upon the communities (of believers) who are with you (and those to descend from you and them).

Neither you nor your people knew them before this. Then (seeing that there is no substantial difference between the conditions in which the Messengers carried out their missions and the reactions they encountered) be patient (with their reactions and their persistence in unbelief). The (final, happy) outcome is in favor of the God-revering, pious","11:50":"And to (the people of) ‘Ad We sent their brother Hud. He said: \"O my people! Worship God alone: you have no deity other than Him. You are only fabricators of falsehood (in attributing partners to Him)","11:51":"O my people! I ask of you no wage for it (for conveying the Message to you); my wage is due from only Him Who originated me with a particular character. Will you not use your reason","11:52":"O my people! Implore your Lord to forgive you (for the sins you have so far committed) and turn to Him repentant that He may cause the sky to pour down upon you abundant rain, and add strength to your strength. So, do not turn your backs (on this message that I convey to you), as disbelieving criminals","11:53":"O Hud!\" they said: \"You have brought us no clear sign (– a miracle to prove your Messengership). We are not going to forsake our deities on your mere saying so, the more so as we do not believe you","11:54":"We say only that some of our deities have possessed you with evil.\" Hud said: \"Surely I call God to witness, and you too be witnesses, that I am free of what you associate (with God as partners with Him)","11:55":"Apart from Him (I only take Him as Deity and Lord). So, scheme against me all together, and then give me no respite","11:56":"I have put my trust in God, my Lord and your Lord. No living creature is there but He holds it by its forelock and keeps it under His complete control.

My Lord will (if you continue in your rejection) cause another people to take your place, whereas you cannot harm Him in the least. Surely, my Lord keeps watch and record of all things","11:58":"And when Our judgment came to pass (because the people of ‘Ad did continue in their rejection), We saved Hud and those who believed with him out of a mercy from Us (because of their faith, righteousness and patience): We saved them from a harsh punishment","11:59":"Such were the ‘Ad. They obstinately rejected the Revelations of their Lord (the signs and miracles proving His Oneness and all other essentials of faith) and they rebelled against His Messengers (by rejecting the Messenger – Hud – sent to them), and followed every stubborn tyrant","11:60":"And a curse was made to pursue them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection. Beware! The ‘Ad disbelieved in their Lord with ingratitude; so away with the ‘Ad, the people of Hud","11:61":"And to (the people of) Thamud (We sent) their brother Salih (as Messenger to convey the same message): \"O my people! Worship God alone: you have no deity other than Him. He has raised you from the earth and settled you in it, enabling your dignity and prosperity. So, ask forgiveness of Him (for the sins you have so far committed) and turn to Him repentant.

Would you now seek to prevent us from worshipping what our forefathers used to worship? Indeed we are in real doubt concerning what you call us to","11:63":"He said: \"O my people! What do you think – if I stand on a clear evidence from my Lord, and He has granted me a mercy from Himself – who could help me against God were I to disobey Him? You would add to me nothing but ruin","11:64":"O my people! This is the she-camel from God as a sign for you (of the kind you demand to see before you believe). So leave her alone to pasture on God’s earth, and touch her with no evil lest an imminent punishment should seize you","11:65":"But (unable to bear to see her as an evidence of the truth of Salih’s message) they cruelly slaughtered her. Then he (Salih) said: \"Enjoy the life in your habitations three days more, (then will be your ruin). This is a threat that will not be proved false","11:66":"So when Our judgment came to pass, We saved Salih and those who believed with him out of mercy from Us (because of their faith, righteousness, and patience), from the ignominy of that day.

Beware! The Thamud disbelieved in their Lord (and were ungrateful for His favors), so away with the Thamud","11:69":"And Our (heavenly) envoys came (in human form) to Abraham with glad tidings. They said \"Peace!\", and he (returning the greeting) said \"Peace!\" Without delay, he brought them a roasted calf","11:70":"But when he saw that their hands did not reach out to it, he was doubtful of them (deeming their conduct strange) and became apprehensive of them. They said: \"Do not fear! We have been sent to the people of Lot","11:71":"Meanwhile his (old, infertile) wife, standing by, felt she was menstruating (and smiled); and We gave her the glad tidings of (the birth of) Isaac and, after Isaac, of (his son) Jacob","11:72":"She said: \"Oh, woe is me! Shall I bear a child, now that I am an old woman, and this my husband is an old man? That would be a strange thing indeed","11:73":"They (the envoys) said: \"Are you surprised at God’s command?

Cease from this! For sure, the command of your Lord has already gone forth; and there is coming upon them a punishment not to be turned back","11:77":"And when Our envoys came to Lot, he was troubled on their account and felt himself powerless to protect them, and he said: \"This is a distressful day","11:78":"His people came rushing to him, driven by their perverted desire, as they had before that been committing such abominations. Lot said: \"O my people! Here are my daughters; they are utterly clean for you (to satisfy your desires in wedlock). Have fear of God, and do not disgrace me in respect of my guests.

Wait and watch, then, and I am watching with you","11:94":"And so when Our judgment came to pass, We saved Shu‘ayb and those who believed in his company out of a mercy from Us (because of their faith, righteousness and patience), and the awful blast seized those who acted wrongly to their own ruin, so that they lay prostrate lifeless in their own dwellings","11:95":"As though they had never lived there in affluence. So, away with the (people of) Midian, just as the Thamud have been done away with","11:96":"And We indeed sent Moses with Our clear signs (miracles to support him), and a manifest authority (from Us)","11:97":"To the Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they (his chiefs, his own people, and many among the Children of Israel) followed the rule of the Pharaoh; and the rule of the Pharaoh was by no means a guide right and just (and no tyrant in the mould of the Pharaoh has ever done differently)","11:98":"He will go before his people on the Day of Resurrection and lead them to the Fire (as cattle are led to water)!

His seizing is indeed painful, severe","11:103":"Surely in that is a sign (lesson and warning) for those who fear the punishment of the Hereafter.

Among them only a few, included among those whom We saved, did this. But those who did wrong (against God by associating partners with Him, and against people by violating their rights) were lost in the pursuit of pleasures without scruples, and were criminals committed to accumulating sins","11:117":"And it has never been the way of your Lord to destroy the townships unjustly while their people were righteous, dedicated to continuous self-reform and setting things right in the society","11:118":"If your Lord had so willed (and withheld from humankind free will), He would have made all humankind one single community (with the same faith, worldview, and life-pattern).

God always prevails in whatever be His Will, but most people do not know (that it is so)","12:22":"When Joseph reached his full manhood, We granted him authority with sound, wise judgment, and special knowledge.

Are many diverse lords more reasonable and better (to attribute creation to and believe in and obey), or God, the One, the All-Overwhelming (holding absolute sway over all that exists)","12:40":"What you worship apart from Him is nothing but names that you and your forefathers made up for them. (In the absolute sense) judgment and authority rest with none but God alone: He has commanded that you worship none but Him alone.

O you courtiers! Enlighten me about my dream, if you know how to interpret dreams","12:44":"They said: \"Jumbles of dream images. And we are not knowledgeable in the interpretation of dream images","12:45":"Now after all that time, of the two (prisoners) the one who had been delivered remembered (what Joseph had asked him to remember) and he said: \"I will inform you of its meaning, so send me forth","12:46":"(Coming to Joseph in the prison, he said): \"Joseph, O man of truth!

For sure my Lord has full knowledge of their guile (and my innocence)","12:51":"(The king had the woman assembled before him and) he said: \"What happened (between you and Joseph) when you sought to enjoy yourselves by him?\" They said: \"God save us! We perceived no evil at all on his part!\" And the wife of the minister said: \"Now the truth has come to light. It was I who sought to enjoy myself by him. He was indeed truthful (in all he said and true to his lord)","12:52":"(Joseph was informed of the women’s confessions and the declaration of his innocence.

He was fully accepted therein, able to go and execute his authority wherever he willed. We visit with Our mercy whomever We will. We do not leave to waste the reward of those devoted to doing good as if seeing God","12:57":"However, certainly the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety","12:58":"And (after some years) Joseph’s brothers came to Egypt and presented themselves before him: he knew them (at once), they did not recognize him","12:59":"When he provided them with their provisions, he said: \"Bring me (when you come next time) that (step) brother of yours by your father.

However, God is the Best as protector and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful","12:65":"Then when they opened their packs, they found that their merchandise had been returned to them. \"Father,\" they said, \"What more should we ask for? Here is our merchandise returned to us. So we will again be able to get provisions for our family! We will guard our brother and (his being with us) we will have an additional camel-load. That will be an easy gain","12:66":"He said: \"Never will I send him with you until you give me a solemn pledge in God’s Name that you will indeed bring him back to me, unless you are (in some insurmountable way) overwhelmed. Then, when they gave him their solemn pledge, he said: \"God is witness to and watcher over all that we say (and only on Him can we rely to fulfill our pledges)","12:67":"He said (by way of advice at the time of their departure): \"O my sons! Do not enter the city by one gate (in a single company), but enter by different gates. Yet I can be of no avail whatever to you against anything God wills. Judgment and authority rest with none but God alone. In Him have I put my trust, and whoever would entrust themselves should put their trust in Him","12:68":"They entered the city in the manner their father had enjoined on them, although this would have proved of no avail whatever to them against anything God had willed; it was but a need in Jacob’s soul, which he thus satisfied. For he was possessed of knowledge because We had taught it to him, but most people do not know (nor do they act according to the knowledge from God)","12:69":"And when they presented themselves before Joseph, he welcomed his brother to himself, and (having taken him aside) said: \"Surely it is I – I am your brother, so do not grieve over what they did","12:70":"Then when he had provided them with their provisions, he put the drinking-cup (belonging to him) in his brother’s saddlebag (as a gift). Then, (as they had just departed on their return) a herald called out: \"O you people of the caravan! You are surely thieves","12:71":"They said, turning towards them (the herald and his companions): \"What is it that you are missing","12:72":"They said: \"We are missing the king’s goblet, and whoever brings it shall receive a camel-load (as reward).\" (And the herald added:) \"I have pledged myself to recovering it","12:73":"They (the brothers) said: \"By God! Certainly you know well that we did not come to provoke disorder and corruption in this land, and we have never been thieves","12:74":"They said: \"What, then, shall be the penalty for it if you are proved liars","12:75":"They said: \"The penalty for it is: the (freedom of the) one in whose saddlebag it is found is the penalty for it. That is how we recompense the wrongdoers (who steal)","12:76":"(So they were brought back before Joseph to be searched.) He began with their sacks before his brother’s sack; and then he brought the drinking-cup out of his brother’s sack. In this way We made an arrangement for Joseph. Under the king’s law, he could not have detained his brother, had not God so willed. Whomsoever We will, We raise in ranks. Above every owner of knowledge there is (always) one more knowledgeable (until God Who is the All-Knowing)","12:77":"They (the other brothers) said: \"If he has stolen – well, a brother of his stole before.\" But Joseph (endured their false accusation in silence and) held it secret in his soul and did not disclose it to them. He said (to himself): \"You are indeed in a bad situation. God has full knowledge of (the truth of) what you allege","12:78":"O minister!\" they said: \"He has a father, a very old man; so take one of us in his place. We see that you are indeed of those devoted to selfless kindness","12:79":"He said: \"God forbid that we take any other but him with whom we found our merchandise; (if we did otherwise) then surely we (too) would be wrongdoers","12:80":"So, when they lost hope of moving him, they withdrew to take counsel among themselves. The eldest of them said: \"Do you not know how your father took a solemn pledge from you in God’s Name, and how, before that, you failed with regard to Joseph? Never will I depart from this land, until my father gives me leave, or God judges for me (by ending my life or enabling me to win back my brother). And He is the Best of judges","12:81":"Return to your father, and say: ‘Our father! Your son stole. We do not testify (to anything) except what we know; and we are not keepers of the Unseen","12:82":"‘Inquire in the township where we were, and the caravan with whom we traveled hither. We are certainly telling the truth.’","12:83":"(When they had returned to their father and made that speech to him) he said: \"No! Rather, your (evil-commanding) souls have tempted you to something. So (the proper recourse for me now is, again,) a becoming patience (a patience that endures without complaint). It may be that God will bring them back to me all together. He it is Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise","12:84":"He turned away from them and said: \"Alas, my grief for Joseph!\" And his eyes turned white because of the grief. And he was restraining (any resentment toward his other sons, never displaying it to them)","12:85":"They said: \"By God! You will not cease mentioning Joseph until you are consumed, or you perish","12:86":"He said: \"I only disclose my anguish and sorrow to God, and I know from God what you do not know","12:87":"He said (when once more seeing off his sons): \"O my sons, go forth and seek earnestly for Joseph and his brother; and do not despair of God’s Mercy, for none ever despairs of God’s Mercy, except people who disbelieve in Him","12:88":"They (went back to Egypt and once more) presented themselves before Joseph, saying: \"O minister! Hardship has visited us and our family, and we have brought only merchandise of scant worth; but fill up for us the measure and be charitable to us. Surely God rewards the charitable","12:89":"He said: \"Do you know what you did to Joseph and his brother at that time when you acted as if ignorant (of right and wrong)","12:90":"They said: \"Is it indeed you who are Joseph?\" He said: \"I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God has indeed been gracious to us. Surely whoever keeps from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety, and is patient – surely God will not leave to waste the reward of those devoted to doing good as if seeing God","12:91":"By God,\" they responded, \"God has indeed preferred you above us, and certainly we were sinful","12:92":"He said: \"No reproach this day shall be on you. May God forgive you; indeed He is the Most Merciful of the merciful","12:93":"Go with this shirt of mine and lay it over my father’s face, and he shall recover his sight; and come to me with all your people","12:94":"At the time that the (brothers’) caravan set out, their father said (to those around him): \"Surely, I sense the fragrance of Joseph, unless you would consider me a dotard","12:95":"By God,\" they said, \"you are indeed still lost in your old error","12:96":"But when the bearer of the good tidings came (with Joseph’s shirt), Jacob laid it over his face and he regained his sight. (Soon the caravan of the brothers reached home.) Jacob said: \"Did I not tell you that I know from God what you do not know","12:97":"(Jacob’s sons confessed what they had done.) They said: \"O our father! Ask God to forgive us our sins; surely we have been sinful","12:98":"He said: \"I will ask my Lord to forgive you. Surely He it is Who is the All-Forgiving, the All-Compassionate","12:99":"(When Jacob’s family reached Egypt,) they presented themselves before Joseph (who had come out to welcome them). He embraced his parents, and said (addressing all those who came): \"Enter Egypt by God’s will in security (free from fear of privation or grief)","12:100":"He raised his parents on the throne and they all bowed down before Joseph (as a sign of loyalty to him). He said: \"O my father! This is the meaning of my dream of long ago; my Lord has made it come true. He has indeed been gracious to me: He freed me from prison, and He brought you all from the desert after Satan had sown discord between me and my brothers. Truly, my Lord is subtly kind in the way He brings about whatever He wills. Surely, He it is Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise","12:101":"My Lord! You have indeed granted me some important part of the rule and imparted to me some knowledge of the inner meaning of all happenings (including dreams). O You, Originator of the heavens and the earth each with particular features! You are my Owner and Guardian in this world and in the Hereafter. Take my soul to You a Muslim, and join me with the righteous","12:102":"That is an account of some exemplary events of the unseen (a realm and time beyond the reach of any created being’s perception) that We reveal to you, (O Messenger). You were not with them when those agreed upon their plans, and then were scheming (against Joseph)","12:103":"Yet, be you ever so eager, most people will not believe","12:104":"You do not ask them any wage for it (for conveying the Qur’an to them). It is but a message and reminder to all conscious beings","12:105":"How many a sign there is in the heavens and earth that they pass by, being unmindful of the signs and giving no consideration to them","12:106":"And most of them do not even believe in God without associating partners with Him","12:107":"Do they deem themselves secure that there will not come upon them an overwhelming punishment of God, which will envelop them thoroughly, or that the Last Hour will not come upon them all of a sudden, without their being aware (of its coming)","12:108":"Say (to them, O Messenger): \"This is my way: I call to God on clear evidence and with sure knowledge – I and those who follow me.

Have they never traveled about the earth and beheld how was the outcome for those who came before them (those who persisted in associating partners with Him and in wrongdoing and transgression)? Assuredly, the abode of the Hereafter is best for those who keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety. Will you not, then, reason and understand","12:110":"So far so that when they (the earlier Messengers who all had to suffer much persecution for a long time) nearly lost hope and were convinced that they were denied, Our help came to them. And whoever We willed was saved. But Our mighty punishment cannot be averted from the guilty people committed to accumulating sin","12:111":"Indeed, in their exemplary life-stories there is a significant lesson for people of discernment. It (the Qur’an, which contains them) is not a discourse fabricated, but (a Divine Book revealed as) a confirmation of (the Divine authorship of and the truths still contained by) the Revelations prior to it, and an explanation of everything, and a guidance and mercy for people who will and do believe","13:1":"Alif.

You have certainly done an awful thing","18:72":"He said: \"Did I not tell you that you would never be able to bear patiently with my company","18:73":"He (Moses) said: \"Do not take me to task because I forgot, and do not overburden me in my affair (in what you ask of me)","18:74":"So they went on until, when they met a young boy, he (al-Khadr) killed him. (Moses) said: \"Have you killed an innocent soul (not in lawful retaliation but) without his having killed anyone? Assuredly you have done a horrible thing","18:75":"He said: \"Did I not tell you that you would never be able to have patience with being in my company","18:76":"(Moses) said: \"If I should ever question you about anything after this, keep me no more in your company. You have already received (full) excuse from me","18:77":"So they went on until when they came upon the people of a township, they asked its people for food, but they refused them hospitality. They found there a wall which was on the verge of tumbling down, and he (al-Khadr) restored it. (Moses) said: \"If you had wished, you could have taken payment for it","18:78":"He (al-Khadr) said: \"This is the parting of ways between me and you. I will tell you the meaning of what you were unable to bear patiently","18:79":"As for the boat, it belonged to some destitute people who worked on the sea – and I wished to damage it, for there was a king after them who was seizing every boat by force","18:80":"And as for the young boy, his parents were believers, and we feared lest he should oppress them with rebellion and unbelief","18:81":"So we wished that their Lord would grant them in his place one better than him in purity and nearer in affection (to his parents)","18:82":"And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and beneath it was a treasure belonging to them. Their father had been a righteous man. So your Lord willed that they should come of age and bring forth their treasure as a mercy from your Lord. I did not do this (any of the actions that you witnessed) of my own accord. This is the meaning of all (those events) with which you were unable to have patience","18:83":"And they ask you (O Messenger) about Dhu’l-Qarnayn. Say: \"I will recite to you a mention of him (quoting the Almighty)","18:84":"We surely established him with power in the land, and for everything (that he rightly purposed) We granted him a way (the just means appropriate to just ends)","18:85":"One such way he followed","18:86":"Until, when he reached the setting-place of the sun, he saw it setting in a spring of hot and black muddy water, and nearby he found a people. We said: \"O Dhu’l-Qarnayn! You can either punish them or you can treat them with kindness. (Which way will you choose)","18:87":"He said: \"As for him who does wrong (by disbelieving in Him or associating partners with Him and oppressing others) we will punish him and then he is brought back to his Lord, and He punishes him in an indescribable manner","18:88":"But as for him who believes and does good, righteous deeds, for him the recompense of the best is due, and we will speak to him an easy word of Our command (we will charge him with easy tasks)","18:89":"Then he followed another way","18:90":"Until, when he reached the rising-place of the sun and found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shelter against it","18:91":"So it was (such was their state and the extent of Dhu’l-Qarnayn’s power). We assuredly encompassed all concerning him in Our Knowledge","18:92":"Then he followed another way","18:93":"Until, when he reached (a place) between two mountain-barriers, he found before them a people who scarcely understood a word","18:94":"They said: \"O Dhu’l-Qarnayn! Gog and Magog are causing disorder in this land. May we pay you a tribute so that you set a barrier between us and them","18:95":"He said: \"What my Lord has established me in (the power that He has granted me on this earth) is better (than what you offer). So help me with strength (manpower) and I will set a strong rampart between you and them","18:96":"Bring me blocks of iron.\" Then, after he had filled up (the space between) the two steep mountain-sides, he said: \"(Light a fire and) work your bellows!\" At length, when he had made it (glow red like) fire, he said: \"Bring me molten copper that I may pour upon it","18:97":"And they (Gog and Magog) were no longer able to surmount, nor were they able to dig their way through (the barrier)","18:98":"Dhu’l-Qarnayn said: \"This is a mercy from my Lord. Yet when the time of my Lord’s promise comes, He will level it down to the ground; and my Lord’s promise is ever true","18:99":"On that day We will leave people to surge like waves on one another; and the Trumpet will be blown, then We will gather them all together","18:100":"And on that Day We will place Hell before the unbelievers, plain to view","18:101":"Those whose eyes are veiled from My Book and any remembrance of Me, and who cannot bear to hear (them)","18:102":"Do they who disbelieve reckon that they can (rightly and justifiably) take any of My servants as guardians (to own and protect them) besides Me? Assuredly, We have prepared Hell to welcome the unbelievers","18:103":"Say: \"Shall We inform you who are the greatest losers in respect of their deeds","18:104":"Those whose endeavor has been wasted in this world (because it is directed only to this-worldly ends, and so it is bound to be wasted hereafter also) but who themselves reckon that they are doing good","18:105":"They are those who disbelieve in the signs and Revelations of their Lord, and in the meeting with Him. Hence, their deeds have come to nothing, and on the Day of Resurrection We will not accord to them any weight","18:106":"That will be their recompense – Hell – because they have disbelieved and taken My signs and Revelations and My Messengers in mockery","18:107":"Surely for those who believe and do good, righteous deeds, their welcome is Gardens of the highest level of Paradise","18:108":"Therein will they abide, without desiring any change therefrom","18:109":"Say: \"If all the sea were ink to write my Lord’s words (the acts, decrees, and manifestations of all His Names and Attributes), the sea would indeed be exhausted before my Lord’s words are exhausted, even if We were to bring the like of it in addition to it","18:110":"Say: \"I am but a mortal like you, but it is revealed to me that your God is the One and Only God.

Your Lord says: ‘It is easy for Me – assuredly I did create you before, when you had been nothing.’","19:10":"(Zachariah) prayed: \"My Lord, appoint a sign for me.\" \"Your sign,\" He said, \"is that you will not be able to speak to people for three nights","19:11":"So he (Zachariah) came out to his people from the sanctuary (where he had been praying in the Temple), and signified to them: \"Glorify your Lord at daybreak and in the afternoon","19:12":"(John was born and when he grew up, We commanded him:) \"O John! Hold fast to the Book (the Torah) with (all your) strength!\" And We granted him sound, wise judgment (and true understanding of God’s Law) while he was yet a little boy","19:13":"And (the gift of) compassion from Our Presence, and purity. He was very pious and righteous","19:14":"And dutiful towards his parents, and he was never unruly, rebellious","19:15":"So peace be upon him on the day he was born and the day of his death, and the day when he will be raised to life","19:16":"And make mention, in the Book, of Mary. She withdrew from her family to a chamber (in the Temple) facing east (to devote herself to worship and reflection)","19:17":"Thus she kept herself in seclusion from people. Then We sent to her Our spirit, and it appeared before her in the form of a perfect man","19:18":"She said: \"I seek refuge in the All-Merciful from you, if you are a pious, God-conscious one","19:19":"He replied: \"I am only a messenger of your Lord to be a means (for God’s gift) to you of a pure son","19:20":"She said: \"How shall I have a son, seeing no mortal has ever touched me, and I have never been unchaste","19:21":"He said: \"Just so. Your Lord says: ‘It is easy for Me; and (it must be just so) so that We make him for humankind a sign (of Our Power on account of his birth) and a mercy from Us (on account of his being a Messenger).

There has indeed come to me of knowledge (of truth) such as has never come to you, so follow me, and I will guide you to an even, straight path","19:44":"O my father! Do not worship Satan (by obeying his whispering to you to worship idols)! Satan is ever rebellious against the All-Merciful","19:45":"O my father! I am fearful lest a punishment from the All-Merciful befall you, and then you will become a close friend of Satan (and an instrument in his hand)","19:46":"His father said: \"Have you turned away from my deities, O Abraham?

Do not fabricate lies against God (such as falsely describing His clear proofs as sorcery, falsely pretending that His Message to you aims at driving you out of your land, and by adopting other deities than Him), lest He ruin you with a severe scourge. Whoever fabricates a lie is doomed","20:62":"(Moses’ warning having influenced some among the sorcerers and the Pharaoh’s men,) they began to debate their affair among themselves, holding a secret counsel","20:63":"(The Pharaoh’s men spoke to the sorcerers, and) they said: \"These two men are surely sorcerers intent on driving you out of your land with their sorcery, and doing away with your exemplary way of life","20:64":"So gather your devices, and then come in ordered ranks (as an organized, unified force), for the one who gains the upper hand today has surely triumphed","20:65":"They (the sorcerers) said: \"Moses, either you throw or we will be the first to throw","20:66":"He said: \"No, you throw first!\" And there and then, by their sorcery, their ropes and their staffs seemed to him to be slithering","20:67":"Then Moses felt in his soul a bit apprehensive (that people may have been influenced by their sorcery)","20:68":"We said: \"Do not fear! You surely, you are the uppermost","20:69":"Throw that which is in your right hand: it will swallow up all that they have contrived. What they have contrived is only a sorcerer’s artifice. And a sorcerer can never prosper whatever he may aim at","20:70":"And so (it happened, and) the sorcerers were thrown down, prostrate. They proclaimed: \"We have come to believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses","20:71":"(The Pharaoh) said: \"Do you believe in Him before I give you leave? I see that he (Moses) is your master who taught you sorcery! I will surely have your hands and feet cut off alternately, and have you crucified on the trunks of palm-trees, and you will certainly come to know which of us (– the Lord of Aaron and Moses or I –) is more severe in punishment and (whose punishment is) more lasting","20:72":"They said: \"We will never prefer you above the clear evidence (manifesting the truth) that has come before us, and above Him Who originated us. So decree whatever you decree: you can decree only for the life of this world","20:73":"We have surely come to believe in our Lord and (we hope) that He may forgive us our faults and that sorcery to which you compelled us. God is the best (in giving reward), and the most permanent","20:74":"Whoever comes before his Lord as a disbelieving criminal, for him surely there will be Hell: he will neither die therein nor live","20:75":"Whereas he who comes before Him as a believer who did good, righteous deeds, for such are high ranks and lofty stations –","20:76":"Gardens of perpetual bliss through which rivers flow, therein to abide. Such is the recompense of whoever attains to purity","20:77":"We revealed to Moses: \"Set forth with My servants by night, and (when you reach the sea’s edge with the Pharaoh and his army in pursuit) strike for them a dry path with your staff through the sea, and you need have no fear of being overtaken (by Pharaoh) or of drowning in the sea","20:78":"Then the Pharaoh pursued them with his armed hosts, and they were overwhelmed by the sea to their complete destruction","20:79":"The Pharaoh had led his people astray (and finally he led them to destruction); he did not guide them (either to the truth or to prosperity)","20:80":"O Children of Israel! We saved you from your enemy; and We made a covenant with you through Moses on the right side of Mount Sinai (and granted you the Torah); and We sent down on you manna and quails (to sustain you in the desert)","20:81":"(We said:) Eat of the pure, wholesome things that We have provided for you but do not exceed the bounds therein (by wastefulness, ingratitude, unlawful earnings, and the like). Otherwise My condemnation will justly fall upon you, and upon whoever My wrath falls, he has indeed thrown himself into ruin","20:82":"Yet I am surely All-Forgiving to whoever repents and believes and does good, righteous deeds, and thereafter keeps himself on the right path","20:83":"(When Moses came to Our appointment with him in Mount Sinai to receive the Torah, We asked him:) \"Moses, what has caused you to leave your people behind in such haste","20:84":"He replied: \"They are following in my footsteps; and I have shown haste to come to You so that You may be well-pleased with Me","20:85":"(God) said: \"Then (know that) We have put your people to a test in your absence, and the Samiri (Samaritan) has led them astray","20:86":"So Moses returned to his people in anger and sorrow. He said: \"My people! Did your Lord not make you a fair promise (that He would grant you the Torah for your happiness in both worlds and settle you in the land the environs of which He has blessed)? Did, then, the time appointed (for my absence) seem too long to you or did you desire that a condemnation from your Lord should fall upon you, that you broke your promise to me","20:87":"They said: \"We did not break our promise to you of our own accord (with intent), but we were loaded with (sinful) loads of ornaments of the people (of Egypt), and we threw them (to get rid of them), in the same way as the Samiri threw (them, into a fire)","20:88":"And then he brought out for them a calf shaping to it (from the molten ornaments) a body (which made a sound like) mooing. Then they said (some of them to others): \"This is your deity and the deity of Moses, but he has forgotten","20:89":"Did they not see at all that (even) it could not return to them a word (for answer), and had no power to harm or benefit them","20:90":"And Aaron had certainly said to them, before Moses’ return, (warning them:) \"O my people! You are only being tested through this (idol to prove the quality of your understanding and faith). Truly Your Lord is the All-Merciful (Who is most forgiving), so follow me and obey my order","20:91":"But they said: \"We will by no means cease to worship it until Moses comes back to us","20:92":"(Having returned, and unaware of Aaron’s warning, Moses) said: \"O Aaron! What prevented you, when you saw them gone astray","20:93":"From following me? Have you, then, disobeyed my order","20:94":"Aaron said: \"O son of my mother! Do not seize me by my beard, nor by my head! I was afraid lest you should say: ‘You have caused division among the Children of Israel, and paid no heed to my orders!’","20:95":"(Moses turned to the Samiri and) said: \"What is the matter with you, O Samiri, (that you did such a monstrous thing)","20:96":"He answered: \"I have seen something which they were unable to see, and so I took a handful (of dust) from the trail of the messenger (the archangel Gabriel) and cast it into the molten ornaments: thus did my soul prompt me to act","20:97":"(Moses) said: \"Be gone, then! (The sentence) upon you is that in this present life you say ‘Touch me not!’ (to warn people against proximity to you), and surely there is for you a promise (of punishment) that you cannot evade. Now look to this deity of yours to whose worship you have become devoted: we will most certainly burn it, and scatter whatever remains of it over the sea","20:98":"(O my people!) Your only deity is God, other than Whom there is no deity. He encompasses all things in His Knowledge","20:99":"Thus do We relate to you (O Messenger) some of the exemplary events which happened in the past.

Do not show haste (O Messenger) with (the receiving and memorizing of any Revelation included in) the Qur’an before it has been revealed to you in full, but say: \"My Lord, increase me in knowledge","20:115":"Assuredly We had made a covenant with Adam (and forbidden him to approach a tree in the Garden), but he acted forgetfully. We did not find resolve in him (at that moment)","20:116":"And when We said to the angels, \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam,\" they all prostrated themselves. But Iblis did not; he refused","20:117":"So We said: \"O Adam, surely this is an enemy to you and your wife; so let him not drive the two of you out of the Garden, lest you become distressed","20:118":"Surely it is provided for you that you shall not go hungry therein nor become naked","20:119":"And that you shall not go thirsty therein nor suffer the sun’s heat","20:120":"But Satan made an evil suggestion, saying: \"O Adam, shall I lead you to the tree of everlasting life and a kingdom that will never decay","20:121":"They both ate of it, so their shameful parts (and all the seemingly evil impulses in their creation) were apparent to them, and both began to cover themselves with leaves from the Garden. Adam disobeyed his Lord and fell into error","20:122":"Thereafter his Lord chose him (for His favor), accepted His repentance, and bestowed His guidance upon him","20:123":"We said: \"Go down from here, the two of you, all together (with Satan, and henceforth you will live a life,) some of you being the enemies of others.

Surely I am in need of whatever good you may send down to me","28:25":"Thereafter one of the two (maidens) approached him, walking bashfully, and said: \"My father invites you, so that he may reward you for watering our flock for us.\" So when he came to him and told him the whole of his story, he said: \"Worry no longer! You are now safe from the wrongdoing, oppressive people","28:26":"One of the two daughters said: \"Father, employ him, for the best whom you could employ should be one strong and trustworthy (as he is)","28:27":"(The father) said to Moses: \"I want to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you if you serve me for eight years (according to the lunar calendar).

You will find me, God willing, one of the righteous","28:28":"(Moses) answered: \"So let it be between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I fulfill, let there be no ill-will against me. God is a Guarantor over what we say","28:29":"When Moses fulfilled the term and was traveling with his family (in the desert) he perceived a fire from the direction of the Mount (Sinai).
