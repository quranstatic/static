There and then were they stamped with humiliation and misery and came within the measure of Allah's wrath. This was in the train of their denial of Allah's revelations and signs demonstrating Omnipotence and Authority and of bringing death unjustifiably upon the Prophets of their own nation.

Mussa said: Allah says: \"It is a vivid yellow cow particularly attractive to beholders","2:70":"Again they said to Mussa: \"Beseech Allah, your Creator, on our behalf to specify the characteristic features of the cow since to us all cows are alike, and Allah willing we will be able to find the cow meeting the said features","2:71":"Mussa said: \"Allah says it is a cow that has not been used in ploughing the land nor watering the fields, a cow free of all physical defects.\" There and then they said to Mussa: \"Now you have brought us the truth,\" and they slaughtered the cow in sacrifice in spite of hesitation though they almost did not","2:72":"And you slew a man and the case was wrapped in mystery and you all tried to absolve yourselves of the blood guilt, but Allah would not permit it and He exposed the truth which you tried to conceal","2:73":"Their and then We commanded Mussa to say to you: \"Strike the corpse with a piece of the heifer’s carcass,\" and there the man was brought to life only for as long as he made known in a supernatural manner, the name of the man who had killed him.

And when they are with their like-minded companions they are reprehended for conversing with the Muslims on Muhammad's mission documented in AL-Tawrah previously when assenting to this truth is against their interest; They say to them: \"Do you reveal to the Muslims knowledge Allah entrusted to us so that they use it against us in the venerable, Majestic presence of Allah, your Creator; Have you no sense as to exercise the faculty of reason","2:77":"Do they not know that Allah knows what they exchange secretly or whisper and what they suggest secretly and all feelings stored in their hearts, and He is well acquainted with all they utter out loud","2:78":"Among them are illiterates who do not know the precepts nor the mandates according with AL-Tawrah’s texts; they only know what the demagogic rabbi had purposed, and the knowledge they imparted was wholly infested with falsehood yielding only false hopes vested with ignorance and illiteracy, thus affording conjecture","2:79":"In cconsequence, woe upon those who reproduce Allah’s Book by wording it differently in a demagogic way, distorting meanings and relating them to Allah in order to exchange the truth for the vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world. Woe betide them for their wrongful and unclean hands, they shall be miserable as a result of their sinful iniquities","2:80":"They say: \"Fire will not touch us but for a certain number of days\". Say to them, O Muhammad: \"Was that a promise Allah made to you granting you future security against vindication and in consequence you are relieved, knowing that Allah never breaks His promise!

When some of them fall into captivity you revert to the principles in AL-Tawrah and redeem them, albeit the same principles forbid you to shed your own blood nor to expel each other from your homes. Do you people credit part of the Book upon the ground of Allah’s Authority and discredit part upon the ground of your authority? Indeed, he who adopts this line of conduct shall suffer for his offence; he shall be lost to shame here. Such persons shall be delivered to the abyss with its torrential scorching and roaring flames Hereafter; they shall suffer torment and be put to torture; and Allah is not unaware of what you do","2:86":"These people, O Muhammad, have exchanged the Hereafter for here below, with gazes fixed upon the world and its vanities; their suffering shall never abate nor shall their excruciating pain be mitigated nor can anyone help them out of their misery","2:87":"You, Bani Isra‘il, know that We gave Mussa AL-Tawrah and We sent other Prophets sequentially: We sent ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam, with clear revelations and signs guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and enlightenment, and We supported him by giving him countenance by the Holy Spirit. Yet is it not indeed incredible that as often as a Prophet is sent to you with divine principles not to your taste, you become extravagant in your account of yourselves and display inordinate self-confidence? Some you renounce and some you accuse of assuming false character, and others you kill or you conspire their death","2:88":"They say to you, O Muhammad: \"Our hearts’ ears are deaf, and our hearts treasure every branch of divine knowledge and wisdom that we can no longer absorb.\" The fact is Allah has cursed them for their irreverence and impiety. How their faith in Allah is shaken","2:89":"When a Book was presented to them from Heaven, a Book , a treasure purposed to this life and life beyond, corroborating AL-Tawrah, they refused to accept it although it clearly foretold the Prophet Muhammad's coming; an event they had always been expecting and at times wishing it be hastened on to help them get the upper hand in argument and gain advantages in arguments and victories in wars over those who deny Allah. Yet when the prophesy was fulfilled and the Prophet Muhammad came with the Quran, they refused to acknowledge the truth of his mission. Consequently, Allah has consigned those who deny Him to misery and their homes shall be cursed","2:90":"How worthless is the price they received for selling their souls to immorality and wickedness, inequitably rejecting the truth received from Allah guiding into all truth; a defying impiety induced by transgression -natural to them- and by base envy reflecting sincere hatred upon those whom Allah Has mercifully granted, the prerogative of Prophethood, an unreachable excellence. There and then they came again within the measure of Allah's wrath and incurred wrath upon wrath, and the punishment is humiliating to those who deny Allah and ignore His commands","2:91":"And when they are told to acknowledge the statutes Allah has imparted to the Prophet Muhammad, the last of Allah’s Messengers carrying the enacted law entrusted by Allah, they say: \"We only acknowledge what has been imparted to us,\" and they deny and renounce all else when they know the truth validating AL- Tawrah.

And your people said: \"We have opened our hearts' ears \" But their actions did not accord to their words. They impiously took the calf and drank with delight, to tame their wicked feelings. Say to them, O Muhammad: \"If these are the principles of your faith steering your course of action, then how worthless is your apprehension of divine truth and system of religious belief, if you truly represent yourselves as people of faith","2:94":"Say to them, O Muhammad: \"If you truly believe in eternal bliss, excluding all else then wish yourselves dead if you declare the truth","2:95":"But never shall they wish their death because of what their wrongful hands have committed; and Allah knows the wrongful well","2:96":"You shall find them, O Muhammad, of all people, the most eager, for longevity, even more than the Pagans, none of them aims for the grave but would rather be entangled in the web of life for a thousand years.

In fact, most of them are faithlessly disposed","2:101":"And when the prophesy in the authentic AL-Tawrah was fulfilled and the Prophet Muhammad arrived carrying the final message from Allah with the Quran validating AL-Tawrah, some of them shut their eyes to the prophesy ignoring their own Book which conforms to the will of Allah and turned their backs upon it as if they were never aware","2:102":"And they pursued vanity and neglected religion; they were attracted to characteristics befitting AL-Shayatin who attributed Sulayman's (Solomon) prerogative of Prophethood and power to the art of sorcery and occult qualities; a defying impiety and a serious offence for which Sulayman was innocent. In fact it was the blasphemers who defied Allah. They taught people necromancy which they practised through contact with evil spirits and through the knowledge they acquired from revelations imparted to the two angelic Babylonians Harut and Marut. But Harut and Marut made it clear that their art was a source of temptation and an incitement to evil and they cautioned against indulgence as it meant defiance to Allah. Yet those blasphemers pursued the evil aspect of this art using those spirits to sow discord between husband and wife and other similar evil acts. Nonetheless no one suffers harm unless divinely predetermined. They applied themselves to learning the art which inflicts harm upon them and they derive no profit from it. Yet they knew that he who engages in sorcery for vice shall have no bliss of the Hereafter; how worthless was the price they received for selling their own souls to immorality and wickedness if they only knew","2:103":"Had they truthfully believed in Allah and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Him, Allah would have been their hope and His mercy and blessings would have been far better than what they lost if they only knew","2:104":"O you, faithful believers: Do not address the Prophet in Hebrew disrespectfully. Do not say \"Ra’ina\" when you desire His attention, instead say, \"‘Unzurna\" or turn your attention directing your eye upon us; and those who defy Allah shall endure torture","2:105":"Neither the faithless of Ahl al-Kitab who defy Allah nor the Pagans wish that you receive Allah’s mercy and blessings, but Allah extends His mercy to whom He will. He is the source of sufficient grace abounding in whom He will and of the efficacious grace effecting ends","2:106":"They question, O Muhammad, the wisdom of abrogation in certain circumstances. None of Our revelations or signs, secondary in character, do We terminate, but We replace it with a better or equivalent substitute; do you not know that Allah is Qadirun (Omnipotent) to effect all things","2:107":"Do you not know that the Sovereign Authority and the supreme control of the heavens and earth resides with Allah, and besides Him you people have no guardian nor can any one afford you help","2:108":"Or do you people wish to challenge your Prophet to produce supernatural acts as Mussa was challenged to perform earlier by his contemporaries who demanded to see Allah personally? Indeed, he who exchanges Faith for disbelief will have wronged himself and wandered from the path of righteousness","2:109":"Many of Ahl al-Kitab wish they could turn you renegades, a desire induced by base envy reflecting sincere hatred for you people who have conformed to Islam, even though they have recognized the truth. Nevertheless, forgive them and do not entertain them with antagonistic thoughts until Allah circumstances matters of fact in His own manner and His command comes to pass. Allah is indeed Qadirun over all in all","2:110":"And participate in the act of divine worship, giving zakat, for zakat is but a vehicle of prayer, and whatever you advance of piety toward future security, you shall find preserved in heaven’s realm. Allah is Bassirun (Omnipresent): He sees all that you do","2:111":"And in their way of thinking they say: \"No one shall be admitted to Paradise and enjoy the bliss and surpassing beauty of the Hereafter but he who conforms to Judaism or Christianity\". This is the imagination.they entertain Say to them, O Muhammad: \"Produce your convincing evidence if you declare the truth","2:112":"But it is only he who gives a good impression to Allah, serving His purpose with wise and pious deeds: who shall find a pleasing reward in heaven’s realm and no fear or dread shall fall upon him nor shall he come to grief","2:113":"And yet the Jews say: \"The Christians are prone to a system not based upon truth.\" And the Christians say: \"The Jews rely on a religion without the groundwork of truth, while both of them learn from the same Book.\" Without much knowledge of the Book, the Pagans said this but Allah shall judge them in Day of Judgement* in matters concerning their variance","2:114":"And who is more wrong-minded than he who blocks the way to places of divine worship by placing obstacles and intends to destroy them in attempt to prevent religious observance and to preclude the adoration of Allah's Eternal Name Such persons were not to enter these places except secretly, fearing for their life. They shall suffer disgrace and multiple humiliations here, and be put to the torture Hereafter","2:115":"And to Allah belong the East with its four cardinal points where the sun rises and the West with its four cardinal points where the sun sets, and therefore to whichever point in the universe you turn you shall be in Allah's August Presence. Allah is Wasi’un (Omnipresent),and 'Alimun","2:116":"And yet they say: \"Allah has begotten a son.\" Glory be to Him, His glorious attributes extolled, but to Him all that exists in the heavens and earth belong to Him and all exercise a submissive reverence to His Authority","2:117":"He is it Who generated the heavens and earth and when He ordains something He only says: \"Be\" and it is","2:118":"And those who are so ignorant to know the truth vented their hearts, which are overflowing with the sense of sin, they said: “If only Allah would speak to us or display a sign evincing both Muhammad's Prophethood and integrity!” This much said those who preceded them who had similar natured hearts as those who succeeded them. Their thoughts are so base, pursuing vanity. We have expounded Our revelations and signs evincing both Omnipotence and Authority to people who lift to Allah their inward sight","2:119":"We have sent you, O Muhammad, with the truth as a spectacle and a warning to all, and you shall not be responsible for those who are born to be fuel for the fires of Hell","2:120":"In fact, neither the Jews nor the Christians shall be pleased with you, O Muhammad until you conform to their system of faith. Say to them: \"Indeed it is only the course steered by Allah the one and only way that leads to the path of righteousness with Providence as the guide. And should you be tempted to follow their wishes, given the knowledge imparted to you, then do not expect Allah to maintain you under His tutelage","2:121":"Those people to whom We gave AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil, who read their Book with careful scrutiny in search of truth, shall recognize what really proceeded from Allah and what has been adulterated by base admixture of false glosses. Such persons shall comprehend the truth and accordingly honour the Quran. And he who refuses to acknowledge the truth proceeded from Allah shall be an inherent loser","2:122":"O you Bani Isra‘il: \"Render solemn acknowledgement of My divine favour and impel yourselves with the feeling of gratitude to Me for the efficacious grace I conferred upon you and that I confined you to such prerogative as to be chosen* out of all people for My mercy and blessings","2:123":"Guard yourselves from the horror of the Day when no soul shall be allowed to pay the debt owed to Allah by another, nor shall the equivalent in ransom pay for the expiation of the guilt of one soul or another, nor shall humble intercession be accepted from anyone on behalf of another, nor shall any tutelary protector other than Allah be of any help in the inevitable trouble","2:124":"For once Allah tested Ibrahim with divine commands which Ibrahim had fulfilled. In response Allah said to him: \"I have ordained to appoint you as the Imam, or religious leader, of mankind\". \"Will this apply to my descendants?\" asked Ibrahim. \"My appointment,\" said Allah, \"is not designated to the wrong- minded","2:125":"We ordained the Sacred House -the Ka’ba- a safe retreat for people, that you Muslims take Ibrahim’s station where he performed the prescribed acts of devotion, as a place of prayer. And We committed Ibrahim and Isma‘il to cleanse My House from moral and spiritual defilement and to impart real sacredness upon it and ceremonially purify it for those who revolve in it in procession ,for those who retreat for religious observance, for those who kneel in supplication, prostrating mentally and willfully acknowledging Allah's Omnipotence, perfection and Authority, and those who prostrate their reason to divine revelation","2:126":"Then Ibrahim made a devout and humble supplication to Allah to bless the city of Macca. He prayed: “I beseech You, Allah, my Creator, to make this city a safe retreat affording security and peace of mind. And provision its people with the earth’s kind fruits favouring those among them who believed in Allah and in Day of Judgement with hearts impressed with religious and spiritual virtues.” “Quite the contrary”, Allah said, “but also he who shall be denied the heaven's bliss I will satisfy in life. I make him hold and enjoy the same to a predetermined point, then I will drive him into Hell. How evil is his destiny!”","2:127":"And as Ibrahim and Isma‘il were laying the foundation of the Sacred House they prayed: \"O Allah, our Creator, accept this service from us. You are AL- Bassir with unlimited audition, AL-'Alim","2:128":"And make out of both of us, O Allah, our Creator, two Muslims who conform their will to Yours and of our descendants a Muslim nation who conforms their will to Yours. And show us our rites and articles of our faith and the prescribed order of performing religious and other devotional services and turn to us in mercy; You are AL-Tawab (the Relenting),and AL-Rahim,(the Merciful)","2:129":"And send in their midst, O Allah, our Creator, a Prophet from among them to recite Your revelations, to teach them the Book, to acquaint their hearts with wisdom and to impart sanctity unto them; You are AL-Aziz(Almighty),and AL- Hakim (the Source of wisdom)","2:130":"Who would reject Ibrahim’s system of faith and worship but a deranged fool? We have conferred such a prerogative confined to him here, and he shall be among the virtuous and nearest to Allah Hereafter","2:131":"When Allah said to him: \"Conform your will to Mine\", he answered: \"I vow to resign myself to Allah, Creator of the universe, and conform my will to His blessed will","2:132":"There and then Ibrahim bequeathed this rich legacy to his sons as later did his grandson Ya’qub (Jacob); they both enjoined their sons to the same belief. \"O my Sons\", they said, \"Allah has chosen for you a particular system of faith and worship, you are enjoined to observe and practice it, therefore, adhere to it so that when death lays its hands upon you, and you pass through his door you will have conformed your will to Allah's blessed will","2:133":"Or you people were present when Ya’qub lay on his deathbed and you testify that he enjoined his sons to adhere to a system of faith other than Islam? In fact, you knew well that on his deathbed Ya’qub gathered his sons and said to them: \"Whom shall you worship after I have departed life?\" they said: \"We will pay reverence to Allah, your Allah, the Ilah of your fathers, Ibrahim, Isma‘il and Ishak (Isaac), One Ilah to Whom we display our devotion and adoration by appropriate acts and rites conforming our will to His blessed wil\"l","2:134":"These were a people who passed through nature to Eternity; they are accountable for their deeds and you are accountable for yours, and you shall not be responsible for their deeds","2:135":"Yet once more Ahl Al-Kitab explicitly say: \"Be Jews or Christians, and thus be guided into all truth\". Say to them, O Muhammad: \"But rather the religion of Ibrahim as the true and straightforward, and his system of faith and worship; never did he incorporate with Allah other deities","2:136":"O Muslims, declare thus: \"We believe in Allah and in all that has been imparted to us and in the Quran and in all that was imparted to Ibrahim and Isma‘il, Ishaq and Ya’qub and to the tribes of his twelve sons and to Mussa and ‘Isa.

Our hearts surge up and answer sincere thanks to Him","2:140":"Or do you claim that Ibrahim and Isma‘il, Ishak and Ya’qub and the Tribes were Jews or Christians when you know that AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil were sent down to Mussa and ‘Isa, founders of Judaism and Christianity? Do you know better than Allah, AL-Sami’ and AL-’Alim? Who is more wrongful than he who hides an attestation from Allah? Allah is not unaware of all you do","2:141":"These were a people who have passed through nature to Eternity; they are accountable for their actions and you are accountable for yours, and you shall not be responsible for their deeds","2:142":"And the fool among the people, were excited by the perception of an unexpected and inexplicable, bewildering event, so they began to speak their thoughts; they said: \"What made the Muslims change their Qiblah, the direction to which they turn at prayer?\" Say to them, O Muhammad: \"To Allah belong the East with its four cardinal points where the sun rises and the West with its four cardinal points where the sun sets; He guides whom He will to the path of righteousness","2:143":"Thus We made an ‘Umma (nation) of you Muslims with balanced reason so that you be witnesses of peoples’ actions characterizing their rival systems. The Prophet would be a witness of your actions, and your deeds are a witness of your worth. We initially established AL-Quds as the Kiblah toward which you, Muhammad, turned in prayer distinguishing those who obey the Prophet and exposing the disobedient who turn on their heels, reversing their position. This was hard on those with the rich legacy of Ibrahim before them but they bowed to Providence as their guide. Allah was not going to annul your religious and spiritual virtues, for Allah displays kindness to those who serve Him and those who do not: His mercy is extended to all","2:144":"We have seen you, O Muhammad, turning your face skyward in expectation of something desired, hopeful of a change relative to Ibrahim, leader of mankind. Thus, We will appoint a Kiblah for you to meet your expectation. Therefore, wherever you may be, turn your face in prayer toward the Sacred Mosque, the Ka’ba at Macca. As for Ahl Al-Kitab, they know this to be the truth from Allah, their Creator, and Allah is not unaware of all they do","2:145":"If you, Muhammad, were to present Ahl Al-Kitab with signs evincing your Prophethood and Allah’s Omnipotence and Authority, they shall never follow your Kiblah nor shall you follow theirs, nor shall they follow each other’s Qiblah, and should you be tempted to follow their vain wishes given the knowledge imparted to you, then you will miss the path of righteousness and indeed be wrong","2:146":"In fact, Ahl Al-Kitab received the Scriptures from Us foretelling all present events. They know the truth of your mission very well. They know of the Quran and the Qiblah and assert their existence as much as their sons’ identity, but some of them hide the evident truth","2:147":"But the truth has proceeded to you, O Muhammad, from Allah, your Creator, therefore do not permit their false assertions to cause you doubt and anxiety","2:148":"Every one, individually or in a group, justifying faith as a conviction operative on the character and will, is distinguished by attributes characterizing him or the group with a particular aim or goal. Or with a Kiblah meeting his or their expectations and may or may not be based on spiritual apprehension of divine truths past or present. This must not be the cause inducing you people to contend against each other. The cause for which you should be ready to contend to your life's end is good will and deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety. One day, wherever you may be, shall Allah bring you all together to His venerable Majestic presence; He is indeed Qadirun over all things","2:149":"And whenever you, Muhammad, depart from a place, turn your face at prayer toward the Sacred Mosque, for it is indeed the truth proceeding from Allah, your Creator, and Allah is not unaware of all that you do","2:150":"Again, whenever you depart from a place, always turn your face at prayer toward the Sacred Mosque and wherever you people may be, inside or outside, turn your faces at prayer to ward it, so that you people do not stand at the mark of criticism by others except by the wrongful. Do not fear them but fear and revere Me so that I may bestow My favour upon you, and you may be guided into all truth","2:151":"Even as We sent to you people a Prophet from among you to recite to you Our revelations, and impart sanctity, teach you the Book and acquaint your hearts with wisdom and with what you did not knew intellectually nor spiritually","2:152":"Therefore, bear Me in mind with reverence so that I bear you in mind and impel yourselves with gratitude.

Allah upholds the patient who endure trouble with calmness and composure, showing forbearance under provocation, bearing with others their faults and limitations and showing constancy in labour and effort","2:154":"Do not consider the martyrs in Allah’s cause to be dead. They carried truth’s banners against odds and have acquired the glorious privilege of martyrdom through resisting shedding blood with spiritual armour. Do not say, \"They are dead\", for they are alive in heaven's realm but your senses do not perceive this fact","2:155":"We will afflict you with some disagreeable events and misfortunes to test your faith’s qualities. We will make you experience fear, hunger and loss of wealth and lives, and a diminished yield in the earth’s fruits.

Therefore, he who goes on AL-Hajj (pilgrimage) to the Sacred Mosque or on the minor Hajj, the ‘Umra, incurs no blame to go round in procession, and he who offers of his own accord to perform this virtuous rite shall find Allah responsive to pious actions. Indeed, Allah acknowledges what is esteemed a worthy deed; He is 'Alimun","2:159":"Indeed, those who conceal the knowledge of the clear signs and revelations guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and from want of spiritual and intellectual vision into mental illumination and enlightenment have come within the measure of Allah's wrath. They have earned the curse of Allah and of the angels and of the pious whose curse damages the accused; their own homes shall be cursed","2:160":"But such misfortune would be cancelled for those who repent, make amends and declare the truth. Such persons shall come in My grace. I will pardon their offence. It is I who accept true repentance and people’s atonement. I am AL- Rahim","2:161":"Those denying Allah, and rejecting the Faith, who died captivated in disbelief, had come within the measure of Allah's wrath.

But if a brother (co-religionist) is in a position to forgive, then forgiveness should go hand in hand with sound Judgement and the demands should be agreeable to reason as judged appropriate to the circumstances.

Yet those who disputed its precepts were the same who were given the Book (Ahl Al-Kitab) imparting enough signs guiding them into illumination and mental enlightenment.

Should the debtor be of unsound mind, weak, or incapable of dictating, then his guardian should dictate according to equity and good conscience. And select two of your men to be formally present as witnesses to the transaction. And if two men are unavailable, then one man and two commendable women so that later, if one errs due to a memory lapse, lack of experience or a biological factor, then the other will remind her of the correct testimony. And those who were called upon to witness the transaction and were associated with the event must not refuse when they are called in for evidence in the future. And do not be disinclined to commit the debt, small or large, to writing. Sanctioned by Allah according to judicial principles, this is recourse to a credited testimony preventing doubt. This is mandatory unless it is business involving bartered merchandise or collective management at an immediate cash rate, then you are absolved if you do not commit it to writing. But when you dispose of merchandise to a buyer for price, then such transactions must be witnessed. And neither writer nor witness should be made to suffer, for if you harm them, you commit a sin that shall be transferred to you, and revere Allah; He teaches you and shows you through information or instruction; He is 'Alimun of all in all","2:283":"And if you are on a journey and cannot find a writer, then place a pledge in the creditor’s possession as a guarantee of good faith. And if the debtor considers the creditor a credible person then the creditor should prove himself trustworthy and return the pledge upon receiving the debt from the debtor, also expected to be trustworthy, and either of them should keep Allah in mind and revere Him. And do not conceal, destroy, suppress or refuse to provide evidence when summoned, and he who withholds testimony is indeed morally depraved with a soiled and sinful heart. And Allah is 'Alimun of all you do","2:284":"To Allah belong all in the heavens and earth and realise that regardless of how you express yourself, in words or secretly in the mind and heart, all comes to Allah’s knowledge, and He shall judge you accordingly. He shall then extend mercy and forgiveness to whom He will and put to torment whom He will, and Allah is Qadirun to effect all things","2:285":"The Prophet strongly believes in all that has been revealed to him from Allah, his Creator. He pays credence to it and embraces it as truth personified. Similarly act the true believers who revere profoundly, they believe in Allah, His spiritual angels or attendants, His books and His Messengers. And they emphatically declare: \"We do not differentiate between one Prophet and another.\" And they beseech Allah for forgiveness with the following prayer of invocation: \"We have, O Allah, heard Your message with receptive hearts and venerated Your revelations and all enjoined, and we obey all Your statutes and ordinances You decreed. O Allah, our Creator, kindly grant Your mercy and forgiveness to us; You are the end of all destiny","2:286":"Allah does not charge a soul except with what it can bear; a soul shall qualify to reap the fruit it merits for its innocence and piety, and it shall pay its own debt and suffer accordingly. Therefore, beseech Him in heaven to take mercy on your souls, praying thus: \"O Allah, our Creator, do not condemn us if we fail to remember, if we err innocently, if our imperfections fall short of the purpose, if we dissatisfy Your standard or neglect a duty. And present us not, O Allah, our Creator, with difficulties as the difficulties you imposed on those who came before us in consequence of their arrogance and wrongful actions.\" \"And charge us not O Allah, our Creator, with the unbearable, pardon us, forgive us and have mercy on us; You are our Protective Guardian; help us gain advantage over those who deny you","3:1":"(Alef), L.

So there came the Quran that is the standard and the canon illuminating the intellect and imparting the soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends and in the choice of what is morally good, honest and straightforward. It guides into illumination and enlightenment. Therefore, those who disregard Allah’s revelations and signs that He makes obvious to the senses, shall suffer grievously. Allah is Azizun (Almighty) He justly avenges His right","3:5":"There is absolutely nothing that can be hidden from Allah, be it on earth or in the heavens","3:6":"He is it who forms you and fashions you inside the womb as He wills and determines the characteristics of your form and appearance. There is no Ilah but Him, AL-Aziz and AL-Hakim (the Wise)","3:7":"It is He who has revealed to you O Muhammad; the Quran with revelations that are precise and exactly defined. These constitute the essential part and the fundamental or groundwork of Allah’s system of faith and worship and unequivocal understanding and obedience from every intellectual being. Other revelations are allegorical. They describe a subject under the guise of some other comparable subject. Those with malignant and perverse hearts choose to follow only the allegories to interpret them as they please. Motivated by malice, they present the interpretation that causes dissension and includes discord when no one knows the exact interpretation but Allah. But those with well – founded knowledge, acquainted with the facts, declare their firm belief in the Quran and express their thoughts in words: \"It is all disclosed by Providence.\" But none reflect except those with sound minds","3:8":"Who express their prayer of invocation: \"O Allah our Creator, we beseech You not to erase piety from our hearts after You have made us true believers and guided us to the path of righteousness. O Allah, extend to us Your mercy; it is You Who gives and it is You Who bestows gratuitously","3:9":"You have ordained, O Allah, our Creator, that You shall assemble all people together to Your August presence on that inevitable Day. Blessed be Allah Who unfailingly fulfils His promise","3:10":"Neither wealth nor progeny shall be of value or advantage in Day of Judgement, to those who deny Allah. Nor shall these privileges protect them from Allah; such persons shall be the fuel feeding the fire","3:11":"What becomes of them compares to what had become of the people of Pharaoh and to those who preceded them who refused to recognize Our revelations and signs, evincing both Omnipotence and Authority. Consequently Allah seized them with a calamity and reduced them to a useless form in requital of their iniquities. With justness does Allah punish severely","3:12":"Say O Muhammad to those infidels who deny Allah: \"You shall be reduced to submission here, and be banished into Hell Hereafter. and how evil is the destined habitation","3:13":"There is an intellectual and spiritual lesson to comprehend. Two forces met, one fighting in favour of Allah and the other against Allah. The pursuit of an end and the unwavering and positive stand merited the Muslims aid at the hands of Allah to the end that the enemy of faith was divinely induced to form witness a mirage of the Muslims portraying them to be twice as the enemy. Allah confirms whom He will and gives them supremacy and superiority and bestows victory. This is indeed an instructive example to those who have opened their minds’ eyes","3:14":"Prompted by instinct and charged to the finger tips with life, people allured by a passion for women, to the accumulation of masses of gold and silver, to owning pedigree horses and an abundance of cattle and fertile land. All in all, these are simply the ephemeral pleasures of life below, whereas in heaven's realm pleasures are eternal and the abode is an atmosphere of rapturous delight","3:15":"Say to them O Muhammad: \"Shall I inform you of what excels that which allures your eyes and minds here? Paradise beneath which rivers flow is unsurpassed in beauty and supreme bliss, destined to those who revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him.

He exercises His authority and power in maintenance and vindication of right by reward or punishment. There is no Ilah but Him, AL-Aziz and AL-Hakim","3:19":"The religion, the system of faith and worship, commended by Allah is Islam or the recognition on the part of man of Allah’s Omnipotence and Authority and His power to control destiny besides acceptance of this feeling as a standard of spiritual and practical life. Yet not until they had received the divine discourse and intellectual acquaintance of the truth did Ahl al-Kitab fall into dispute and become divided through mutual envy and ill intention. He who disregards Allah’s revelations and visible signs shall find that Allah is indeed swift in putting the law in execution","3:20":"Should Ahl al-Kitab argue with you, O Muhammad, and maintain their irreverent position by adducing their unfounded reasons, then say to them: \"I have vowed to resign myself to Allah’s purpose and I have conformed my will and my reason to His blessed will. So have those who fell into line with me.\" Say to them and to the illiterates: \"Are you now satisfied with what you heard and have your doubts been satisfied? If you are, then conform to Islam\". If they do, then they are on the path of righteousness, but should they turn a deaf ear and their hearts cannot hear the truth, you are only responsible for relating the message. Allah keeps a watchful eye upon His creation and upon the way people conduct themselves in life and He knows the attributes inherent in each and all","3:21":"Indeed those who disregard Allah’s revelations and visible signs and in defiance of Allah wrongfully kill His Prophets and those who enjoin righteousness, they shall be miserably disappointed of their expectations. Announce to them, O Muhammad, the coming of a grievous punishment","3:22":"These are they whose deeds and moral actions shall come to be devoid of value here and Hereafter, and no one shall afford them help","3:23":"Have you not seen, O Muhammad, the disposition of those who had their share of the Book and divine knowledge, how evasive they are! When the Quran is chosen as the arbiter in a dispute to settle all matters of difference, some of them pay no attention","3:24":"They imagine falsely and then exclaim: \"Fire will not touch us but for a certain number of days.\" They attribute this forgery to their religion, and consequently deceived their own mind's eyes","3:25":"So how will they react when We assemble them on the inevitable Day when each soul shall be requited with what is commensurate with its deeds and they shall not be wronged","3:26":"Advance the glory of Allah and extol and magnify Him with praise.

She grew to a place of incomparable honour and Zakariya (Zakariah) fostered her. Every time Zakariya entered into her chamber in the Temple, he found her well provisioned. He asked: \"O Maryam, from which source do you get this unprecedented provision?\" \"It is from Allah\", she said, \"Indeed Allah provides livelihood and fits out meritoriously whom He will with what He will and with what he deems necessary for a certain purpose","3:38":"There and then did Zakariya pray and beseech Allah, his Creator; he said: \"O Allah, my Creator, may I make a humble request to You to bestow on me from Your grace a pious posterity, You are AL-Sami’ so You hear the prayer","3:39":"His prayer was met with quite an unexpected and most favourable divine response.

This is the logical sequence which Allah has imparted to them, the divine knowledge which they have imparted to people, the divine knowledge which they themselves have applied their minds to its acquisition","3:80":"Allah does not ordain that you take the angels and the Prophets as tutelary deities. Would he command you to deny Him after you have conformed your will to His blessed will and accepted His divine system of faith and worship","3:81":"Allah entered into a covenant with the Prophets, expressing the obligation to which they are bound. \"I have given you the Book,\" He said, \"and acquainted your hearts with wisdom.

He who refuses to acknowledge this religious rite must realize that Allah is Ghaniyun (independent) of all creation, Self Existent and Absolute","3:98":"Say to Ahl al-Kitab: \"Why do you deny Allah’s revelations and visible signs when Allah is Shahidun ( Omniscient) of all that you do","3:99":"And ask them: \"Why do you stand in the way, preventing Allah’s spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth? Why do you make it your aim to pervert the truth and crook the path of righteousness to your own ends when you bear witness to the fact that this is the path where Providence is the Guide? Allah is not unmindful of all that you do","3:100":"O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand, if you open your hearts' ears to some of Ahl AL-Kitab, they will alienate you from Allah’s purpose. They shall turn you renegades and you shall go over from your religion after you have conformed to Islam","3:101":"How can you consent to the denial of Allah when Allah’s revelations are narrated to you and the truth of the matter is stated to you and Allah’s Messenger is in your midst! He who turns his mind to Allah and chooses to be under His tutelage shall have been guided to the path of righteousness","3:102":"You who believed and gave credence to the Prophet's mission, revere Allah in the manner appropriate to His Absolute Sovereignty. Entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and adhere to Allah’s' system of faith and worship so that when death lays his hands on you and you go through its door, you will have conformed your will to Allah’s blessed will","3:103":"Hold firmly together and grasp the eternal and unchangeable sublime system of Allah! Lay hold of it with the mind and do not be discordant among yourselves. Call to mind Allah’s favour that you wear. You were enemies and He accorded your differences and you cherished different principles and practices and by His grace you are now in one accord. You were on the edge of the bottomless abyss of Hell and He saved you from eternal disaster. Thus, Allah expounds to you His revelations so that you may hopefully be guided to His path of righteousness","3:104":"Let there be unity in feeling and purpose among you. Be united as one whole who would enjoin conformity of life and conduct to the requirements of divine and moral law. Forbid all that is wrongful and obscene. Such people shall reap the fruits of victory here and in the Hereafter","3:105":"Do not be like those who were divided among themselves and discordant after they have received divine revelations and signs guiding them out of darkness and superstition and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment. Such people shall suffer grievously","3:106":"This shall be on the day when countenances speak different languages; some being effulgent with splendour and bright light, beaming with joy and hope while others are dark and gloomy. Rebuked for want of faith, they shall be told: \"How could you deny Allah after you have recognized Him. You have well deserved to be put to the torment in requital of infidelity","3:107":"Whereas those whose countenances are expressive of joy and hope shall be the recipients of Allah’s blessings; they shall be beset with Allah’s infinite mercy","3:108":"These are Allah’s revelations O Muhammad, We narrate them to you in truth, and it has never been Allah’s purpose to exercise injustice to people","3:109":"To Allah belong all that is in the Heavens and all that is on Earth, and to Allah, the Ultimate Authority, are committed and submitted all matters and all affairs for consideration, decision and execution here and in the Hereafter","3:110":"You Muslims have been the best people* that have evolved from mankind for mankind. You enjoin equity and you recourse to general principles of justice. You forbid all that is wrongful and obscene and you conform your will to Allah’s blessed will","3:111":"They will not hurt your interests O Mohammad nor will they harm you. They will only be a source of annoyance. If they war against you they will turn tail and seek safety in flight and will not be crowned with victory","3:112":"They have been stamped with humiliation (The Jews) wherever they are found, except when they come to be under the tutelage of Allah and at peace with people. They came within the measure of Allah’s wrath and they were stamped with mortification of pride. Their unjustifiable slaying of the Prophets was in the train of their defiance of piety. Their disobedience was natural to them that it became an addiction to transgression","3:113":"But in fairness to them, Ahl AL-Kitab are not all alike. Among them are a people who conform their will to Allah’s blessed will; a people who recite verses of Allah’s revelations by night and bow to the ground in reverence and adoration and prostrate their reason to divine revelation","3:114":"They believe in Allah with hearts impressed with images of religious and spiritual virtues and they are mindful of the Hereafter. They enjoin equity and recourse to general principles of justice and they condemn the bad and emulate the best. Such people are enrolled among the righteous","3:115":"Whatever good they do, they shall never be denied the fruit nor the reward of any deed imprinted with wisdom and piety. Allah is fully aware of those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him","3:116":"Indeed those who denied Allah were born to be losers; neither their wealth nor their progeny shall profit them or afford them help nor be beneficially effective against what Allah has for them in store. These are the inmates of hell to endure for that vast forever","3:117":"The example of whatever they spent in this world that was not pertaining to Allah is just like the crops of wrong headed farmers who were wrongful of actions. Their yield was hit by an icy cold wind that reduced it to ruin. It was not Allah Who did them injustice but it was they who wronged themselves","3:118":"O you people whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues: do not have as intimate associates a body of persons of another law; they shall not hesitate to pervert you. They eagerly wish to overthrow you or bring an irretrievable disaster upon you. Nature has written a letter of discredit upon their faces that reflect hatred; such a hatred that is portrayed in their thoughts which they express in words, but worse is what their bosoms conceal. We have made to you Our revelations clear and plain if only you have soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends","3:119":"You see how you hold them dear and entertain great regard for them while they do not reciprocate the same feeling. You give credence to all the Books which Allah has revealed while they do not. When they come face to face with you they declare that they have conformed their will to Allah’s blessed will but when they are apart from you, they bite their lips and their finger tips in the rage of distemper. Say to them O Muhammad: \"Perish those whose minds are backwards and perish you in the rage of your distemper; Allah is indeed 'Alimun of all private thoughts and feelings in the breast","3:120":"If good fortune falls to you, be it through victory or through martyrdom, they come to be actuated by envy and grieved at heart. If you are befallen with a disaster or wedded to a calamity, they rejoice beyond a common joy. If you be patient and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, you shall not be hurt by their wicked plots and intrigues. Allah besets them on all sides and He is 'Alimun of all that they do","3:121":"Remember O Muhammad that once when you left your household early in the morning resolving to take your station for battle and to command your faithful followers to take post and Allah is Sami’un, and 'Alimun","3:122":"Then two of your tribes almost lost heart. However, they were saved by the graceful tutelage of Allah, and in Allah should those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand put their trust","3:123":"The Battle of Badr ought to have taught you abhorrence of want of faith and lack of discipline. Allah has made victory sit on your helm even though you were an insignificant humble force out of heart. Therefore, revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him so that you may hopefully impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude","3:124":"You Muhammad told your faithful troops, who were confronted with an unexpected situation and thought they were affronting death, to lift up their hearts and their morale. You said to them: \"Is it not enough for you that Allah, your Creator, upholds you with an array of three thousand angels specially dispatched from heaven's realm to support your cause","3:125":"Indeed if you exercise patience and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah you shall be able to do battle against your enemy. Should you be taken by surprise and be suddenly attacked you shall receive Allah’s aid; He shall uphold you with an array of five thousand angels emblematic of onslaught","3:126":"Such an announcement of Allah’s aid was meant to be cheerful news to raise your spirits and to ease your anguish of a torturing hour and make you rest assured of victory. It should have made you realize that victory and the position of supremacy and superiority are an attribute and an act of Allah, AL- Aziz and AL-Hakim","3:127":"Allah ordained this course of events. He purposed to strike a part of the evil group of infidels at the root and so with one single blow would they be severed, or to disgrace them and enrage their blood and put them into such a commotion that would precipitate their humiliation and defeat","3:128":"It is none of your concern nor is it the concern of your people O Muhammad whether Allah reduces your enemy's number and their land or the extent of their power and wealth or whether He effects their defeat or relents and pardons their offence or requites them with retributive punishment. They are a wrongful people","3:129":"To Allah belong all that is in the Heavens and all that is on Earth. He forgives whom He will and punishes whom He will. Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun","3:130":"O you who have conformed to Islam! Usury is incompatible with religion. Do not swallow voraciously whatever interest you can get for the money you lend, doubling and redoubling the interest as you go. Revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him so that heaven may prosper you","3:131":"And save yourselves the Fire especially prepared for those who disobey Allah’s commands","3:132":"Obey Allah and His Messenger so that you may come to be recipients of His mercy","3:133":"Enter into rivalry with each other for forgiveness from Allah, your Creator, and for a hearty welcome in a Paradise as extensive as are the Heavens and the Earth, specially prepared for those who revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him","3:134":"It is a paradise of supreme bliss prepared specially for those who spend in divine service in instances of prosperity and in instances of adversity, who restrain and suppress their feeling of anger and accord people forgiveness and do not entertain them with thoughts of ill will. Allah likes those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence","3:135":"Those who no sooner do they commit an immoral act, than they at once recall Allah to mind and invoke His forgiveness. Who can forgive transgression of the divine law and the offence against Allah but Him? They do not insist on their course of action when they know it is wrong","3:136":"Such persons shall merit forgiveness from Allah, their Creator, and the life in supreme bliss in gardens beneath which rivers flow after they will have passed through nature to Eternity. How excellent is the reward of those who strive for a good end","3:137":"A narration of events, modes of action and examples from ages past serve as evidence for each instance forming a particular case of principle and a signal instance of punishment. Therefore, journey the land you Muslims and pause to think and meditate what you see with your minds’ eyes in order to realize the fatal consequence which united all those who persisted in their intentional assertion of falsehood","3:138":"This is a proclamation for mankind that is documented in the Quran in which Providence is the guide, and an admonition to those who revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful To Him","3:139":"Do not falter in your war of belief against positive unbelief nor grieve at heart, for you shall gain the upper hand if your hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues","3:140":"If you have sustained a heavy blow with injuries, so have the enemies. We rotate fortune and alternate the days of gratification and the days of distress. So that each people have their day and Allah distinguishes the steadfast among the believers who are immovable in faith and confers the prerogative of martyrdom on those of you who qualify; Allah detests the wrongful","3:141":"And Allah fits those whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues so purified to rid them of doubt and of those who are hypocrites and to massacre the infidels who deny Him","3:142":"Did you think that you would be heartily welcomed in the realm of surpassing beauty and supreme bliss before Allah has seen that you have distinguished yourselves on every front or line of battle and that you have been distinguished into the valiant and those who are unwearied in the face of difficulties","3:143":"Before the encounter with death, you had always wished yourselves dead in the cause of Allah, and now that you have seen it executed in your companions, you falter and let go; you quit your posts and seek much after booty","3:144":"Muhammad is but a Messenger the like of whom have passed away before him. Do you mean if he dies or is slain in battle, you turn renegades and return to idolatry! Indeed he who turns back on his heels and reverses his position shall never hurt Allah’s interest in the least, and Allah shall reward the thankful","3:145":"Nor can a soul be disembodied except by Allah’s permission according to a predetermined point of time that had been entered in a Book. He who so sets his mind upon the mundane things ministering to his enjoyment and content here below shall be requited with what is apportioned to him in this world. He who so sets his mind upon the divine things conducing to Allah’s mercy and grace Hereafter shall be requited with what is commensurate with his deeds of wisdom and piety. We will generously reward those who impel themselves to the feeling of gratitude","3:146":"A good many of the Prophets fought against positive disbelief and with them fought countless numbers of devotees whose hearts had been touched with the divine hand. Never did they falter in consequence of the misfortunes they experienced in the cause of Allah, nor were they disheartened or dispirited, nor did they acknowledge themselves beaten. Allah likes the patient who are unwearied in the face of difficulties","3:147":"All they said was no other than their prayer of invocation: \"O Allah, our Creator, forgive us our iniquities and the excesses into which we might have been driven and help us take a firm position and set our feet firm, and make victory and fortune sit on our helm so that we reduce those who deny you to ruin","3:148":"In return did Allah requite them with what they merited for their deeds of wisdom and piety here below and the surpassing merit Hereafter. Allah likes those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence","3:149":"O you who have conformed to Islam do not falter by consequence of misfortunes in battle nor lend an ear to the infidels who deny Allah. For if you open your hearts, ears to them, they shall be able to turn you renegades and you will relapse into infidelity and come to be great losers","3:150":"Do not forget that Allah is your Tutelary Guardian and who can gain advantage on Allah","3:151":"We will inspire terror in the infidels' hearts and dishearten them for incorporating with Allah other deities He never authorized. Their destined abode is Hell and evil indeed is the destined habitation of the wrongful","3:152":"Allah has kept His promise to you as was shown in putting your enemy to rout, Allah permitting, until you began to falter by reason of opposing arguments. Some were in favour of obeying the Prophet's command and maintaining their posts and the others against his command, running after booty, at a time when the Prophet was about to make the victory. Among you are those who are concerned only with the interests and pleasures of life below and its mundane things, and others whose main concern is Allah’s grace Hereafter. Then did Allah distract your minds and your attention and made you draw off from the battle field to test your true inclination and He afforded you forgiveness. Allah’s bounty abounds in those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues","3:153":"You forced your way up the hill paying attention to no one while the Prophet in the rear convoked you to come to fight. There, did Allah requite you with grief, upon grief, for being balked of your booty and for fleeing in the face of danger, so that you would learn not to grieve for what you miss nor to despair for what befalls you. Allah is 'Alimun of all that you do","3:154":"Thereafter did Allah replace the emotion of sorrow and grief by peace of mind and sense of security, which induced the eyes of some of you to take themselves to slumber. Others were aroused to emotion, which begot unjust suspicion of Allah, and a state of mind characteristic of ignorance - analogous to the ignorance induced by paganism. The latter keep their thoughts to themselves and do not express them to you O Muhammad and they say to themselves: \"If we had a say in the matter we would never have been slain here in battle!\" Say to them: \"Had you decided to be the stay- at- home, those of you predestined to be slain would have emerged to the sites of their interment.\" Such a train of events, Allah has ordained to expose your actions interpreting your thoughts, and to test your innermost being for such a disposition as your hearts and minds would incline you to propound. Allah is 'Alimun of all that is stored in the bosoms","3:155":"Those of you who turned tail and abandoned their posts on the day the two forces met were but victims of AL-Shaytan. Who took advantage of their disobedience to the Prophet and led them to their fall from their first perfection. However Allah has afforded them forgiveness. He is Ghafurun (Indulgent), and Halimun (Forbearing)","3:156":"O you who conformed to Islam, be not like those infidels who denied Allah and thought they could prevent what is fated to happen. On every occasion when they lost some of their fellow countrymen in journeys of trade or in wars, they expressed their thoughts in words: \"Had they been with us and remained here, they would not have died nor been slain.\" This feeling and thought did Allah infuse into them to actuate their hearts and minds with grief. It is Allah who gives life and occasions the moment of death and He is 'Alimun of all that you do","3:157":"If you are slain in the course of a hostile encounter between belief and positive unbelief or you die in battle or from another cause, you will have merited Allah’s forgiveness and mercy. This outweighs all that you might have earned or accumulated had you been carried through the stealing steps of age into advanced life. Therefore, give up resentment against them and invoke on their behalf Allah’s mercy","3:158":"Whether you die or be slain, shall all of you be gathered to Allah","3:159":"Allah of His mercy made your heart, O Muhammad, ever tender in the treatment of the calamity which they -your people- brought upon themselves in battle. He made you speak to them in the gentle voice of peace. Had you been unsparing in censure and reproof and harsh hearted, they would have broken the bonds of loyalty and would have broken away from you. Therefore, give up resentment against them and invoke on their behalf Allah’s mercy and consult with them upon matters of great moment, matters on which you received no divine authoritative instructions. So when you have caused a discord to pass into a concord and resolved on a course of action, then in Allah you trust, for Allah likes those who put their trust in Him","3:160":"If Allah upholds you and confers on you His tutelary protection, no one can gain advantage over you, and if He should deny you tutelary protection, who else is there besides Him who can protect you or help you in distress and misfortune! In Allah should those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand put their trust","3:161":"It is not a Prophet who would appropriate spoils or anything else to wrong uses or apply it dishonestly to his own use. Nor would he ever betray the trust or the one who trusted him. He who withholds from anyone what is his, by right, shall carry in Day of Judgement the insignia of fraud and misappropriation when every soul shall be requited with what is commensurate with its deeds and no one shall be wronged","3:162":"Shall he who obeyed Allah’s statutes in quest of Allah’s satisfaction compare with the one who came within the measure of Allah’s wrath and has been destined to the abode in Hell, which is an evil destiny","3:163":"People are divided according to grades of quality, disposition and attributes as determined by Allah. Allah is Bassirun, He sees all that they do","3:164":"Allah has been gracious to those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand. He raised in their midst a Messenger who is related to them by kinship and by spiritual qualities into which they all entered. He is a Messenger who shall recite to them His revelations, impart sanctity to them and teach them the Book -the Quran- and acquaint their hearts with wisdom, notwithstanding that they were once lost in the maze of error and liberally swam in immoral pleasure","3:165":"Now that you have been wedded to a calamity which you brought upon yourselves by consequence of disobedience when the two forces met, a calamity which does not compare with that you brought on your enemy that was twice as severe; now you ask: \"How did it happen and what was it due to?\" Say to them O Muhammad \"You brought it on yourselves as a logical conclusion for your wrongful action. Allah is indeed Qadirun over all things","3:166":"What befell you that day when the two forces met was justly brought about by Allah’s permission to distinguish those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues","3:167":"He exposes the hypocrites who pretended to be other then they are. When they were asked to join the Muslim forces to fight in the cause of Allah or at least to defend their own interests; they made excuses. They said, \"We would gladly follow you if we knew how to fight.\" They were then furthermost from Allah and their words did not accord to their inmost thoughts. Allah knows best their secret feelings","3:168":"It was those who stayed at home who had something to say in defense and extenuation of their conduct. They made unfavourable comments on their fellow Muslims who were slain in battle; They said; \"Had they obeyed us and remained here, they would not have been slain.\" Say to them O Muhammad. \"If this be the case, then avert death and prevent it from befalling you if indeed you are declaring the truth","3:169":"Do not consider them dead the martyrs in the cause of Allah for they are living in heaven's realm in the venerable and. revered August presence of Allah, their Creator, laying in divine provisions","3:170":"Rejoicing beyond a common joy at Allah’s bounty abounding in them and joyful for those who are yet to join them for they shall have no grounds for alarm nor shall fear or dread fall upon them nor shall they come to grief","3:171":"They have assumed a state of mind that brightens up their faces for the grace and the bounty conferred on them by Allah. It is a state of mind with an air of assurance that Allah does not withhold nor withdraw the grateful return due to those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues","3:172":"Who responded favourably to Allah and to His Prophet and resumed fighting after they had stopped having been wedded to the calamity. It was those who excelled at the battle and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; they shall be requited with what is generously commensurate with their deeds","3:173":"The news simply strengthened them mentally and morally and confirmed their faith, when they were told by the people that their enemies had mustered up a great number of troops to fight against them so, they should be fearful of them. It was those who did not fear fate; they feared naught but Allah, and said; \"Allah is the answer to our purpose, our hopes and our needs, and how excellent He is for the Tutelary Guardian","3:174":"Never was battle executed with greater determination, that the enemy had sensed and consequently fled from the rage of those whom they considered persecutors. There and then did the Muslims return, by the grace of Allah and His bounty, unharmed and not even touched physically in any way. They espoused the cause of Allah and His satisfaction and were consequently qualified to receive His blessings, and Allah’s bounty is plentiful, full flowing","3:175":"It was only AL-Shaytan hiding behind those with characteristics befitting him, who inspired terror in the hearts and minds of those who were submissive to them, who in turn tried to transmit it to some of you! Therefore, do not be fearful of them but fear Me if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues","3:176":"Let not those who impel themselves heedlessly on infidelity grieve you O Muhammad. They shall not harm Allah in the least. Allah has intended to allot to them no share of the bliss Hereafter, and there awaits them a condign punishment","3:177":"Those who exchanged faith for infidelity shall never harm Allah in the least and their awaits them the torment which shall be laid on the damned","3:178":"The infidels must not think that the respite We grant them is for their own good; We simply give them plenty of rope to allow them free action in order that they commit themselves further to the evil line of conduct. There awaits them a condign and humiliating punishment","3:179":"It was never in the set of Allah’s correlated principles to let those who conformed to Islam remain in this present state which is a combination of circumstances and attributes, but only to segregate the bad from the good, expose the malevolent and distinguish the benevolent. Nor did Allah intend to endow you people with the prerogative of divination nor with power of knowing the unknown or realizing the unseen or the invisible. Yet He chooses from His Prophets whom He will and gives them knowledge of events to come according to His will. Therefore, believe you people in Allah and give credence to His Prophets, for if you believe with hearts that reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, you shall be requited with a great reward","3:180":"Nor should those who are unwilling to spend in divine service of what Allah conferred on them consider this tight fisted disposition an advantage to them. To the contrary, it is an injury to their interest and prejudice to their credit. They shall be fitted round their necks in Day of Judgement with the insignia of what they hoarded. To Allah shall be the inheritance of the realms of the Heavens and the Earth, and Allah is 'Alimun of all that you do","3:181":"Allah has heard the discourse of those of Ahl AL-Kitab who expressed their thoughts in words, saying: \"Allah is poor whereas we are rich.\" We will record their dissertation as well as their unjustified slaying of the prophets, and shall say to them at the predetermined moment: \"Now taste the torment of burning in the Fire","3:182":"This is the train of evil that your wrongful and unclean hands have drawn after them.\" Allah is not unjust to His servants","3:183":"Who said: \"Allah has enjoined us not to give credence to a Prophet until he has presented to us an offering which of necessity be devoured by a fire from heaven.\" Say to them O Muhammad: \"Many Prophets before me had presented you with clear evidence of Allah’s Omnipotence and of their delegated divine authority and with such divinely miraculous acts as you have described, why then did you bring death upon them if indeed you are declaring the truth","3:184":"Should they disbelieve you and think you convey a false message; they had already refused credence to Messengers sent before you; who were sent to them with clear and plain revelations and signs, Scriptures and Psalms guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment","3:185":"Every soul is destined to the encounter with death and in Day of Judgement shall you be requited only with what is due to you. He who is diverted from the path leading to Hell to the path bounding for Paradise will have triumphed. Life here below is but an animate existence affording pleasure, deceiving those with foolishly credulous ambition and vain employment of time","3:186":"You people shall be afflicted with some disagreeable events and misfortunes to test your qualities. You shall experience loss in wealth and in lives and you shall hear injuriously contemptuous insults from those who received the Book before you as well as from those who incorporate with Allah other deities. If you are patient and forbearing and you entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, you will have then considered matters with an attitude of mind reflecting high spirit and strong will","3:187":"For once did Allah make a covenant with Ahl AL-Kitab. They should make the Book genuinely known to everyone and not hide the least part of its text and its precepts.

Thus, you profanely relieve from service, designate by a descriptive name and dedicate to idols","5:104":"When told to recourse to what Allah has sent down of divine revelations, and to the Messenger for help and advice, they simply refuse. They say: \"We are quite satisfied with the particular system of faith and worship our fathers were bent on. But how will it be if their fathers had lacked the soundness of judgement and had missed the path of righteousness","5:105":"Begin with yourselves and invest your own souls with such religious and spiritual virtues as Allah has inclined you to propound and guard yourselves from being supposed, then no one who deviates in mind can possibly pervert you nor alienate you from Allah’s purpose, provided you lift to Him your inward sight and maintain His path of righteousness where Providence is the guide. You are all destined to go back to Allah Who shall inform you of all that your minds and your souls had impelled you to do","5:106":"O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: when any of you feels death impending and he wishes to make a bequest, then witness action is mandatory. Two of your just men known to recourse to justice are summoned to witness the action. And in the event of being on a journey when the calamity of death befalls you, then two other men are duly detained following the funerary prayer to establish the point in question. And if you should apprehend guilt or fault on their part, then they are asked to perform the act of worship and then be sworn, thus: \"We swear by Allah that we have no selfish motive principles nor do we favour anyone for a gain, even if he be within the first degree of consanguinity, nor will we hide or suppress testimony a divine duty, and be wrongful of actions","5:107":"However, if it is found out, that they have willfully uttered false evidence while on oath, they are replaced by others who claim lawful right to the deceased estate. They are sworn that their evidence is more consistent with fact than that given by the other two men, \"whom\", they say, \"we do not falsely accuse of perjury nor do we give false evidence lest we would be wrongful of actions","5:108":"This prudent course of action is less likely to make the witnesses depart from moral righteousness; it will induce them to honesty lest their testimony be rejected and be replaced by others. Therefore, keep you people Allah in mind and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him; Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness those who are given to evil","5:109":"One day shall Allah gather the Messengers and ask them, thus: \"What response did you get from the people to whom you were sent and how did it accord with their deeds!\" And they shall say: \"Glory be to You, but You are the Omniscient of all the unknown and of all the invisible and of all private thoughts and feelings","5:110":"Then shall Allah address ‘Isa, the son of Maryam, thus: \"Do you remember O ‘Isa My divine favour and the efficacious grace I conferred on you and on your mother; how I supported you and gave you countenance by the Holy Spirit Jibril that you spoke to people while in the cradle and in manhood. And I taught you the Book and wisdom, AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil and made you present your people with an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace featured in the power I imparted to you to create from clay the figure of a bird and inspirit it and it came to be a living bird by My command and made you restore the sight of the congenitally blind and heal the leper by My command, and with My delegated authority raise the dead by My command. And do you remember how I held back Bani Isra‘il from their intended hostile course of action against you when you presented them with divine clear and plain revelations and signs guiding out of darkness and superstitions of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into intellectual illumination and enlightenment, but the infidels among them said: This is nothing but sheer sorcery assumed by him","5:111":"And do you remember how I inspired thought and feelings into the disciples and actuated them with the feeling of conforming their will to My will and of acknowledging your Prophethood and how they responded favourably and said: We do conform our will to Allah’s will and said to you: bear witness O ‘Isa that we are now Muslims and we conform to Allah’s system of faith and worship","5:112":"Then they said to you: \"O ‘Isa, the son of Maryam can Allah your Creator, send down from heaven a table\" And you said to them: \"Revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues","5:113":"And they said to you: \"We wish to sit at it and eat of the food served to satisfy our reason and rest assured that you have brought us the truth and be witnesses thereof","5:114":"There and then you made your invocatory prayer, thus \"O Allah, our Creator, I pray and beseech you to send down to us from your heaven’s realm a table set with food to serve as an occasion to yield our souls to festive mirth and to regale the first and the last of us who conform their will to Your will and as a graceful sign convincing people of Your Omnipotence and Authority. O Allah, our Creator, and provision us from your bounty with the means of sustaining life; You are the best purveyor to fit every person with what is necessary and with what he needs","5:115":"Allah said: \"I will send it down to you, but then he whose heart, thereafter, dare rise defiant against Allah and denies the truth, will I send to his account with all his sins and imperfections on his head to suffer the endless agony which doubles his torment and his woe to an extent which no one else in the universe will suffer","5:116":"Then Allah says to ‘Isa: \"Did you O ‘Isa, the son of Maryam, ask the people to take you and your mother as two Ilah’s besides Allah and pay you the same tribute that is dutiful only to Allah!\" \"Glory be to You\", says ‘Isa, and extolled are Your glorious attributes how could I have said what was never within my right and infinitely beyond my jurisdiction!\" \"If I had uttered it or even thought of it, You would have known it, You can read my thoughts whereas I cannot possibly read Yours; You are 'Alimun of the unknown and of the invisible and of all private thoughts and feelings","5:117":"I never said to them, says ‘Isa, but what You had commanded me to say, thus: \"Worship Allah, my Creator and your Creator\". \"And I observed their deeds and bore witness to their behaviour as long as I lived among them, and when you ordained that I depart life, You were the only one Who constantly kept a vigilant eye upon them and their deeds and toward themselves and toward others and witnessed their course of action You are Shahidun (witness) of all things in all respects","5:118":"If you punish them and cause them to suffer for their offences, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them You are indeed, AL-Aziz and AL-Hakim (Wise)","5:119":"There and then says Allah \"This is the Day when truth shall advantage the virtuous, and truthfulness is their attribute.

Yet the infidels equalize Him with creatures of their fancy and incorporate them with Him as a corporate deity","6:2":"You people had better realize, that it was He who brought you into being and effected your special creation from clay, then ordained He your span and the span of the universe and kept to Himself the knowledge of the point of time when all shall come to an end, and the Hereafter, begins, Yet you see O Muhammad how they contend with opposing arguments about Resurrection","6:3":"And He is Allah in the heavens and on earth, Who alone has the rightful claim to reverence and veneration featured in the act of worship and in displaying the appropriate acts and rites. He is 'Alimun (Omniscient) of all that you converse secretly or whisper under your breath and of what you suggest, secretly to the mind, of all that your breasts store of thoughts and feelings and of all that you utter. Furthermore, He is 'Alimun of all that you earn of qualities, actions and deeds","6:4":"Yet no revelation, sign or event betokening Allah's Omnipotence and authority and evinces both His Oneness and exclusive power to control fate and destiny, but they refuse to pay heed to it and they turn a deaf ear","6:5":"They rejected the truth and counselled deaf to the Quran when it was presented to them to guide them into all truth. But soon shall they realize the truth of all that has been discoursed in this Quran which they hold up to ridicule","6:6":"Did they not perceive by sight, apprehend by thought and learn by reading how many generations have We destroyed! generations who came to this world before them, endowed with power and ability, diligence and' capacities of action, wealth and knowledge, mental receiving power and talent and with many qualities which total up to a much higher degree than those summed up in you people. We poured down upon them rain and blessings bringing them into a people of condition and We made the rivers run beneath their settled habitations. But in consequence of their ingratitude and inordinate self -esteem, We destroyed them in requital of their transgression of the divine law, their offences against Allah and their violation of the religious and moral principles. We replaced them by other people who listened to reason and whose prudence got the better of their pride","6:7":"And if We sent down to you O Muhammad a written discourse in sheets of paper fastened together, forming a material whole and they perceived it by sight and felt it by touch; thus still the infidels would have labelled it Sheer magic","6:8":"They insolently say: If only an angel had been sent down to companion him - Muhammad- to confer on him dignity in an order of Prophethood! But if We had sent down an angel, then their Hereafter would have been planted in the now and their punishment would not have been put in respite","6:9":"And if We had sent an angel as a Messenger or to companion Our human Messenger, We would have disguised him as a man, and there one disorder would be aggravated by another; they would not believe in him either, and a fallacious mode of reasoning would be created more than ever; they would not know whether to use the premise to prove the conclusion or to use the conclusion to prove the premise - a vicious circle","6:10":"None the less, Messengers who were sent before you O Muhammad were also bombarded with foul epithets. The infidels mocked them and gave them a lick with the rough side of their tongues and called them everything they could lay their tongues to. In consequence were the mockers beset on all sides by the same material and immaterial things they turned into ridicule","6:11":"Say to them: \"Journey the land and open your mind’s eyes to see for yourselves the fatal consequence which united all those who persisted in their intentional assertion of falsehood","6:12":"Ask them: \"To whom do you think the universe belongs!\" and say to them: \"Rest assured that all things including the earth and the Heavens and all that is in them, constituting a systematic whole, belong to Allah alone, Who ascribed mercy unto Himself to give people a chance to repent before the undoubted Day of Resurrection when He shall gather you all to His August Presence.

Never shall the wrongful of actions find one instance of physical or spiritual prosperity Hereafter","6:22":"The Day shall come when We throng them all together and say to them: \"Where are your deities which you presumed to have divine nature that you incorporated them with Allah","6:23":"Not knowing what to do nor which way to turn they shall say: \"By Allah, our Creator, never did we incorporate with Allah other deities","6:24":"See how they will lie in their teeth and tell lies about themselves and be forsaken and renounced by those whom they presumed to share with Allah His divine nature and how they shall fail their expectations","6:25":"And among them are some who listen to your discourse on practical divinity and to the Quran when you recite it, not to profit by it but to pick holes in it and be able to tell their evil minds. The fact is that We have closed their hearts’ ears and deafened their ears to reason. They just would not apprehend with their senses any revelation or any sign no matter how convincing to the mind they be. And when they come to you O Muhammad they do not humble themselves but in arrogance they are more ready to argue than to obey. Vested with infidelity, they interpret their thoughts in words: \"This is nothing\", they say, \"but fables of old","6:26":"And they incite people to reject the Quran and decline to accept it, and they themselves have nothing to do with it. They only bring irretrievable disaster upon themselves and they do not have the wisdom to perceive this fact","6:27":"If only you could visualize their change of mind when they are confined into the slavish imprisonment of Hell! They shall wish they could be sent back to life below and they would never deny Allah's revelations and signs, and they would be among those who conform to Allah's will","6:28":"The fact is that now they do realize their earlier sinful settled behaviour, representing their hidden common feeling of the denial of the truth. And if they were sent back to life below, they would, thus still, resume the same evil practice they were advised to avoid; they are indeed liars","6:29":"They fail to recall to mind what they perpetuated of thoughts which they expressed in words, thus: \"There is only this present life\" they say, \"and it, is only time that shall do away with it, and never shall we be resurrected","6:30":"And if you could visualize them when they are in the August presence in audience of Allah, their Creator, and He asks them: \"Is this not the graphic description of the truth which was related to you by our Messenger you simply denied! \"By Allah, our Creator, it is\", they say, there and then they shall be told: \"Taste the torment laid upon the damned for your intentional denial of the truth","6:31":"Losers indeed are those who deny Resurrection and their audience of Allah, their Creator. And when all of a sudden the predetermined Eventful Hour surprises them, they shall say with pining regrets and vain repentances: \"It is a great pity to have neglected our duty to Allah in life below and for what we left undone.\" They shall be burdened with wrongs more then their backs can bear. Evil indeed is the fate of those who are burdened with wrongs, and evil indeed are the wrongs they wear","6:32":"Indeed life here is but an illusive and rapid change of feeling, fancy and thought and an amusement bringing happiness to those who cannot think, whereas, the abode in heaven's realm Hereafter is far better and indeed blissful but for those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; can you people not reflect","6:33":"We do know O Muhammad that what their dishonesty admits of irreverent discourse grieves you at heart, In fact it is not you that they charge with falsehood, but it is Allah's revelations, signs and Authority that the wrongful deny. They befool their minds and their judgement of the truth to cause what is false be accepted as true","6:34":"Messengers before you O Muhammad had been charged with falsehood just the same and they put up with the charge and bore criticism and wrongful treatment with forbearance, and they bore with their opponents their faults and limitations until Allah ordained to be their very present help ; decisions pronounced by Allah are decisive, irrevocable and conclusive.

Therefore, do not be one of those destitute of Allah's knowledge","6:36":"It is only those who bow down their ears and open their heats’ ears that favourably respond to heaven's call and to spiritual prompting, whereas those destitute of spiritual life are as good as dead to admonition and the dead shall only hear when Allah resurrects them, be it in this world or in the world to come when back to Him they return","6:37":"And the infidels say: \"If only a convincing divine sign be bestowed on him, a sign we perceive mentally or by sight!

There and then We suddenly seized them and dressed them with ruin and there, they simply gave up hope and nursed despair","6:45":"There, were struck at the root and uprooted from the earth the people who were wrongful of actions. An inducement to people of piety to turn to Allah, Creator of the worlds, with praise and best thanks for purging the world of its corrupt members","6:46":"Ask them O Muhammad: \"What if Allah denies you your faculty of hearing and that of sight, faculties divine, and closes your hearts' ears! Who is that deity who is able to restore them to you!\" See Muhammad how We expound and orient Our revelations to circumstances and requirements yet they counsel deaf and refuse to heed","6:47":"Ask them: \"What if Allah 's punishment surprises you or casts its shadow before it strikes you to your marrow! Who but the wrongful of actions shall perish","6:48":"We only send the Messengers in the capacity of spectacles and warnings, and those who recognize their missions and acknowledge Allah's Authority with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety will have won Allah's mercy; no fear or dread shall fall upon them nor shall they come to grief","6:49":"But those who refuse to recognize Our revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority and rejecting the truth of Our Messengers’ missions shall suffer the torment laid on the damned who grew daily more and more wicked","6:50":"Say to your people O Muhammad: \"I do not claim to be in possession of the treasuries of Allah nor do I indulge in prophecy or claim to foretell future events nor do I say I am an angel. I only follow what is inspired to me of truth to guide all people into all truth\". And ask them: \"Shall they be esteemed alike, those who are lacking in intellectual, moral and spiritual perception, and those who perceive mentally and apprehend the truth by thought!

You are not accountable O Muhammad to Allah for their deeds or actions, nor are they accountable to Allah for your deeds or actions to induce you to dismiss them and be wrongful of action","6:53":"Thus did We take matters of fact as they were and circumstanced them after Our own manner. We gathered the rich and the poor together to try them and expose the inclination of the one in the presence of the other.

Nor shall humble intercession be accepted from any on behalf of another, nor shall the equivalent in ransom pay for the expiation of the guilt of the one or the other. These persons of common attributes, qualities and actions shall be requited with what is commensurate with their deeds.

He is indeed your avowed enemy","6:143":"Another strained point upon which the whole unreasoning turns is their superstitious belief of dedicating what they consider sacred to their males denying and condemning their females. Thus they dedicate what sheep and goats, camels and oxen carry in their wombs to their males and exclude their females; a concept bringing Us to eight copulatory mates. Four of them are a pair of sheep and a pair of goats. Ask them O Muhammad: \"Is it the two males or the two females that Allah has forbidden or is it what both females carry in their wombs! \"Tell me who gave you this authority that you speak like a book if indeed you are declaring the truth","6:144":"And to keep to the point-, there follow the pair of camels and those of oxen.

But they were wrongful of actions; and there, you can see what was the end of those who were characterized with prepensed malice","7:104":"Mussa said to Pharaoh: \"I am, O Pharaoh, a Messenger carrying a divine message from Allah, Creator of the universe","7:105":"With great care and solemnity do I relate to Allah nothing but the truth. \"l do hereby present you people with a sign from Allah, your Creator, evincing both the truth of my mission and Allah's supremacy, and by virtue of this sign and of Allah's delegated authority I demand the release of Bani Israel from bondage and they be permitted to go with me to where they are free to practice Allah's system of faith and worship","7:106":"Pharaoh said: \"If indeed you have a divine sign in your sleeve, then present it to view if you are telling the truth","7:107":"Mussa cast his staff on the ground, and instantaneously it was transformed into a serpent personified","7:108":"And he drew his hand from the folds of his garment and there it was instantaneously transfigured in a radiance of white divine light","7:109":"But then, said those among his people in whose hearts reigned vice and falsehood: \"this man is indeed a necromancer skilled in magic, and the works of the Devil are being made manifest in him","7:110":"He means\", they added, to oust you people of your land and drive you away. \"Therefore what course of action do you suggest we should take in the face of this problem","7:111":"They suggested to Pharaoh they should adapt themselves and conform to the time and circumstances so as to gain time and added: \"The time to degrade and defeat him and his brother has not come yet\". \"Meanwhile, send, O Pharaoh, some of your recruits to the cities to gather to themselves the multitude of men who practice magic","7:112":"And they bring back those among them who are skilled in the art of necromancy","7:113":"The experts and skilful in the art of necromancy came to Pharaoh and asked him. \"Shall we be rewarded if we happen to prevail and gain superiority over them","7:114":"Indeed\", said Pharaoh, \"and you shall be in a position that entitles you to be among my retinue","7:115":"They said to Mussa: \" Would you like to cast your artifice upon the ground first to present to view what you have up your sleeve, or shall we cast ours first","7:116":"You cast yours first\", said Mussa, and when they did, they fascinated and bewitched the viewers eyes to the extent that they actuated them with the feeling of terror when they manifested forth their glorious performance","7:117":"There and then did We inspire Mussa to cast his staff upon the ground and there, it counter-worked their ingenious expedient and swallowed all that they cast upon the ground of fraudulent devices of a mean and deceptive kind","7:118":"And there, did heaven, earth and men evidence the truth which was justified by facts and results, just as they evidenced falsehood which was condemned by the annulment of all their various objects of fiction and delight","7:119":"There, before the multitudes and right before Pharaoh's eyes a damned defeat was made; those who had the expertise were reduced to impotence and were humiliated by defeat","7:120":"Overwhelmed with wonder, the sorcerers bowed to the ground in comely order, praise and admiration","7:121":"They declared, thus: \"We do yield to the claims of Mussa and we surrender ourselves to Allah, the Creator of the universe","7:122":"The Ilah of Mussa and Harun","7:123":"There, Pharaoh said to them: \"Have you yielded to his claims and surrendered yourselves to his Allah without my permission!\" Indeed\", he added, \"This is a skilful deceit designed to outwit the inhabitants of the city to drive them out from hence, and in consequence you shall come to know how heavily you shall pay for this","7:124":"I will amputate your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will have you all crucified","7:125":"Gladly\", they said to Pharaoh, \"We welcome your decision which shall haste us unto Allah Who confers on us the glorious privilege of martyrs","7:126":"And they added: \"Do you take vengeance on us just because we have acknowledged the signs of Allah when they were presented to us indicating clearly Allah's Omnipotence and Supremacy and because we asserted to the spirit of truth guiding into all truth!\". And they prayed: O Allah, our Creator, inspire patience and just confidence to us and occasion our death as men who have conformed to Islam","7:127":"There and then said those of Pharaoh's people in whose hearts reigned vice, malice and falsehood: \"O Pharaoh, would you set Mussa and his people free so as to create discord in the land and play the mischief with your subjects and renounce you and your gods, disclaiming obedience to your statutes!\". \" But, Pharaoh said: We will kill their sons, and to serve our purpose, spare their women, and we will gain mastery over them and be their supreme controlling power","7:128":"Implore Allah's aid\", said Mussa to his people, \"and have recourse to prayer, for more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of, and resort to patience to possess your souls\". \"The earth\", he added, \" belongs to Allah. He apportions it as a heritage to whom He will of His servants, and the happy outcome falls to those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him","7:129":"But in despair did his people say to him: \" We have been burdened with cruel impositions before you came to us and since you have been with us\". \" May Allah, your Creator, said Mussa , reduce your enemy into a useless form and designate you the successors in the land, and then He shall see how you conduct yourselves in life","7:130":"We subjected Pharaoh and his people to a retributory punishment and made them suffer heavy damage. They were pined with dearth, hunger and drought for years that they may hopefully humble themselves to Him and lift to Him their inward sight","7:131":"Whenever they had good fortune on their side they attributed it to their merit, and whenever they were befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity, they attributed it to Mussa and his people who were esteemed birds of evil omen presaging some direful calamity. Indeed, events portending good or evil and all that is destined to happen, rest in the hands of Allah, notwithstanding the mould of a man's fortune is in himself, and the event when justified is sanctioned by Allah, but most of them fail to perceive this fact","7:132":"Being arrogant, obstinate men of little intelligence they said to Mussa: \"No matter how impressive and exciting the signs may be never shall we be convinced nor shall you be able to bring us to acknowledge the truth of your mission","7:133":"And there, We plagued them at intervals with","7:134":"As often as they were troubled grievously, they appealed to Mussa, to invoke Allah. His creator\", they said, \"in virtue of what He conferred on you of sufficient grace, to deliver us from this burdensome affliction which is exhaustive to the mind, and if you do we promise to acknowledge the truth of your mission and release the Children of Israel from bondage so that they be free to go with you","7:135":"Whenever We removed the cause of distress for a determined period of time to give them a chance to bring themselves to their senses, they promised Mussa they would pay heed. But no sooner they recovered than they broke their moral obligation, as if to confess themselves mistaken was opposed to their sense of personal dignity","7:136":"In consequence, We took just vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea in requital of their denial of Our signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority and their oblivion thereto","7:137":"And by divine grant did We bring those oppressed, into possession of the eastern and western parts of the land We had blessed*, and thus has the good word of Allah, your Creator, answered the purpose, and complied with the conditions of Bani Israel for their patience and endurance. And We ruined and buried all that Pharaoh and his people had erected of splendid structures and all that they laid as means or support","7:138":"And We brought Bani Israel safely across the sea, and there, they came across a people who paid divine honours to idols**. They demanded of Mussa to make for them an idol as an object of worship similar to the idols worshipped by those people. In response, said Mussa: \"You people are indeed ignorant and you are a wicked impudent boldfaced people who have no shame of their sins","7:139":"These people\", he said, \"worship dumb idols made of stone subject to min. And vain is he who puts his hope in an object of worship besides Allah","7:140":"Would I\", he added, \"induce you to pay reverence and veneration to a deity other than Allah, the Creator, and adore him (or it) with appropriate acts and rites, when it was He Who confined to you such prerogative as to be the chosen for His mercy and blessings out of all people","7:141":"And through His Omnipotence and Authority, We delivered you from the state of bondage and from the cruel impositions laid upon you by the Pharaonic who brutally slaughtered your sons and spared your women, and this was indeed a severe but a sure test of your actions and reactions echoing your true beliefs and the prevalent inclination among you","7:142":"Then We ordained the divine assignation for Mussa and arranged the place and the time when We would be exposed to his mental view after he had completed the exclusive religious devotion imposed on him for thirty nights complemented by ten more nights to total forty nights, the requisite for granting him an audience. And when the set time was fulfilled and Mussa was ready to have spiritual audience of Allah, his Creator, he said to his brother Harun: \"Take my place and act for me among my people and improve the state of things and put an end to abuse, disorder and malpractice and do not yield to those who are characterized by acts of prepensed malice","7:143":"When Mussa came to the place set for Our assignation, the hallowed environment spoke Allah's presence proclaimed by sound. And when Allah spoke to Mussa, he expressed his wish, thus: \"O Allah, my Creator\", he asked, \"may I perceive you by sight!\". \"You shall not be able to see Me\", said Allah, \"but look at the mountain\", if it remains standing in its place, you shall then see Me. And when Allah manifested to the mountain an infinitely short flash of His mercifully invisible glorious light, the mountain was levelled with the ground*. Terribly shocked, Mussa dropped unconscious, and when he recovered from the swoon, he prayed: \"Praise be to You O Allah and extolled are Your glorious attributes; in lowliest plight do I stand repentant and I am the first and foremost of those who conform to Your will","7:144":"I have chosen you O Mussa\", said Allah, \"by preference out of all people to convey My divide message and My discourse of practical divinity revealed directly to you\". \"Therefore, take all that I have imparted to you with heart and hand with heart and soul, and act strongly upon it and impel yourself to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness","7:145":"We set down for him in writing on the plates all that bore reference to every subject, affair, event, circumstance, concern, contention, dispute, litigation and the like, distinctly expressing all that was meant, leaving nothing merely implied. And We commanded him to act strongly upon all that was imparted to him and to enjoin his people to adopt those divine precepts that would be in their best interests. And We added: \"I will show your people the destined desolate abode and the destined insecure condition of those who grew daily more and more wicked","7:146":"I will\", said Allah, \"deafen the hearts' ears of those whose pride gets the better of their prudence, who exhibit unjustifiable inordinate self-esteem in the world they live on\". Whenever they see a sign clearly indicating Allah's Authority, they take pride in setting it to nought, and when they see the path of righteousness, they simply avoid it, but when they see the path of wickedness, they joyfully follow it, this turn of mind accords well with their persistent denial of Our signs they have been oblivious of","7:147":"And those who refuse to recognize Our revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority and reject the truth of Resurrection and the audience of Allah in Day of Judgement are born to be losers; their hopes shall be doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness. Shall they be requited but with what is commensurate with their deeds","7:148":"Influenced by idolatrous Egypt, the people of Mussa took advantage of his absence on the Mount, being absorbed in the intense spiritual communion with Allah, and melted all their gold ornaments and built a body in the image of a calf* lowing like cattle when down wind. Did they not perceive that it was mute! Never did it speak to them nor would it guide them or determine the course of events! Yet they reverenced it and adored it with appropriate acts and rites, and were wrongful of actions","7:149":"When they realized that they had committed themselves to an evil line of conduct and have wandered from the path of righteousness they said: \" Now, unless Allah, our Creator extends His mercy to us and forgives us, we will most certainly be great losers","7:150":"And when Mussa returned and found that his people have wronged themselves, he strongly resented their evil act, and so great was his indignation against them. Grieved at heart, he said: \"Evil indeed is what your minds and souls have you to do; did you wish Allah's punishment be hastened on! He dropped the plates and dragged his brother by the head, laying the blame on him, But Harun said to him: \" O son of my mother; the people judged me wanting in power and authority over them and almost killed me\". \"Therefore, do not let my enemies gloat over me and rejoice at my misfortune, nor should you associate me with the wrongful of actions","7:151":"Mussa then realized his unjustified assault upon his brother and turned to Allah invoking His forgiveness on behalf of himself and his brother, and added: \"O Allah, our Creator, we pray and beseech You to admit us into the realm of Your mercy","7:152":"Indeed those who reverenced the calf and adored it with appropriate acts and rites shall come within the measure of Allah's wrath and shall be incensed with humiliation in life below, for thus do We requite those who intentionally assert what is false","7:153":"But those who commit themselves to an evil line of conduct and soon thereafter stand repentant in lowliest plight and return to the obedience of Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues shall find Allah Ghafurun (forgiving), and Rahimun (Merciful)","7:154":"When Mussa returned to his settled calmness, he picked up the plates comprising in their text the spirit of truth guiding into all truth, and Allah's mercy toward those who fear testing Allah's indignation","7:155":"There, did Mussa choose from the innocent among his people seventy persons, in compliance with Allah's command to present themselves at the divine assignation. When they gathered at the arranged time and place, fearful echoes thundered in their ears and the earth's surface convulsed under their feet as an expression of strong divine reproach against those among them who committed themselves to the most evil conduct. There and then did Mussa pray, thus: \"O Allah, my Creator: had You willed you would have planted their Hereafter and mine before now\". \"Would you destroy us in requital of the evil committed by the simpleton among us!\". \" It is Your means of trial, You use it to subject people to the test and consequently deafen the hearts' ears of whom You will and open the minds' eyes of whom You will, You are our Tutelary Protector\". \"We beseech you to forgive us and to have mercy on us; You are the Most Merciful of all who forgive","7:156":"He added: \"We pray and beseech You to bestow on us Your prevenient and efficacious grace here, and Your efficacious grace Hereafter; we have surrendered ourselves to You and our purpose and cause to Your divine service\". \"My punishment\", said Allah, \"is a penalty I inflict on whom I will, and My mercy is extended to the wide circle of the all; I will accord it to those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Me. It is those who give alms and give credence to Our revelations and signs, with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues","7:157":"Who acknowledge the mission of Our Messenger, the unlettered Prophet whom they find well described in their AL-Tawrah (Torah) and AL-Injil (Gospel). Who enjoins them equity and the general principles of justice and forbids them all that is wrongful and obscene; He informs them of all that Allah has rendered lawful for them to eat and of all that is unlawful. He shall release them from the rules fettering them and from the restrictions imposed upon them, and release their minds from what had burdened them of anxious thoughts. Therefore, those who recognize his mission; give credence to his message, honour him, afford him the help he needs and act in accordance with the spiritual and intellectual enlightenment imparted to him, shall be the recipients of Allah's mercy and blessings and it is these whom Heaven shall prosper","7:158":"Say to them O Muhammad: O you people: you had better believe that I have been sent to you all with a divine message from Allah Who has the rightful claim to the heavens and the earth. Allah Who has the supreme controlling power and the absolute authority over them; there is no Ilah but Him Who gives life and occasions death. Therefore, you people had better believe in Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, and accept with consenting mind His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet who solemnly believes in Allah and His divine words -those inspired to him and to other Messengers before him-. You had better give credence; to his statement and discourse on practical divinity and follow him so that you may hopefully be guided to the path of righteousness","7:159":"Among the People of Mussa are some who used the spirit of truth to guide people into all truth and used it to implement the general principles of justice","7:160":"And We separated them into twelve divisions, nations as it were, - characterized by common descent from one of the twelve sons of Ya'qub (Jaco)","7:161":"We said to them \"You make abode in this town* and eat as you will, wherever you will. It is all replete with choice of all delights. Enjoy all that is wholesome and affords pleasure, but let your bosoms surge up and answer thanks and express your thoughts in words invoking Me to relieve your hearts and unload your burden of sins\", \"Humble yourselves and bow your knees to Me as you go through the gate \", \"then and only then will I forgive your iniquities and reward those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety with what runs higher than what corresponds with their piety","7:162":"But the wrongful of actions exchanged the virtuous spoken discourse authorized by heaven for the false discourse of their own making, and in consequence did Heaven come upon them with a forcible impact of a torturing punishment in requital of their wickedness","7:163":"Ask them about the town which stood by the see-front* where their minds and souls impelled them to transgress Allah's commandment and break the Sabbath ordained by Allah to be set apart for rest and worship. The fish were made to come to the surface on the Sabbath day, and to dive deep on other days; a means of trial to test their prevalent inclination. As was expected, being wicked, they yielded to temptation","7:164":"Those indifferent among the people of Mussa, said to those concerned: \"why waste your breath admonishing people destined to suffer annihilation or condemnation!\". \"This said the concerned, \"is only to discharge the duty imposed by Allah, your Creator, toward these people, they might hope fully open their hearts' ears and be dutiful to Him","7:165":"But when they counselled deaf to exhortation, We rescued those who urged them to laudable conduct and to doing homage and honour to Almighty Allah, and We put to the torment of misery and distress those wrongful of actions in requital of their prepensed malice","7:166":"When they insolently persisted in disobedience and buried exhortation in oblivion, We laid their transgression to their charge and decreed that they be monkeyfied and that their monkey- like character and behaviour be viewed with contempt, and that they be despised and rejected of men","7:167":"There and then did Allah, your Creator, proclaim He would send against them those who would persecute them till the Day of Resurrection. Allah, your Creator, is swift indeed in putting the law in execution, and He is also Ghafurun and Rahimun","7:168":"And We split them into separate aggregates forming communities among the populations of the various countries of the world; Among them are those who are virtuous, who instruct men in the way of righteous living, and others who are contrary in nature, in character and in tendency, who flourish on wickedness. We have tried them with interchange of favours and efficacious grace and with disfavors, misfortunes and disgrace that they may hopefully be dutiful to Allah","7:169":"Then, there came their successors on whom the weight of AL-Tawrah had devolved and the responsibility of subscribing to its precept had fallen. Yet they chose to go by the world and its vanities, and unmerited forgiveness haunted their imagination; They said: \"We will be forgiven our iniquities\", and in vanity they wasted their days. Every opportunity favourable to a wicked end or purpose gave them occasion to a burst of merriment. Do they not recall to the mind that they did subscribe to the covenant Allah had revealed in AL-Tawrah which they have carefully studied; the covenant forbidding them to relate to Allah but the truth and emphasizing that the Hereafter is infinitely far better and more advantageous to those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah. Can you - people- not reflect","7:170":"Nonetheless, those who adhere to AL-Tawrah and abide by it and observe their act of worship shall be recipients of Allah's mercy and blessings; We do not withhold nor withdraw the grateful return due to those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety","7:171":"And you Ahl AL-Kitab had better recall to the mind that once when your fathers camped at the foot of the Mount and heaven thundered and the awe - inspiring echoes thundered in their ears as We entered with them into a covenant, and We stabilized the Mount above them when it shook with such fits of awe for the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and they thought it was collapsing over their heads. There and then did We say to them: \" Adhere to all We have imparted to you -AL-Tawrah- and observe the code of discipline and body of regulations and hold them in esteem and hold to your promise and pay attention and regard to it and be mindful of Our commandments, you may hopefully entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Me","7:172":"Allah your Creator brings forth the progeny of the Children of Adam from their backs. Symbolized by a figure in human form so as to be witnesses of their own reaction to Allah, they were asked: \"Am I not your Creator!\" \"Indeed You are\", they answered. \"Then\", Allah said, \"You cannot deny this in Day of Judgment with the excuse that you were not aware of this fact","7:173":"Or you might say: \"Our fathers had incorporated with Allah other deities, and as their descendents, they have had much influence on our thoughts; will You O Allah subject us to the torment to pay a debt owed to You by the damned","7:174":"Thus do We expound Our revelations and render Our discourse readily understood so that they may hopefully he dutiful to Allah","7:175":"And narrate to the Jews O Muhammad the story of the Israelite to whom We imparted intellectual acquaintance with all the facts and We vested him with the power of comprehending Our signs.

This is exactly the similitude of those who deny Our revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority. Therefore, recourse O Muhammad to the narratives of such persons so that they may hopefully pause to think","7:177":"Evil indeed is the similitude of those who denied Our signs and refused to recognize Our revelations and were unreasonable and unjust to themselves","7:178":"Indeed he whom Allah guides to His path of righteousness is he who is guided by the spirit of truth into all truth, and those whom Allah does not guide to his path of righteousness are they who are born to be losers","7:179":"We have disposed to the abode in Hell many of the Jinn and mankind whom We had foreknown to be losers; they carry hearts stigmatized with dullness of comprehension and eyes lacking perception and they have no ears for admonition.

Some of your people chose to seize the unarmed caravan for easy gains, whereas Allah has willed that you go at the organized well armed troops which came to their aid, so that truth should triumph over falsehood and His words be verified as He uproots the infidels","8:8":"And as such, shall Allah vindicate the truth and blot out falsehood, offensive as it may be to those sinful idolaters","8:9":"You implored Allah's aid with touching entreaties and Allah responded favourably, thus: \"I will\", He said: \"uphold you with one thousand angels in sets succeeding one another","8:10":"We voiced this spiritual support to give you people mental comfort and joyful tidings and make your hearts return to their settled calmness, Indeed, victory comes only by the help of Allah Who is AL-Aziz (the Almighty), and Hakimun (Wise)","8:11":"And there did Allah replace the emotion of sorrow and grief which was caused by fear of the unpredictable outcome by peace of mind and sense of security thus inducing your eyes to take themselves to slumber. He sent down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain - water to free you people from foreign matter as well as from moral and spiritual pollution and from the incitement of evil instigated by AL-Shaytan (Satan) and by those with characteristics befitting Him, and to do your hearts good and set your feet firm","8:12":"There and then did Allah, your Creator, inspire the angels. Thus: \" I am acting with you\", Allah said: \"and so support the cause of those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and sustain them spiritually and help them take a firm position and set their feet firm\". \"I will inspire terror\", Allah added, \"in the hearts of those who are given to disbelief; strike them above the necks and strike their finger tips, their weak limbs and their failing joints","8:13":"This train of events succeeding one another were occasioned on account of their hostility to Allah and to His Messenger; and he who is hostile to Allah and His Messenger shall realize that Allah punishes severely indeed","8:14":"This is it you infidels, but that is not all; there awaits you the torment to be laid on the damned","8:15":"O you who have conformed to Islam: \"If you happen to meet with the infidels -the enemy to your faith- and you see they are marshaled for fighting you, do not turn your backs upon them nor reverse your course or retreat","8:16":"And he who turns his back, reverses his course or retreats, unless it be a stratagem for gaining advantage over the enemy or for falling back on other troops projected and directed as the larger military movement and operation of the campaign, will have come within the measure of Allah's wrath and be destined to the abode in Hell, and how evil is the destination","8:17":"You people must realize that it was not you who brought death upon the infidels but it was Allah Who destroyed them. It was not you O Muhammad who aimed when you spattered, but it was Allah Who directed the sand you hurled at your enemy. Nor was it you who deprived them of power when you threw the handful of sand at their faces, but it was Allah Who eclipsed their sight. Nonetheless, Allah has determined to test the quality of those who have conformed to Islam with gracious intentions; on the one hand with His prevenient grace producing the repentance and faith without which the grace of justification cannot be received and on the other hand with the efficacious grace really effecting the end for which it is given; Allah is indeed Sami'un (Omnipresent) with unlimited audition and 'Alimun (Omniscient)","8:18":"And so, this is it. Meantime Allah defies the infidels; He suspends their volition and renders their stratagem inefficient","8:19":"And you infidels, if you were looking for victory and judgement; your hopes have been doomed to disappointment; the Ka'ba belongs to those who have conformed to Islam. And if you exercise your faculty of volition toward peaceful existence and desist from the hostile course of action and your prudence gets the better of your pride, it would be to your advantage. But if your pride gets the better of your prudence and you resume hostilities, then the two sides shall inevitably meet again. And your troops, multitudinous as they will be, shall be of no advantage to you, for Allah upholds those whose hearts are faithful to Him","8:20":"O you who have conformed to Islam: Obey Allah and His Messenger and never withdraw from his presence when you are listening to his discourse on practical divinity","8:21":"Nor permit yourselves to be like those -the hypocrites- who pretended to have listened faithfully to the truth and pretended to abide by it when in fact they counselled deaf and closed their hearts' ears to discourses on practical divinity; there is speed in their dumbness","8:22":"Indeed, the worst creatures in Allah's sight are the deaf and dumb who are unwilling to hear nor heed","8:23":"Had Allah found in them any good He would have opened their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes and made their prudence get the better of their pride. And if He did, they would have turned away and counselled deaf to the spirit of truth that guides into all truth","8:24":"O you who have conformed to Islam: Respond favourably to Allah's commands and to the admonition by His Messenger when he invites you to lead a life that deserves the name, a life that is based on clean hearts and on divine knowledge and on denunciation of evil and ignorance and superstitions of later times. A life that is based on the faculty or sum of faculties of the mind or the soul by which one knows and reasons and exercises the power of thought and understanding. Life based on freedom from idolatry to the inanimate and the animate and on worshipping and obeying the One and Only -the Creator of the universe- Who gives life and occasions death. A life that is based on the quality of mind showing itself in facing danger without fear and based on kindness, compassion, benevolence and on religious and spiritual virtues. A life that is productive and fulfilling the normal purpose, so that it be meaningful, honourable and worth living. And you people had better realize that Allah intervenes between man and his heart to love or hate, to open its ears or counsel deaf, to be courageous or wanting courage, to be kind, or hard, to beat or fail and stop, and to Him shall all of you be thronged","8:25":"And avoid dissension, temptation and discord which may be brewed by some and practiced by others. The fatal consequence does not fall only on the wrongful but it unites all of you, and you must realize that Allah punishes severely","8:26":"Remember, you were some few viewed with contempt, living in fear of persecution, abduction and exile, and Allah put you under His tutelage, gave you shelter and made you strong in influence and authority and gave you security of position and reinforced you by His additional support and made victory sit on your helm. He provided you with victuals of the various good and wholesome kinds hoping you would impel yourselves to gratitude and gratefulness","8:27":"O you who have conformed to Islam : Do not prove false to the trust nor to Allah and His Messenger Who trusted you nor knowingly misappropriate anything that has been entrusted to you","8:28":"And you must realize that your wealth and your progeny are but a temptation and a means of trial to test your spiritual and moral attributes, your accomplishments and attainments as well as your course of actions. Do not forget that in Allah's realm you obtain the ultimate of your desires","8:29":"O you who have conformed to Islam: If you entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, He will confer on your souls the faculty of knowing and reasoning, of thought and understanding, so that you can perceive the difference between right and wrong, have the capacity to discriminate one individual from another and constitute a difference between the powers of good and evil to the end that He blots out your iniquities. He is the source of sufficient grace abounding in whom He will and of efficacious grace which really effects the end for which it is given","8:30":"And remember O Muhammad how the infidels, with cleverness in circumventing, had recourse to stratagem tending to take you as prisoners and keep you in bondage or kill you, and in His plan did Allah also have recourse to stratagem, and who can gain advantage on Allah","8:31":"When Our revelations are recited to them. They insolently say: \"We have heard, and the like of this we heard before, and if we will we could discourse the like thereof. This is nothing but fables of old","8:32":"And remember O Muhammad when their pride and insolence got the better of their prudence and they said: O Allah, \"if this is a divine discourse revealed from Your heaven's realm, then pour down upon us from the floor of the vault of heaven a rain of stones or a rain of large blows","8:33":"But Allah was not going to rain on them large blows while you are in their midst, nor was He going to put them to the torment before giving them plenty of rope to allow them free scope so that they either commit themselves and deserve annihilation or be sober minded, stand repentant and invoke Allah's forgiveness","8:34":"What excuse can they offer now to justify their wrongful deeds and bar prosecution! Therefore there is no reason why Allah should make them suffer for their offense. They have abused the act of grace and fallen from grace. They malevolently obstructed the way to the Sacrosanct House when they are not its guardians. Its guardians are those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah but most of these do not realize this fact","8:35":"Their prayer at the Sacrosanct House was simply featured in whistling and applause. Therefore, you infidels have well deserved to be put to the torment in requital of infidelity","8:36":"These infidels spend their money in the warring campaigns of disbelief against belief with the motive principle of obstructing the way to the path of Allah, the path of righteousness. They shall spend until they exhaust themselves and suffer losses, and then lament the events and circumstances with sighing. Then shall reason conquer passion and they lose the field and be subdued, and all infidels shall be thronged into Hell","8:37":"Such an amount of money spent in the war of disbelief against belief brings the two opposing sides into contact. There and then does Allah distinguish those who prevail upon themselves to serve Him and expose those who perform half - heartedly and those croakers who are always boding their ruin, He sums up the evidence of all evil and adds it together and casts all who have an evil savour in their composition into Hell; these are they who were born to be losers","8:38":"Tell O Muhammad these infidels: if they are willing to renounce infidelity, desist from evil purpose and turn to Allah, they will be forgiven their past iniquities. But should they resume hostilities and persist in their intentional assertion of falsehood, then suffice it to say that Allah's mode of action pursued in the past for each typical instance of punishment shah not alter","8:39":"So conditioned, then, fight against them the good fight of faith until persecution comes to an end and concord replaces discord and Allah's system of faith and worship prevails, and people take upon themselves: The recognition of Allah and His control of destiny, His rightful claim to obedience, reverence and worship, and the general mental and moral attitude resulting from this belief and its effect upon the individual and the people at large. If they desist and turn to Allah, He certainly is Bassirun(graceful and kind to his servants), He sees all that they do","8:40":"But if they refuse and counsel deaf, then you Muslims must realize that Allah is your tutelary Guardian and how Ultimate in excellence is the Protector, and the Ultimate of ultimate to afford help","8:41":"And you Muslims must realize that whatever you capture from your enemy in the way of spoils of war, comes under Allah's Authority. One fifth is assigned to Allah and His Messenger, to the kindred and to the orphans and the needy, that is if the heart of your purpose is indeed Allah's purpose and you have exercised your minds in thought and contemplation conferred on Our Messenger and on your souls to vindicate the powers of good and beat down the powers of evil when the two forces met, and Allah is Qadirun over all things; He overrules personal aims","8:42":"You were on the near side of the valley and the infidels on the far side, and the caravan below you marching by; a web of circumstance calculated and timely arranged by the Omnipotent. Had you tried to plan such a precise arrangement you would have failed. Allah had planned it in such a manner as to serve His purpose and to help you obtain an advantage over your enemy who outnumbered you to a great disproportion, the survivors among the infidels will then realize that their defeat was made by Allah's Omnipotence and Authority and the survivors among the Muslim victors realize Allah's Omnipotence and Sovereignty and Allah is indeed Sami'un with unlimited audition and 'Alimun","8:43":"Allah O Muhammad -in His infinite mercy has presented to your mind in your sleep the troops of the infidels as being some few- at the psychologically appropriate moment in which your minds were in actual expectation of war to happen. Had He presented them to you in your vision as being multitudinous you would have been smitten with mental anguish and dismay and you would have fallen into dispute, but Allah saved the situation; He is 'Alimun of all that is brewed secretly in the breasts","8:44":"When the two forces met, We influenced your minds' eyes so as you view them as being some few, and you would be viewed as being some few, so that you assail each other, and Allah's purpose would be served as has been enacted, and to Allah, the Ultimate Authority are committed and submitted all matters and all affairs for consideration, decision and execution here and Hereafter","8:45":"O you who have conformed to Islam: When you come upon an encounter with a troop of your enemies; do-not waver, but be resolute and firm, and think of Allah and call Him to mind as often as you can so that Heaven may help you gain the upper hand","8:46":"Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not contend with each other with opposing arguments lest your hopes should be doomed to disappointment and you lose heart, and the wind be taken out of your sails. Have patience and remember that Allah upholds the patient","8:47":"And be not like those* who left their homes -for battle- displaying deliberately and ostentatiously their might in order to, attract notice, win admiration and warn others; they aimed at obstructing the way to the path of Allah, the path of righteousness, but Allah is Omniscient of all that they do","8:48":"They were befooled by AL-Shaytan and those with characteristics befitting him who allured them to brighter worlds as a logical result and sequence to their doings and led the way. \"Rest assured \", AL-Shaytan said, \" that no man can overpower you today in battle and I will be by your side\". But when the two forces met** he turned on his heels and reversed his position declaring his innocence of their ills, and said: \"I see with my mind's eyes what you cannot see; I fear Allah Whose torment is laid upon the damned","8:49":"There and then said those in whose hearts reigned vice, the hypocrites and those with ill-natured hearts- thus: \"How foolish the Muslims are to challenge such a large force; they are befooled by their religion which induced them to attack a great and superior force!\". But he who puts his trust in Allah, shall find Allah 'Azizun and Hakimun","8:50":"If you could only see the infidels when the angels of death besiege them all about to disembody their souls, how they descend violently upon them striking their faces and their backs, and say to them: \" Now you shall taste the torment of the Fire laid upon the damned","8:51":"This is in the train of the evil deeds your wrongful and unclean have committed, and Allah is not unjust to His servants","8:52":"These peoples' disposition and attitude of mind do not differ from those of the Pharaoh and his people and their predecessors; they denied Allah and rejected His signs and revelations; so great was Allah's indignation against them for their wickedness that He took them by storm. Allah is indeed Qawiyun (Omnipotent); His torment is laid upon the damned","8:53":"This reasoning is based on Allah's justified course of action adopted as an expedient. He never withdraws nor changes His merited or unmerited favour He graced a given nation with until they change their own minds' attitude and the disposition of their innermost being, Allah is indeed Sami'un (with unlimited audition), and 'Alimun","8:54":"A reasoning marked by circumspection: it is attentive to all circumstances that may affect action, circumstances that are similar to those of the Pharaoh and his people and their predecessors who were united in their innate quality. They abused Allah's grace and by consequence fell from grace; they denied Allah's signs and revelations and persisted in their intentional assertion of falsehood. As a result, We destroyed them in requital of their willful violation of the divine law and their transgression against Allah and His commands. We drowned Pharaoh and his People; they were all wrongful of actions","8:55":"Indeed, the worst creatures in Allah's sight are those whose hearts' ears are closed and whose minds' eyes are blind, who counsel deaf to divine discourse and disavow Allah","8:56":"Who concluded with you O Muhammad a truce and resolved to cause a discord to pass into a concord, yet they break every agreement contracted for amity and peace, and never do they entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah","8:57":"Therefore, whenever and wherever you Muslims meet them in an active hostile contention, reduce them into a useless form to set an example of their humiliation serving as a deterrent to those who attempt thereafter to war against you","8:58":"Should you suspect treachery on the part of a people with whom you have concluded a peace treaty, let them know that you have cancelled your vow just the same; Allah detests indeed the treacherous","8:59":"And those infidels who deny Allah must realize that they have not escaped His divine attributes of Prescience and Omniscience nor shall they deter Him from afflicting them with a retributive punishment","8:60":"And prepare for them you Muslims all you can recruit of strength: armed forces and mounted troops- to strike terror into the hearts and minds of Allah's enemy who is your enemy, and into the hearts and minds of others whom you do not know but Allah knows them.

Now, you taste the torment which is laid on the damned in requital of hoarding up money and cheating the poor of their due and Allah of divine service","9:36":"The calendar introduced by Allah when He created the universe -the heavens and the earth- determines the month as the space of time from one new moon to the next, corresponding to the period of one complete revolution of the moon in reference to a point, faxed or movable, and divides the year accordingly into twelve revolutions or months, four of which are sacred and exclusively appropriated to some special purpose emblematic of this right and commendable religion. Therefore, do not wrong yourselves during this period of time nor discredit yourselves by word or thought. And fight the idolaters in the whole as they fight you in the whole and do realize that Allah upholds those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him","9:37":"To transpose a sacred month in favour of another month is to add to infidelity. Such a practice, as being adopted by the Pagans, made them sink deeper under the vexation of their minds; they permit it one year and forbid it another year so as to adjust means to ends and arrange them suitably to the number ordained by Allah, a practice that sets them at defiance with Allah in as much as it permits a course of action forbidden by Him. Thus were the Pagans enticed by their deeds of evil and iniquity that allured their minds' eyes and induced them to hug their irreverent conviction to their hearts and were swayed from the path of righteousness. Allah never guides to His path of righteousness the infidels whose aim is to defy Him","9:38":"O you who have conformed to Islam: what ails you that you are indisposed to action! When you are told to strive in the cause of Allah you cling heavily to the ground! Have you come to be worldly - minded and content with life here afore that Hereafter! But how little are the material and the immaterial things that minister to enjoyment and content here as compared with Hereafter","9:39":"Unless you respond favourably to the Messenger's call to serve Allah and be moved to action and fight the good fight of faith against disbelief, you will be pained at heart; Allah will afflict you, in His own way, with a condign punishment and replace you by others, and your indisposition to His purpose shall not harm Him in the least; Allah is Qadirun (Omnipotent) over all things","9:40":"If you do not afford him help and assist him in the accomplishment of Allah's purpose, you must realize that Allah graced him with triumph over his enemies -Quraish- who plotted for his life. Prompted by Allah and actuated by divine influence he left home with no one but his companion* to whom he was his second. In the cave** where they both hid, He said to his companion: Rest assured and do not grieve; we are not two but three; Allah is in our presence There and then did Allah inspire peace and tranquility as well as just confidence to the heart and mind of His Messenger and the thoughts were conveyed to one another, and He upheld him and supported him with an invisible array of angels. There, did Allah make what the infidels had forged in their breasts to what their tongues have vented fail to accord. Thus, was what they declared in words debased and the Word of Allah, supreme and dominant, is as always at the top; Allah is Azizun (Almighty) and Hakimun","9:41":"Move to action and fight the good fight of faith, each in his capacity, lightly armed and heavily armed, infantry and mounted troops men and women, old and young, rich and poor. Every hand must be open to contribute something to the common purpose, and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives, a continuous series of operations constituting the whole. Such a campaign is to your advantage if only you knew. It kills the attempt your enemy has made to shake the dominion Allah intends to establish, it makes the final victory sit on your helm and brings you peace of mind and it helps you prevail and confirm Allah's system of faith and worship","9:42":"Had the expedition been a short distance and they were confident their march would attain its worldly end, they would have followed you. But the distance disenchanted their minds and appeared toilsome. They will swear to you O Muhammad that they would have gone out with you to fight had they been able to do so. They are the cause of their own destruction, and Allah knows that they are liars","9:43":"Allah bless you O Muhammad! Why did you grant them permission to be among the stay-at- home before sifting them in action to find out the truthful, and expose those who lie in their teeth","9:44":"Never shall those who lift to Allah their inward sight and assert the truth of the Hereafter ask you to exempt them from this obligation. They feel they must move to action as ordained by Allah Whose purpose is the heart of their purpose. They purpose to strive in His cause, which is their cause with their wealth and their lives. Allah is fully aware of those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him","9:45":"For laboured impiety; what apology can be invented but by those who deny Allah and the Day of Judgement and their deep-rooted doubt affects their hearts and their minds profoundly, and in their objective uncertainty they vacillate","9:46":"Had they been disposed in mood and mind to obey such advice as Allah inclines them to propound, they would have made all preparations necessary for overpowering the assailant who is quick, skillful and deadly. But being fully aware of their innermost thoughts and of what their breasts forge, Allah disliked their participation in the campaign, and discouraged them and impelled them to the feeling of utter demoralization and it was decided that they join the stay-at-home","9:47":"Had they joined you in battle, they would have caused discord and hastened to sow dissension, slander and thoughts of sedition among you, And among you are attentive hearers who bow down their ears to them. Allah is 'Alimun of all the wrongful of actions","9:48":"They made it their aim before truth prevailed to sow thoughts of sedition and discord and the wicked plotted against the just. They deranged your ordinary pursuits of life O Muhammad as well as your divine course of action, hoping you would not prevail and firmly establish Allah's system of faith and worship. But great is truth and it did prevail, and there did Allah's word, as is always expected, assume the top, notwithstanding their opposition and their evil feeling","9:49":"Among them is he who asks you O Muhammad to exempt him from participating in the expedition lest he succumbs to temptation; He says to you: \"Exempt me from this obligation and do not let me fall into temptation\". Indeed, into error and impiety, into temptation and turmoil, into insurgency and insurrection of ignorance and into persecution by Heaven have they fallen, and Hell besets the infidels who deny Allah","9:50":"When good fortune falls in your way, be it through victory or through martyrdom, they come to be actuated with envy and grieved at heart. But if you are befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity, they rejoice beyond a common joy and express their thoughts in words, thus: \"With prudent foresight\" they say, \"we exercised caution beforehand to provide against misfortunes and turmoil\", and they turn their backs and go away well pleased","9:51":"Say to them: Nothing befalls us good fortune or misfortune, victory or martyrdom, defeat or retreat, but has been divinely assessed and justly determined by Allah. He is our tutelary guardian and in Allah should those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand put their trust","9:52":"Say to them: \" Do you give yourselves up to the first anticipations of your thoughts! But only one of two things can happen to us, and either of them is but an advantage, martyrdom or victory. As for you, we do anticipate an inevitable retributive punishment either from heaven or at our hands. Therefore, await the event that shall come in due time and we are also waiting","9:53":"Say to these hypocrites: \"You may spend as much as you like, willingly or unwillingly, making great pretences to religion, but never shall your contributions be acknowledged nor be entered on the credit side of your account. You are a people whose wickedness has reached beyond your reach; it has reached the sky","9:54":"The reason for refusing to acknowledge their contributions is their unforgivable grave offence against Allah; an offence no amount of money can expiate. They deny Allah and His Messenger, they perform their act of worship with an attitude of mind dispirited and despondent and they spend in Allah's service with great disinclination and reluctance","9:55":"Do not let the splendour of their riches and their progeny excite your emotion by astonishment mingled with bewildered curiosity. Allah intends to make these attributes the cause of their suffering here below, through unrest and anxiety, and their souls shall be disembodied captivated by disbelief","9:56":"And they insolently made a solemn declaration with an appeal to Allah that they are your co-religionists and therefore a part of you, when in fact together with you they do not make up a whole. They are a people who display ignoble fear in the face of danger, and they think they can avoid exciting your indignation","9:57":"If they can find a place of refuge or a cave or a hiding place, they will withdraw hastily from your society and fly to it","9:58":"Among these hypocrites are some who question your integrity in the way you distribute the spoils and Zakat and try to defame you. They disregard Allah's fundamental motive and reason of action and tend to go by their selfish motive principle. If they go share and share alike, they approve their hearts to Allah, and if they do not have a good share in what is distributed, they express their disapprobation and moral condemnation","9:59":"Had they been satisfied in mind with the divine fundamental assumption forming the basis of a chain of reasoning that guides the Messenger to action and said: \"so be it, we are contented with Allah; His bounty will abound in us directly and through His Messenger and to Him we do homage and suit\", it would have been to their advantage","9:60":"(Zakat is but a vehicle of prayers; it is due only to:a) The poor who are destitute of means of livelihood andb) The needy who are in temporary distress due to sickness, disability or the like.c) Those who are engaged as collectors and administrators thereof andd) Those who have just reconciled themselves with their own hearts and with Allah,e) Those in bondage -who are eager to buy their freedom-f) Those in debt -who are genuinely unable to pay what is owed to others-g) The support of the cause of Allah andh) And the wayfarer -who does not have the means for transportation and has to travel on foot.This is an obligation incumbent on Muslims and dutiful to Allah","9:61":"Among these hypocrites are also those who prejudice the Prophet and label him: \"all ears\". \"He attentively listens to all that is being said, be it false or true; he is easily deceived\". Say to them: \"He bows down his ear and listens graciously to all that is of advantage to you\"; he believes those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand and he is not deceived by those whom he perceives are lying\". \"He solemnly believes in Allah and trusts those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand for whom he is Allah's given mercy\". Indeed those who prejudice the Prophet shall suffer the torment laid upon the damned","9:62":"They are reluctant to join you in battle and offer you some excuse and affirm it by an appeal to Allah so that you accept it, when it is Allah and His Messenger that they should conciliate by fighting in their cause if in fact their hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues","9:63":"Do they not know that he who sets himself against Allah and His Messenger shall suffer the fire of Hell wherein he will have passed through nature to eternal suffering, and this is indeed disgrace to the extreme","9:64":"Those hypocrites are subconsciously afraid of being found out, fearing lest a Surah should be revealed betraying their real character and their ill-natured hearts which they wish be kept secret. Say to them: \"Hold whom you will in ridicule and laugh him to scorn. Allah shall expose your attributes you have always hoped would be kept secret","9:65":"And if you should ask them O Muhammad after their real nature has been betrayed, as to why did they plunge into defaming religion and disobeying Allah and His Messenger and laugh them to scorn! They would insolently say: We always plunge into worldly ambition and like to turn matters into a joke. Say to them: Do you make Allah, His revelations and His Messenger the object of a joke and laugh them to scorn","9:66":"Do not vindicate your grievous wrong now by a prologue and an apology You have turned renegades. If We forgive some of you because of coming back to their senses, We will punish others who are indeed wicked","9:67":"The hypocrites -men and women- spring from one another and complement each other. They enjoin what is evil and forbid what is just and right. They keep their hands tightly shut, unwilling to spend in divine service and fail to recall Allah to mind and by consequence Allah has neglected them. Indeed the hypocrites are faithless, perverse and morally depraved","9:68":"Allah has promised the hypocrites the men and the women together with those who deny Him and disregard His authoritative commands the fire of Hell wherein they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering; Hell claims them as her own. Allah has cursed them and they shall suffer the torment laid upon the damned","9:69":"You hypocrites stand similitude exact of those who preceded you. They were mightier than you are and they lived in greater affluence of wealth and progeny. They enjoyed all that afforded pleasure and was of sensuous character and they neglected all that was dutiful to Allah. Similarly you enjoy all that affords pleasure and is of sensuous character in the same way as those who preceded you; you plunged into worldly ambition the same as they plunged themselves into defaming religion and disobeying Allah. You and such persons are those whose hopes shall be doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness here and Hereafter, and all of you were born to be losers","9:70":"Have they not been informed of what became of their predecessors -the people of Nuh (Noah) and those of 'Ad, the people of Thamud and those of Ibrahim(Abraham), the people of Shuaib -the Madianites- and those of Lut (Lot) - the subverted cities-. All of them received Messengers who brought them divine illumination and enlightenment. Never was Allah going to do them. injustice, but it was they who wronged themselves","9:71":"And those of the men and the women whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand are mutual friends; they have a sincere reciprocation of all their kind feelings, they enjoin what is just and right and forbid what is evil, they faithfully and regularly engage in the act of worship and give Zakat; and they obey Allah and His Messenger. These shall Allah have mercy on them and bless their souls. Indeed Allah is Azizun, and Hakimun","9:72":"Allah has promised the men and the women whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues, blissful gardens in the realm of heaven; gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which flow rivers flow wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity.

They meditated mischief featured in their plan to kill you on returning from battle* field, but their attempt upon your life utterly failed. And instead of impelling themselves to gratitude and gratefulness for your presence –in Madina which made Heaven endow them with prosperity, justice and suppression of selfishness; they attempted to avenge Allah's grace by returning evil for good.

They bombarded them with foul epithets and laughed them to scorn. Allah has mocked them and betrayed their wicked attributes and destined them to a condign punishment","9:80":"You may invoke Allah's forgiveness on their behalf O Muhammad or you may not; it is one and the same. Even if you invoke Allah's forgiveness on their behalf seventy times, never shall He forgive them.

Yet the infidels dispute the facts with perspicuous energy, declaring that this, man - Muhammad- is simply a necromancer who stands manifest of sorcery","10:3":"Allah, your Creator is He Who has created the heavens and the earth in six* days determined by His own unit of time and proclaimed in His calendar. Then set He Himself on the Throne of supremacy and dominion, of grace and mercy. He conducts all affairs, and no intercessor is permitted to intercede on behalf of another without His permission.

He determined the divisions of the ecliptic*** for the moon to occupy them on successive days and present its phases according to the extent of its illumination**. This helps you to know the number of the years or reckon the time occupied by the sun in its apparent passage through the signs of the Zodiac and the period of the earth's revolution round the sun forming a natural unit of time, so that you be able to compute time and determine it by calculation. Never did Allah institute this and bring it about but for a serious end that conforms with the truth and agrees with reality. Thus does Allah expound His revelations and render His discourse readily understood by those who reflect","10:6":"Indeed, in the variation in duration besides the constant alternation and succession symbolic of the night and the day* in addition to all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth are evident signs betokening Allah's Omnipotence and Authority to people who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him","10:7":"Indeed, those who do not entertain the thought and belief of meeting with Allah and facing Him resolutely, and they are content with life here and rest assured and satisfied with it and they are oblivious of His signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority, are they who have lost their way","10:8":"Such persons were born to be losers. Their abode is Hell in requital of what their minds and souls have impelled them to do","10:9":"But those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety, shall be recipients of Allah's mercy and grace.

O you people, who do not keep a promise nor honour a vow: You had better realize that your imprudence works against your own interest: The enjoyment in life here is evanescent and fleeting and suddenly and soon enough shall you be on your way back to us, and there and then We shall inform you of all that your minds and souls have impelled you to do","10:24":"Life here below stands similitude exact of the soil which is stirred to activity and swells up by absorption of the rain water falling from the floor of the vault of heaven. The water is imbibed by soil which constitute the victuals of both man and animal causing the vegetal growths to flourish and grow healthy and vigorous. The earth is rendered beautiful and pleasing to the senses and the world comes to be adorned and furnished with all that is ornamental, the natural and the artificial, and when its inhabitants begin to think that it shall always minister to their necessities and pleasure and they are now the masters thereof, there comes Our command to pass by night or by day to convince mankind that it is not in mortals to command success, and we mow it down as if it never flourished the day before.

Yet when you O Muhammad say to them that they shall rise again at the Last Day after they had been dead and buried, the infidels shall say: \" This is nothing but sheer sorcery assumed by him","11:8":"And if We in all manner of wisdom delay their retributive punishment to a determined point of time giving them a chance to come-back to their senses, they shall say: \"What keeps it back!\" Indeed the Day the punishment comes about and falls to their lot, no expedient shall ever avert it, and on all sides shall they be beset by the same material and immaterial things they turned in to ridicule","11:9":"And if We should extend to man Our mercy and make him taste Our benediction then We justly decide to withhold it, he nurses despair forgetting the other advantages he enjoys and looks for the how, the why and the wherefore and becomes sour and in bitterness he turns his, worst side outwards","11:10":"And if We reverse the action and grace him with a merited or an unmerited favour following a touch of misfortune, he says: \"Now I have been freed of misfortunes\", and he rejoices beyond a common joy and he boasts the event and exalts himself unduly and displays inordinate self-esteem","11:11":"Such an attitude is never adopted by those who exercise patience and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety. Such persons are the recipients of Allah's mercy and forgiveness and deserve a great reward","11:12":"You Muhammad seem inclined to omit the recital of a part of what is revealed to you, the part that depresses your spirits and oppresses your thoughts and feelings because it is not to the infidel's liking. You think that by so doing, Allah's message of truth would be accepted more readily and the infidels shall not use the usual formula of insolence and say: \"If only a treasure were sent down to him from heaven or an angel to companion him, we may be induced to recognize his mission\". You must realize that you are only a spectacle and a warning, and Allah is the Tutelary Guardian of the whole and of all in all","11:13":"Or do they say: \"He has forged it\" the Quran! Say to them: \"You people are magniloquent; your art of speaking and writing is irresistibly impressive; wherefore do produce ten forged Surahs, each bearing reference to a different aspect of the same thought and call on those besides Allah whom you can possibly engage to venture upon this undertaking if indeed you are declaring the truth","11:14":"And if they do not respond and such an undertaking they fail to fulfill, then you people must realize that the Quran has indeed originated from Allah and revealed by His Authority, and there is no Ilah but He.

They follow but the same system their fathers have adopted before. We will apportion to them their share of punishment commensurate with their evil deeds, a punishment which shall neither be diminished nor be abated","11:110":"Perhaps Allah will not subject them to annihilation here below on account of the Book -the Quran- which gives free circulation of divine enlightenment and information. The same course of action was adopted when We gave Mussa the Book - AL-Tawrah (the Torah)- and his people were disputant about it, and had it not been for Allah's word proclaimed beforehand to put punishment in respite, their Hereafter would have been planted in the now. Those people were as suspicious of AL- Tawrah, as your people -O Muhammad- are of the Quran","11:111":"Nonetheless, both those and these and all and each shall Allah, your- Creator, requite with what is commensurate with their deeds; He is 'Alimun (Omniscient) indeed of all that their minds and souls impel them to do","11:112":"Therefore, you Just tread -O Muhammad- together with those who turned to Allah the path of life and action in the manner ordained and lift to Him your inward sight the best you can so as to be men of singular piety, righteousness and virtue.

He is Bassirun (Omnipresent) and He sees all that your minds and souls impel you to do","11:113":"Nor should your hearts be inclined to follow the wrongful of actions lest you come to be fuel for the Fire, and besides Allah you just have no tutelary protectors nor shall you be afforded the needed help","11:114":"Observe your act of worship at both ends of the day -the early morning and the close of the day- and at the early hours of the night -following sunset and before bed time- and keep in mind that pious and virtuous deeds cancel evil deeds. This is simply a reminder for those who keep Allah in mind and lift to Him their inward sight","11:115":"In patience possess you people your souls, therefore, be patient and remember that Allah does not annul, withhold or withdraw the fruit people are entitled to reap from deeds of wisdom and piety","11:116":"If only there had been among the preceding generations a class of persons virtuous, strong and influential enough to warn people against corruption and to forbid mischief on earth and prohibit perversion as did the few of them whom We saved. But the wrongful of actions pursued pleasure, and lust after the mundane vanity they were entangled with, and were steeped in crime","11:117":"Nor would Allah, your Creator, unjustly destroy the towns when their inhabitants are brewing reform and the fundamental truth governs their thoughts","11:118":"And had Allah, your Creator, willed, He would have made mankind one single nation conforming to one religion. Nonetheless, their innate incongruity would have induced them to be thus still at variance","11:119":"But not those whom Allah has graced with His mercy. In this Manner of freedom of choice and of thinking did He bring mankind into being. Thus has the word of Allah, your Creator, answered the purpose and complied with His decree, thus: \"I will fill Hell with the Jinn together with mankind who were wrongful of actions, guilty of defiant impiety and whose lawless desires were seas scorning all bounds","11:120":"We relate to you O Muhammad these various narratives of the Messengers who were sent before you, representing their determined effort under difficulties to accomplish the necessary end.

Allah, your Creator is indeed 'Alimun (Omniscient) and Hakimun (Wise)","12:7":"Indeed, there have been in the story of Yusuf and his brothers an instructive occurrence, an example, a warning and a lesson for those who are seeking the world and its pursuits as well as for those who are in search of the truth and spiritual knowledge","12:8":"Conspiring against him, the brothers said: \"Yusuf and his brother -full brother, Benjamin- are indeed nearer to our father's heart and closer to his affection than we are, our father stands indeed manifest of error; he manifests forth a straying mind","12:9":"They settled the question and pronounced judgment: \"Remove Yusuf out of the way\" they said, \"either by death or by taking him away to some distant land, and thereafter you stand in lowliest plight repentant to Allah of your evil deed and characterize yourselves with righteous living","12:10":"But one of them said: \"Do not kill Yusuf, for such an act shall be a grave error that threatens a fatal result; throw him down the well where he would be out of sight, and there, he will be picked up by some company of merchants, travellers or others, that is if you have indeed decided to get rid of him","12:11":"And so, they asked their father: \"Our father, why do you not trust us for the care of Yusuf! Our first wish in life is for his happiness and welfare","12:12":"Send him with us tomorrow\", they said, \"to enjoy himself, to eat and drink in a picnic fashion and to take part in a game affording him pleasure, and we will take care of him and see that he is not exposed to danger","12:13":"It grieves me at heart to part with him,\" said the father \"especially when I have an uneasy sense of the probability of the boy being brutally assailed and devoured by a wolf at a moment when you are oblivious of him it","12:14":"They protested, thus: \"If this be true\"t, they said, \"and the wolf were to devour him when we are a collective mass of men, then we will have incurred privation of attributes and it would be a lost sorrow to wail our fall","12:15":"And they took him and went away, and agreed among themselves, and were united in thought, to place him at the bottom of the well -said to have been dry-. There and then We inspired just confidence and peace of mind to him -Yusuf- and inspired him with the feeling, thus: \"You shall one day inform them of the evil they had committed against you at a time when they fail to recognize you nor perceive ever they shall see you again","12:16":"And they came back home to their father in the evening weeping their fill","12:17":"They said to him: \"O father, we went racing to compete with each other leaving Yusuf to take care of our things and there, standing alone, he was devoured by the wolf\". \"But you do not seem to believe us albeit we are telling the truth","12:18":"They brought back his garment stained with false blood. Their father said: \"Indeed your minds and souls have enticed you to do something unpleasant and impelled you to feign this tale; in patience do I possess my soul and in Allah do I seek help to bear with composure what you have just described","12:19":"There came a caravan of merchants traveling to Egypt with merchandise. They sent on their water purveyor, the harbinger, who found a well; he let his bucket to draw water. But as he hauled up the bucket, he did not find water but a youth clinging to the rope and the bucket instead. There he announced with joy the good news of hauling up a youth, and they hid him in their merchandise, and Allah was fully aware of what they were doing","12:20":"They sold him to a slave-dealer for a small price amounting to a small number of silver coins, and they had no interest in him","12:21":"Being divinely gifted with the letter of credit nature has written upon his face honoured wherever presented, he was outbid in the slave market by a high court Egyptian official (AZIZ) who said to his wife: \" Treat him kindly and with honour and respect to enjoy his stay; he may prove useful to us and helpful in effecting a purpose, or we may adopt him as a son.\" Thus did We establish him firmly in the land, wherefore We imparted to him the knowledge of interpreting visions and sense impressions in sleep and what they prefigure of future events. Allah prevails upon His edict which inevitably produces its intended effect and answers its purpose, but most people do not realize this fact","12:22":"Then when he –Yusuf- reached the stage of life wherein he had the ability for effective action and firmness of mind, character, will and purpose, We imparted to him wisdom and divine knowledge. For thus do We reward those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence","12:23":"The lady of the house -wife of the high official- where he lived, tried to induce him to surrender his chastity; she closed the doors and said to him: \"Come to me\". But he said: \"Allah forbid, He is my Creator; He has been kind to me, He delivered me from harm and gave me a good home and my master gave me a hearty welcome and a hospitable reception in his house; no, but never shall heaven prosper the wrongful of actions","12:24":"She had a passionate and libidinous desire of him, a desire she meant to bring to effect physically, and he had a desire of her, a desire that was psychical. It might have been physical, had he not felt Allah in his bosom and the internal recognition of the moral quality of one's motives and actions approving the right and condemning the wrong. We stirred his mind and his heart to live in the conscientious practice of all that is good so that We guard him from evil and immorality; He was indeed one of Our sincere worshippers","12:25":"To escape the threatened evil he ran to the door: as she chased him she could only reach the hack of his garment, and in his struggle to advance forward, the back of his garment was torn. The master was just coming in and they all met at the door. To justify her action and have her revenge, she said to her husband: \"What punishment should be appropriate for someone who tried to assail your wife's virtue but that he be imprisoned or suffers a condign punishment","12:26":"He -Yusuf- said: \"She tried to incite me to an immoral act,\". When the family gathered to judge the case, one of them wisely said: \"if his garment is torn at the front, then she is in the right and the truth is on her side, and\" he is lying","12:27":"And\", he added, \"if his garment is torn at the back then she is lying and he has fact upon his side","12:28":"When her husband saw the garment torn at the back, he said: \" This is one of your intrigues, you women; potent indeed is your cunning which you take for a sinister and crooked wisdom","12:29":"Yusuf\", he continued, \"let go this incident, and you, my wife, invoke Allah's forgiveness; you were indeed in the wrong","12:30":"The rumour circulated among some women -the society- in the city. They said: \"The wife of the court officer solicits her slave; she is much enamoured of him and inflamed with love; we see that she is indeed vitiated by error","12:31":"When she heard of their evil intent aggravating her guilt, she invited them to her house and gave them a banquet. The seats were propped up with cushions, the table was set with delightful food and table knives were put in place, one for each. When they were served with the course whereat they use the knives, she ordered him –Yusuf- to come into the room. When the women saw him they were overwhelmed with wonder and they marvelled at his exceptional good looks with profound admiration to the extent that they missed the fruit and wounded their hands. They exclaimed \" Allah forbid this is not a mortal; he is none other than a highly impressive, stately and distinguished angel","12:32":"There and then, she said to them: \"This is he on whose account you reproved me.\" \"I wanted him to fulfill my desire but he refused, and unless he submits to my command and does what I want, he shall be put in prison and be incensed with multiplied humiliations","12:33":"O Allah, my Creator,\" Said Yusuf, \"l would rather be imprisoned than submit to their evil desire; and unless O Allah, You keep their intrigues away from me, I may succumb to their temptation and be one of these wrongful of actions","12:34":"Allah responded to his invocation and kept their cunning away from him; He is indeed AL-Sami' (the Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and AL-'Alim (the Omniscient)","12:35":"But they -the men- thought it would be in the best interests of all concerned that he be put in prison for a while, albeit they saw all the signs confirming his innocence","12:36":"Along with Yusuf, two young men serving in the court were dismissed and put in prison. Each of them had a dream. One of them saw himself pressing grapes to make wine and the other saw himself carrying bread on his head and the birds were eating therefrom. Impressed by Yusuf's appearance which they thought was conformable to reason and piety, they asked him: \"Can you reveal to us the significance of these dreams! We do see you a man of piety and we see in you virtue in its true signification","12:37":"Rest assured\", he said, before food is brought to you, I will have informed you of the interpretation of your dreams. This is a part of the divine knowledge Allah, my Creator has imparted to me in consequence of conforming my will to His will. I have forsaken the system of faith of a people who deny Allah and refuse to acknowledge the truth of the Hereafter","12:38":"I followed the system of faith and worship of my fathers Ibrahim, Ishaq and Ya'qub. It was never befitting that we should incorporate with Allah other deities, this is His grace abounding in us and in mankind but most people are not impelled with the feeling of gratitude","12:39":"Fellow - inmates\", he said, \"do you honestly believe that such an immense universe could be controlled with such precision by a group of creatures diverse in kind, nature and character or by Allah AL-Wahid (the One and only) Who is AL- Qahhar (the Omnipotent, Absolute and Irresistible)","12:40":"In fact,\" he added, \"those whom you worship besides Him are but names of objects you and your fathers have designated as gods; a system of faith and worship Allah has never authorized. Indeed, decision, command and judgement are asserted as Allah's own, He ordained that you worship no one but Him. This is the right system of faith and worship but most people do not perceive this fact","12:41":"Fellow prisoners said Yusuf, \"Now, you shall have the interpretation of your dreams\": \"As to the fellow pressing grapes, he will be released and restored to his position and will serve his master -the king- with wine, whereas the other will be crucified and the vultures will prey upon his head. There, the die is cast concerning your enquiry","12:42":"Then said he to the inmate whom he thought would be released: \"Mention my name and my story, O fellow, to the king when you are in his presence.\" But in the midst of the court he -the servant- yielded to the lower part of his nature which is guided by AL-Shaytan and forgot to mention to the king the story of his fellow prisoner. By consequence, Yusuf remained in confinement for a few years - said to be not less than three years","12:43":"And for once said the king to his retinue: \"I saw in my dream seven fat cows eaten by seven lean and emaciated ones, and seven green ears of corn and seven others dry. Give me O counselors an opinion as it seems to you on that sense impression I had in my sleep if you are well versed in interpreting dreams","12:44":"These are nothing but confused dreams,\" they said, \"nor are we conversant with the interpretation of dreams","12:45":"There and then did Yusuf's fellow prisoner who heard of the king's dream remember in the end Yusuf and his story. He said: \"Permit me to withdraw and give me permission to go to where I can get you the right and true information","12:46":"He asked: \"Yusuf; O man of righteousness and truth, reveal to us this dream and what it prefigures: Seven fat cows were eaten by seven lean and emaciated ones, and seven green ears of corn together with seven dry ones.\" \" Give me your opinion so that I go back to the people and inform them of what they should expect","12:47":"Yusuf did not only tell him of what people should expect but also suggested the safe measures to be taken. He said: \"You shall sow the land in diligent labouring and when it is the season for reaping and gathering in the ripened grain, leave it in its ears and lay it up in store except a little which you will eat","12:48":"Following this episode, there shall come seven droughty years consuming all that you have saved except the little which you have to use for seed","12:49":"Then, there follows a year in which people shall rejoice at the abundance of rain and at the yield of grape-vines and other juicy and oily trees and they shall be busy pressing juices and extracting oils","12:50":"The king, now pleased, said: \"Bring him to me.\" When the king's messenger went to fetch him, Yusuf with just confidence, said to the messenger.: \"Go back to your master and ask him to re open my case and question the women who wounded their hands at the banquet and what did they have in mind to be up to trap! \"Allah, my creator is indeed fully aware of their cunning","12:51":"There and then did the king summon the women and question them. He asked: \"What was your purpose and intention when you tried to solicit Yusuf?\" They said: \"Allah forbid, we have never known him to be morally depraved\". The court official's wife, now being brought to her senses said: \"Now that the truth transpired, it was I who solicited him and he has indeed been telling the truth","12:52":"I declare the truth\", she added, \"so that he knows that I did not advantage myself of his absence and betray him or relate to him falsehood. Allah does not cause the cunning of the deceitful and the dishonest attain its end","12:53":"I'm not trying\", she said, \"to vindicate my wrong nor do I absolve myself of the guilt which resided in my intention. One's ego inclines one to propound evil except those who are graced with Allah's mercy, and Providence their guide; Allah, my Creator, is indeed Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)","12:54":"There and then did the king command that Yusuf be brought to him; he said: \"I will use him as my councillor and exclusively my own\". When Yusuf was granted audience with the king, the king said to him: \"You are now held precious in the realm's esteem and you are granted security and authority","12:55":"There, Yusuf said: \"Now, O king, that you have faith in me, then entrust ''me with the granaries and the storehouses of the agricultural and natural products of the land and with the treasuries of the realm, and you shall find me trustworthy and capable of guarding the interests of the kingdom and knowing how to manage and administer affairs cleverly","12:56":"Thus did We firmly establish Yusuf in the land where he could extend his power and jurisdiction wherever he willed. We bestow our mercy on whom We will and never do We annul, withhold or withdraw the fruit people are entitled to reap from deeds of wisdom and piety","12:57":"Moreover, the reward Hereafter shall be far better; it falls to those who recognized Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and constantly entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Him","12:58":"They went to the man in charge of the granaries -Yusuf- who knew them while they failed to recognize him","12:59":"He supplied them with their requirement of corn; he talked with them acting as if he did not know they had a half brother he said to them: \"So, you have a brother through your father. Bring him to me; do you not see that I dispense the measure to the full and that I afford welcome and extend the most generous hospitality to guests and visitors","12:60":"If you do not bring him,\" he added, \"I will deny you the provision of corn which you need, nor will you be allowed to come near me","12:61":"They said to him: \"we will talk his father into our cause and persuade him into sending him with us and rest assured that that we will certainly do","12:62":"There and then said Yusuf to his attendants who rendered the service: \"Put back their money -which they paid for the corn- into their saddle-bags; they may recognize it when they go back to their people and hopefully be encouraged to come back","12:63":"When they returned to their father, they said to him: \"O father we have been threatened with the denial of future corn-measures unless we be accompanied by our brother –Benjamin-, therefore, we beg you to send him with us so that we can get our supply of corn, and we solemnly promise to guard him home","12:64":"The father said: \"Shall I entrust him to you just as I entrusted his brother -Yusuf- to you before! Allah is He Who is the Tutelary Guardian and He is the most capable of extending mercy","12:65":"But when they unloaded and opened their bags, they found their money had been refunded to them and there, they said: \"Look O father, what more do we want! There is our money; it has been returned to us; we will provision our family, guard our brother and add a camel's load good at need; It is but a small quantity","12:66":"The father said: \"I will not send him –Benjamin- with you until you have given me a binding oath with a solemn appeal to Allah in witness that you shall bring him back to me unless you are surrounded ,,. Having made an oath to him, he said to them: \"There, shall Allah be our witness Who stands guard over what we discourse","12:67":"He -Ya'qub- in a word with grace divine imbued, advised his sons ,\" not to make entry through the same gate. He said to them: \" O my sons, do not all enter by the same gate but segregate yourselves from one another and enter by different gates. Not that I will deprecate a misfortune that Allah has meant to befall you, it is not in mortals to command success.\" \"Allah is He Who has the command; in Him do I trust and in Him must all the faithful put their trust","12:68":"Albeit they entered in the manner conformable to their father's advice, it did not mean that they would have escaped a misfortune decreed by Allah, but it was only a notion in Ya'qub's mind wherefore his reason was satisfied. He was imbued with divine knowledge We had imparted to him, but most people are not so imbued nor do they perceive this fact","12:69":"When they came to where Yusuf was, he took his full brother -Benjamin- by his side, and in a manner designed to escape observation, he declared to him his identity and actuated him with the feeling of confidence and said to him: \"Do not grieve at heart over what their minds and souls had impelled them to do","12:70":"When he was supplying them with their requirement of corn, the attendants, who were instructed earlier, put the king's cup in his brother Benjamin's saddle-bag. As all of them started to journey homeward, an announcer declared larceny; he said: \"O you travellers, you are thieves","12:71":"The brothers turned back and asked: \"What is it that you have lost","12:72":"The attendants said: \"We lost the king's cup, and we promise to reward whoever finds it a camel's load of corn\", and, said the foreman, \"I am, to this effect, the guarantor","12:73":"The brothers said: \"By Allah! you people know that we did not come here to cause mischief or create discord, nor are we disposed to such conduct","12:74":"The attendants said: \"What penalty then shall be incurred on him who is found guilty of theft if it be established that you are lying","12:75":"Being sure of their innocence-, the brothers said: \"He who is found guilty of theft shall have to pay for it or else be the property of the state, and it serves him right; for thus do we treat (in Jewish Can'an) the wrongful of actions","12:76":"He –Yusuf- began the search with their sacks before searching that of his brother -Benjamin-, then he brought it out of Benjamin's saddle bags. Thus did We design a stratagem for Yusuf to outwit his brothers according to the inspired plan. He could not have detained his brother -Benjamin- by exercising judicial authority not conformable to the statutes of the realm, nor could he have applied the Jewish law of full restitution for the theft or the enslavement by the state unless Allah had willed. So it was. We raise whom We will to higher ranks and exalt them in dignity, wisdom and power. Above every one having mastery of knowledge, there is one who is endowed with more substantial knowledge; and above every one whose sum of knowledge with grace divine imbued there is AL-'Alim (the All-Knowing, the Omniscient)","12:77":"There and then said the brothers, adding insult to injury: \"If he has appropriated dishonestly something belonging to someone else, a brother of his had committed theft aforetime.\" Yusuf swallowed his resentment and kept it down, and in words spoken aside he said: \"You went further and fared worse; it shall go bad with you here and worse Hereafter, and Allah knows every falsity you devise","12:78":"Yusuf said: \"O you noble one, he has a father who is carried through the stealing steps of age to advanced life. Take one of us in his stead, we do see you a man of piety and we see in you virtue in its true signification","12:79":"Allah forbid\", said Yusuf, \"that we should take to our custody but him with whom we found our personal property or else we will be wrongful of actions","12:80":"When they lost hope of pursuading him to change his position, they were reticent about their intentions wherefore they withdrew and conferred in secret: \"Do you not know\", said their eldest, \"or have you forgotten that your father has bound you by an oath with a solemn appeal to Allah! what of your sense of guilt of negligence and want of reasonable care which has bereaved our father of his son Yusuf. Therefore, I have resolved never to depart from hence until my father has permitted me to do so or Allah has determined me on a course of action; He gives the law whereas all other judges just interpret it","12:81":"Go back to your father\", he added, and say to him: your son -Benjamin- has committed a theft and we were associated with the event and we only relate what we saw with our own eyes; and when we bound ourselves by the vow, we did not indulge in prophecy to foretell future events or realize the unseen","12:82":"If you are in doubt of what we relate to you,\" they added, \"then you may send whom you trust to the city whereat we were, to inquire in the matter of the larceny, and you may also ask the people with whom we travelled, and rest assured that we are telling the truth and nothing but the truth","12:83":"Ya'qub said: \" Indeed your minds and souls have enticed you to do something evil and impelled you to feign this tale; may Allah bring them all back to me; He is indeed AL-'Alim and AL-Hakim (the Wise)","12:84":"He withdrew away from them and retired from their society, weeping and expressing his feeling of grief aroused by the loss of Yusuf. He said: \" what a pity it is to lose Yusuf! \" and he felt profound grief and mourned passionately to the extent that his eyes turned opaque and impenetrable to sight in the train of his mental pain and deep sorrow","12:85":"His sons said to him: \"For heaven's sake, shall you keep on recalling Yusuf to your memory with distressed mind and deep sorrow and weep out your eyes and heart until you are consumed by disease or perish in the wreck of sorrow","12:86":"I only exercise my mind in thought\", he said, \"and express my grief and deep sorrow to Allah, and I know from Allah what you my sons do not know","12:87":"My sons \" he added: \"go back to your older brother and feel all of you after Yusuf and his brother -Benjamin- and do not nurse despair nor give up hope of Allah's mercy. Indeed no one despairs of Allah's mercy but those who do not pin their faith to Him nor do they justify faith as a conviction operative on their character and will","12:88":"When the brothers went back and joined the eldest brother and were granted audience of the vizier –Yusuf-, they said to him, appealing to his charity: \"O noble one we and our family have had a severe touch of misfortunes and the famine has levied distress upon us, and we have brought the little we could afford in exchange for the corn we need. We seek your kindness and your benevolence for the alleviation of our mental and physical distress. We should be grateful indeed if you would give us the full measure of corn and consider the extra you add as charitable alms comforting the poor; blessed indeed is he that considers the poor, for Allah rewards the benevolent","12:89":"Yusuf then said: \"Do you recall what you did to Yusuf and his brother. You probably did not realize the danger and the consequence of what you were doing and you did it foolhardily","12:90":"They said: \"Indeed you are Yusuf, are you not!\" \"Indeed I am,\" said Yusuf, \"and this is my brother –Benjamin-. Allah has graced us with His divine favour and benediction, and conferred on us prosperity, for he who entertains the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and be unwearied in the face of difficulties and able to endure evil shall be greatly rewarded. Allah does not annul, withhold or withdraw the fruit people are entitled to reap from their deeds of wisdom and piety","12:91":"Goodness\", they said, \"indeed Allah has taken you by preference out of all of us and exalted you in status, rank and fortune and characterized you by impressive disposition.\" \"We do acknowledge our sinful deed and confess ourselves to Allah with full purpose of amendment of life","12:92":"Today\" said, Yusuf: \"I cannot blame you to weep, nor do I reproach you. To err is human, to forgive, divine.

We deliver whom We will and punish whom We will and never is Our retributive punishment averted from those who grow daily more and more wicked","12:111":"Indeed there has been an example or a great lesson in the narratives of the Messengers; a lesson lessoning those of intellect into abhorrence of impatience and despair and the abuse of divine faculties. Such narratives as have been disclosed by divine means are not a feigned tales, but an integral part of the Quran corroborating and authoritatively validating all the divine Books revealed before it in time and serving as an excellent interpretation expounding all the statutes and ordinances past and present revealed to all human beings exacting obedience from the whole.

Where the torrent flows, it drives before it unworthy matter and impurities floating on the surface gathering into a heap of froth resembling aptly the foamy admixture and impurities mounting to the surface of the heated ores for the separation of precious metals used for ornaments and other uses. Thus does Allah give examples with allegorical representations of truth and falsehood. As to the froth and the scum, they are rejected and disappear, whereas what is profitable to the people remains behind on earth.

They turn what they hear to ridicule albeit their nature or innermost being is attracted to the divine discourse. To keep their nobility and authority in the status quo, the wrongful of actions publicly declare, thus: \"You people\" they say, \"only follow a man who has witchcraft in his lips and you foolishly hang on to them","17:48":"See how they describe you O Muhammad in irrelevant similies reflecting deviation of mind and thought that they are unable to strike on the path of truth that guides into all truth","17:49":"They say in wonderment: \" Do you mean that after we have been reduced to bones and dust we shall be restored to life and be created anew","17:50":"Say to them: \"So be it, even if you were converted into stones or iron","17:51":"Or any other material you have in mind and you know it is beyond animation\" There and then they shall say: \"who will then restore us to life?\" Say to them: \"He who brought you into being and caused you to exist in the first creation\".

We only authorize the work of miracles so that the people be moved with a mingled feeling of dread and reverence toward Allah and realize the evil consequence of disobeying or denying Him","17:60":"And for once We told you O Muhammad that Allah, your Creator, surrounds all people on all sides -therefore declare Allah's message and do not be afraid ever-. We only made you see the vision of glory We presented to you in your night journey through the spiritual world to test the inclination of the people and their spiritual and moral attributes. The same purpose was also served by the accursed tree growing in the bottom of Hell to feed the sinners. We purposed that the infidels be moved with a mingled feeling of dread and veneration toward Allah and realize the evil consequence of disobeying and denying Him. But on the contrary, it only makes them sink deeper under the vexations of their minds, run riot and transgress the goal","17:61":"We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves to Adam in adoration\", and they prostrated to him in comely order, praise and admiration except Iblis AL- Shaytan-to-be who said: \"Shall I prostrate myself before him whom You created from clay","17:62":"And he added: \"Do you see that creature whom you treated with more honour than you treated me!\" \"If You grant me respite from death till The Day of Judgement, I will bridle his progeny, control them and misguide them excepting a few","17:63":"Reprieve is granted\", said Allah, \"wherefore you and those of them who follow you shall suffer the fatal consequence.

Indeed recital of the Quran at dawn is of great moment and a goodly loan. It inspires piety to the heart and makes the soul sensible of the presence of Allah; it is attended by the angels who witness its perusal","17:79":"And rouse up during the hours of the night to additional devotional exercise which is meritorious and adds to your credit; may Allah, your Creator, elevate you to a position of great honour, excellence and glory","17:80":"And call upon Allah in your invocatory prayer thus: \"O Allah, my Creator, may I ask You to make my entry upon the stage of life an entry by the gate of truth wherefore I stay my course in accordance with the divine standard.

There and then he said: \"I wish I had not incorporated with Allah, my Creator, other deities","18:43":"Nor did he have a co-operative group to afford him help besides Allah nor could he help himself","18:44":"There, it becomes evident that the only indisputable help and the only indisputable protection come only from Allah, the Omnipotent Who is truth personified, and the best Purveyor of divine rewards and the only Power that commands a successful end","18:45":"Express to them O Muhammad the likeness of life here, it stands similitude exact of a cycle in which a certain round of events or phenomena is completed, thus: We send down rain water from the floor of the vault of heaven; it mingles with the product of the soil which absorbs it and thrives thereby, then it eventually withers and dries up and gets dispersed with the wind, and Allah has always been Qadirun (Omnipotent) capable of doing all things","18:46":"Wealth and progeny feature the attraction and allurement exciting the pleasurable emotion of people in life here below, but what is infinite in future duration considered by Allah to have eternal consequences and hopeful reward are the deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety","18:47":"The Day shall come when We put or set the mountains in motion and you see the earth bare of the natural objects it once had, and We will have thronged them -all people- to judgement, leaving not one behind","18:48":"They shall be ranked before Allah in rows and be told: \"Now you have come back to Us as bare, open to view and unprotected as We created you in the beginning, yet you presumed earlier upon Providence and took for granted that We would not predetermine for you a point of time","18:49":"Now the Book of personal records is laid open to view and you shall see the sinful alarmed at its contents and excited with sudden fear and apprehension of danger. They express their thoughts in words, thus: \"Woe betide us. This book\", they say, \"does not leave out a minor or a major offense unrecorded\", and they shall find that every single deed, good or back is being presented and then they shall realize that Allah, your Creator, wrongs no one","18:50":"For once We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves to Adam in adoration, and the angels prostrated to Adam in comely order praise and admiration except Iblis, AL-Shaytan-to-be, who was a Jinn juxtaposed* to the angels and by consequence he disobeyed Allah, his Creator. So conditioned, do you people take him and his progeny as tutelary guardians besides Allah when they are your avowed enemy! Evil indeed is the substitute adopted by the wrongful of actions","18:51":"Never did I invite them -neither these nor those nor any creature- to be present, to spectate or to be associated with the event of the creation of the heavens and the earth nor of themselves -in reference to Adam- nor did I need help nor is it befitting. It is not Allah Who would use the help of others not to mention the wicked who mislead people","18:52":"The Day shall come when Allah says to the infidels: \"Call forth My partners whom you presumed to share My divine nature and Omnipotence\", and they shall do so, but their gods shall give back no answer, and We established between them - they and their gods- in life below the relationship leading to their final damnation","18:53":"And the wicked shall see Hell open to view and realize that they shall have to cast themselves head-long therein and that there is no escape","18:54":"And We have expounded and oriented Our revelations in this Quran to circumstances and requirements and We expressed many parables to bring the infidels to their senses but man has always been known to raise captions and frivolous objections about most things and tries to find fault unfairly and without good reason","18:55":"What kept people back from acknowledging and accepting the spirit of truth presented to them to guide them into all truth and inspire them to invoke their Creator's mercy and forgiveness but to rest content until they are wedded to the same calamities wedding those of old or to perceive through sense of sight the torment destined to be laid upon the damned","18:56":"We do not send the Messengers but to serve as spectacles and warnings, But the infidels try to seek everywhere vain proofs and groundless causes for which they are ready to contend to their life's end to refute the truth. They disdain indignantly to acknowledge My signs, My revelations and My warnings and laugh them to scorn","18:57":"And who is more wrongful of actions than he who has been reminded of Allah's evident signs and revelations and shuns them, forgetting what his unclean hands have committed! The fact is We enshrouded their hearts to preclude them from exercising intellectual power or understanding and struck them deaf that nothing that enages the intellect would come to their hearing. These are those whose hearts dare rise defiant against Allah. And if you invite them to accept the spirit of truth guiding into all truth, never shall they acknowledge Providence as their guide","18:58":"If Allah, your Creator. the Source of true forgiveness and divine mercy ,were to censure them for their demerits which are far above all praises of man, He would have hastened them to their painful end. But We have determined for them a point of time when they shall be reduced to a useless form and besides Allah they shall find no one to afford them refuge","18:59":"Such were the towns of old whose inhabitants We did away with when they proved themselves wrongful of actions and We determined the point of time at which We carried this punishment into effect","18:60":"For once did Mussa say to his attendant: \"l will not give up journeying until I have reached the concourse of the two seas -said to be he juncture of the Mediterranean and the red sea, or probably the two arms of the red sea- irrespective of how long it takes, be it a year, a decade or longer","18:61":"And when they had reached the junction of the two waters they forgot that they had carried a fish for their meal –Mussa was probably ordered to carry a fish-. The fish in a supernatural way, had stealthily found its way to the sea where it disappeared","18:62":"And when they had journeyed beyond that spot, unaware of the incident, Mussa said to his attendant \"It is time to eat; bring us our meal, we are exhausted; this journey has drained us of our strength","18:63":"Do you remember the rock\", asked the attendant, \"to which we resorted on the way\" \"I had forgotten all about the fish and this was a lapse of memory effectuated by AL-Shaytan who made me forget to mention it to you. It mysteriously found its way to the sea in a most astonishing manner","18:64":"This is exactly the place\" said Mussa, \"We were questing\", they went back retracing their footsteps","18:65":"There, they found one of Our devotees to whom We extended Our mercy and the initiation in mysteries and to whom We imparted of Our mystic knowledge what is transcending human comprehension","18:66":"Mussa asked him: \"May I follow you with the provision that you agree to impart to me of the knowledge imparted to you for the good of the wide circle of the all","18:67":"He -the teacher- said to Mussa: \"But you shall not be able to bear with me nor shall you quietly await the course of events","18:68":"And how could you\", he added, \"put up with something whose significance, import or intended purpose you do not know nor do you look at it with your inward sight","18:69":"But you will find me, Allah willing\", said Mussa, \"forbearing and will not disobey any of your instructions","18:70":"Therefore\", said the teacher \"if you should follow me, then do not look for the how and the why and the wherefore until I have given you an account of it","18:71":"And there, they made their way onward until they went on board ship in the bottom of which he -the teacher bore a hole for the purpose of sinking it-. There, did Mussa exclaim: \"Have you scuttled it to drown its passengers!\" \"You have indeed committed yourself to an evil line of conduct","18:72":"He -the teacher- said to Mussa: \"Did I not tell you, you would not be able to bear with me nor show forbearance with my actions","18:73":"My apologies\", said Mussa, \"please do not reproach me for my lapse of memory, nor impose on me an action hard to understand","18:74":"Again they made their way onward until they met a youth whom he killed. There and then Mussa exclaimed: \"Have you deprived an innocent soul of life when the youth committed no murder, you have indeed committed an act truly abominable","18:75":"The teacher said: \"Did I not tell you, you would not be able to bear with me nor show forbearance with my actions","18:76":"Indeed,\" said Mussa: a walking interrogation -point is never a pleasant companion, \"therefore if ever I should question anything you do from now on, then do not associate with me any longer; you have been patient enough to put up with my interrogation","18:77":"Again they made their way onward until they came across a town where they asked the people for food but the people neither offered nor afforded welcome or entertainment to strangers and consequently denied then hospitality. So they made their way onward only to find a wall about to fall and he -the teacher- repaired it and brought it back to its original state, and there Mussa exclaimed: \"Had you willed you could have charged a price for it","18:78":"Now\", said the teacher, \"is the turning-point; we break off and separate from each other, and now\", he added, \"I will give you the interpretation of all the events you were unable to forbear","18:79":"As to the boat\", said the teacher, \"it belonged to poor people –seamen- making a living, and I intended to make it defective to prevent their king, who pursues boat-owners, from capturing their boat","18:80":"As to the young man, –who was evil personified- his parents are righteous people and they would have, through affection and compassion, admitted of relaxation in Allah's system of faith and worship","18:81":"We decided\", -Allah decrees and I am the instrument- to replace him by another child who would be a symbol of faith and stands manifest of kindness and mercy","18:82":"As to the wall\", the teacher said, \"it constitutes a part of the property belonging to two orphan youngsters in the town and it rested directly on a treasure. Their father was a gracious man in whose heart reigned piety, and Allah, your Creator, has decreed that they reach maturity and dig out their treasure, an act of mercy vouchsafed by Allah, your Creator. You must realize that none of these incidents did I do of my own accord; there you have the interpretation of the incidents you could not forbear","18:83":"They ask you O Muhammad about the Bi-horned, Zul-Qarnain! Say to them: \"I will give you an account of his actions and the occurrences constituting his history in which he equally excelled","18:84":"Allah says: \"We confirmed him on earth and We imparted to him the knowledge of the ways and means serving a purposeful end","18:85":"And he purposefully lead the way","18:86":"He took the lead in an expedition toward he west until he reached a body of water -said to be the Atlantic Ocean, or more likely a mirky land abounding in swamps– where -he thought when viewing the horizon- the sun sets and where he found a -disorderly and unruly- people over whom We gave him authority. We left to him the manner of dealing with them. Either you punish them, We said or show them kindness","18:87":"He set up his constitution -in the occupied territories- and accordingly he stated: \"We will punish the wrongful of actions here and he wilt be left to Allah, his Creator, to impose upon him the torment laid upon the damned Hereafter","18:88":"Whereas he whose heart reflects the image of religious and , spiritual virtues and his deeds wisdom and piety will be rewarded with what is best and we will treat him kindly and impose on him what he can bear with ease and what sets his mind at rest","18:89":"Again, he purposefully lead the way","18:90":"He conducted an expedition eastward where the sun rises until he reached an open territory -probably a desert- where -he thought when viewing the horizon- the sun rises and where the people -who were primitive- had no covering besides the sun","18:91":"For thus We knew his thoughts and feelings as well as his mode of action","18:92":"Again he purposefully lead the way","18:93":"Until he reached a stretch of territory towered by two barriers -probably mountains- beneath which he found a people who could hardly understand a foreign word or language","18:94":"They said to him -through interpreters-: \"O you Zul- Qarnain, the tribes of Gog and Magog* are people who have both mischief and ill-will in their composition and they spread discord in the land. May we apportion to you a tribute in payment of raising a rampart between us, a rampart that would be invincible against all assaults","18:95":"He said: \"what Allah has bestowed on me of wealth and power far excels your tribute. You just help me with your laborious attempt and strenuous exertion of power and I will erect a barrier between you","18:96":"Bring me blocks or sheets of iron\", he said, \"to fill up the space between the two natural barriers\", then he said to them \"Now you may subject it to fire and use your bellows to make it red hot, and when it softened he asked them for molten brass to pour on the iron to weld in solid mass","18:97":"In consequence, they -the tribes- could not escalade it nor were they able to make their way through it by digging","18:98":"At the end\", Zul-Qarnain said thankfully: \"This is a mercy graciously vouchsafed by Allah, my Creator, and when Allah's predetermined point of time comes to pass, He shall turn it to dust. The promise of Allah, my Creator, has always been the truth personified","18:99":"And on the Day when the promise is fulfilled, we will leave them -the people- in an undulating conformation until the trumpet is sounded and then We assemble them all together in throngs","18:100":"There and then We will bring Hell in view near enough as to be clearly seen by the infidels","18:101":"Whose bodily eyes and their minds' eyes were veiled. from apprehension, knowledge or perception of My divine nature and My Omnipotence and Authority and from My signs and veritable revelations; they counselled deaf and were unwilling to open their hearts' ears","18:102":"Do they -the infidels- think they do better by taking My servants as their tutelary guardians besides Me! Indeed We have prepared Hell and made it ready for the abode of the infidels whom it asserts as its own","18:103":"Say to the infidels O Muhammad \"shall We tell you who they are whose deeds in life have lost them the most","18:104":"They are those who presumed upon Providence and conducted themselves in life according to false concepts and they thought they were doing what is right","18:105":"It is these who have denied the truth of their Creator's signs and counselled deaf to His spirit of truth guiding into all truth and to His promise of Judgment at Resurrection. In consequence their hopes shall be doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness, and in Day of Judgement We will attach to them no importance nor shall their pleading be of weight","18:106":"These are the ill-fated who justly deserve the abode in Hell by reason of their infidelity and disobedience and by consequence of laughing My revelations and signs and My Messengers to scorn","18:107":"But those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety shall be the recipients of Allah's mercy and blessings. We have prepared for them the Paradise which is furnished with trellised vines and fruit trees","18:108":"Wherein they would have passed through nature to Eternity admitting of no change","18:109":"Say to them –the people- \"If the vast body of water on the surface of the globe were ink serving the purpose of committing my Creator's words to writing, sooner would the vast body of water -now ink- be exhausted than would the words of my Creator even if we make this immense expanse twice as much","18:110":"Say to them O Muhammad: \"I am only a mortal like you, but I am prompted by Allah to impart to you the knowledge inspired to me.

The pagans labelled the Quran as poetry and the Prophet as a poet while the difference is obviously vast. A. The Quran invites to a straight course aiming at a specific Purpose and a useful end. The Prophet's words together with his deeds accord, he does not say something today and cancels it tomorrow nor does he yield to emotions and desires but insists on a divine course of action and does not change nor deviate. On the other hand poets are captives of their emotions, their imagination and of the changing atmospheres and temperaments. When pleased they say one thing and when displeased they say another thing, whereas the Quran adheres eternally to the same thing. B. Poets may be good poets (poets of literary merit), poetic antiquarian (poet with another quality), poeticule (insignificant ), poetaster (a writer of trashy verse) a rhymester. Some of them engage in feigning and devising fables and others aim to please. C.

No, but their doubt stands as the beacon of the unwise, in fact, their notion of the Hereafter has fallen on the blind spot","27:67":"And yet the infidels still say: \"Do you mean that after we and our fathers have been reduced to dust, we; can be resurrected","27:68":"We\" they add, \"have been promised that before and so have our fathers; this is indeed nothing but fables of old","27:69":"Say to them O Muhammad: \"Journey the land and open your minds' eyes to see for yourselves the fatal consequence which united all those who persisted in crime","27:70":"And do not be grieved at heart for their denial of the divine message nor for their hearts which dare rise defiant against Allah, nor should you be sorely distressed on account of their cunning which they take for a sinister and crooked wisdom","27:71":"And in their challenge to the occurrence of punishment they say: \" When will that promised punishment come to pass if indeed you are declaring the truth","27:72":"Say to them O Muhammad: \"It is hoped that some of what you have been promised and wish it be hastened on may overtake you now","27:73":"Indeed, the grace of Allah, your Creator, abounds in people but most of them show indisposition to acknowledge His bounty and display want of gratitude","27:74":"Allah, your Creator is Omniscient indeed of all that is reposited in their breasts of private thoughts and feelings and of all that they conceal and He is Alimun of all that they reveal","27:75":"And nothing of the unknown, the unseen or the hidden in the heavens or on earth but is recorded in the archetypal book","27:76":"Indeed this Quran tells the Children of Israel plenty, and informs them of the truth of most of the subject matter which set them at variance","27:77":"It is the spirit of truth guiding them into all truth and a mercy to those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues","27:78":"Allah, your Creator, shall judge between them in Day of Judgement with justice and equity; He is AL-Aziz and AL-'Alim","27:79":"And so, put O Muhammad your trust in Allah. You are in the right and you act in accordance with what is just and good, equitable and morally fitting","27:80":"But you shall not be able to make your voice reach the spiritually dead nor shall you be able to make it reach the worthless who counsel deaf nor do they open their hearts' ears when they turn their backs","27:81":"Nor shall you be able to guide those who lack intellectual or spiritual perception and their minds' eyes are blind nor can you extricate them or disengage out of the entangled wood of error. You can only influence those who listen to you and give credence to Our revelations and to Our authoritative divine signs with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, for such persons have indeed conformed to Islam","27:82":"And when time is propitious for Allah's predetermined special occasion to come to pass and they-the infidels - come to meet with their destiny, We introduce to them a beast from the earth to discourse with them and say to them: \"The infidels had always denied Allah's revelations and authoritative signs. What do you think of the signs now","27:83":"The Day shall come when We throng from every nation a group of those Who rejected Our message and denied Our authoritative divine signs. They shall be driven ahead like herds one flock behind the other","27:84":"Until they have all assembled before Him for judgement. Then shall He question them \"Did you not deny My revelations and authoritative divine signs when you did know their significance! What was it you were doing and what was it you had in mind","27:85":"And now that what was predicted and destined to happen as a reaction to their iniquities has come to pass, they are stricken dumb unable to put forward a plea neither in abatement nor in bar of an action or prosecution","27:86":"Did they not see that We designated for them a period of darkness - the night- to take their natural repose and recuperate*, and a period filled with light -the day- to have clear perception of things and acquire experience of the activities of human existence! phenomena emblematic indeed of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority that are appreciated and faithfully recognized by people who bow down their ears to the truth","27:87":"The Day shall come when the trumpet is sounded indicative of Resurrection and Judgement, and there shall all those in the heavens and all those on earth be shocked with startling intense horror except those whom Allah shall exempt as He will and all shall be brought before Him in low submissive reverence and humility","27:88":"And you see the mountains you think they are motionless while in fact they move as fast as the clouds -when driven by the wind","27:89":"He who crowns his deed with equity and good will shall advantage himself of the profit accruing therefrom and shall be exempt from the shocking occasion of the exciting intense horror, feeling safe and secure","27:90":"And he who crowns his deed with inequity and or iniquity shall be cast in Hell headlong with his damnable face downward, and be told: \"Are you not requited but with what is commensurate with your deeds","27:91":"Say to them O Muhammad: \"I have been commanded to worship and serve Allah, The Creator and the Supreme Master of this town -Macca- which He rendered sacrosanct and to Whom belong the whole and all in all, and I have been commanded to be one of those who have conformed to Islam","27:92":"Also to recite the Quran to be meaningful to the people\". Then he who is steered by the spirit of truth into all truth and Providence is his guide benefits his own soul and he who errs and strays from the path of righteousness, you just say to him O Muhammad: \"I am only a spectacle and a warning","27:93":"And say to them: \"Praise be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes, He shall exhibit to you His authoritative divine signs and His marvels which you shall inevitably recognize. Allah, your Creator, is not unmindful nor is He oblivious of all that you do","28:1":"(Tah), S. (Seen), M. (Meem) the Sarah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated","28:2":"These are divinely discoursed verses flowing with the precision and grace symbolic of the Book -the Quran- which is the spirit of truth that guides into all truth","28:3":"Here, We narrate to you O Muhammad in truth some information relative to Mussa and Pharaoh to relate it to the people whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues","28:4":"Pharaoh installed himself in the land in the office of dignity and tyranny, and divided the people into parties and leaned heavily against one of them, brutally slaughtering their new born males and purposely sparing their females. He was indeed mischievous creating diversity and discord","28:5":"And We decided to be kind and gracious to those who were suppressed and subdued in the land and to change their status and bring it into that of spiritual leadership intended to lead and inherit the land","28:6":"We decided to confirm and establish them firmly in the land and confront Pharaoh and Haman and their troops with what they feared might happen to them at their hands, the hands of Mussa whom they reared and the Israelites who followed his law","28:7":"We inspired Mussa's mother, thus: \"Breast feed him until you feel that fear falls upon you for his life, then put him in a chest and cast him into the river and do not be afraid nor grieve at heart. We will restore him to you and confer on him the prerogative of Apostleship","28:8":"The waves swept him ashore and there, he was picked up by the family and the household of the Pharaoh who did not realize that he would be their avowed enemy who would cause them limitless misery and endless grief. Pharaoh, Haman and their troops were indeed transgressors against the principle of good and were sinful offenders against Allah","28:9":"And there, Pharaoh's wife said to Pharaoh as she saw the child: \"a comfort and joy to the eye, he will make my eyes and yours speak content\". She gave orders to the guards: \"do not kill him. He might be of some quality that brings about good or advantage and he might be helpful in effecting a purpose or we might adopt him as a son. She was totally unaware of what the future held","28:10":"Meanwhile, Mussa's mother was left with an unsatisfied feeling and with a heart experiencing an aching void the world could not fill, she almost betrayed him had We not emboldened her heart to fall in line with those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues","28:11":"She -the mother- said to his sister: \"Search for him and keep track\" And his sister saw him at a distance and she controlled her emotions and kept a state of indifference so that Phraoh's people would not recognize the relationship","28:12":"And We had already made him reject and refuse breast feeding from all the women who were available to suckle and nurse a strange child. So conditioned, his sister suggested to Pharaoh's household a solution, she said: \"Shall I tell you of a family who would rear him and take good care of him for you","28:13":"And there, did We restore him to his mother so that she would be delighted and her eyes speak content and she would take off the robe of grief and realize that the promise of Allah is an absolute certainty even though most people are indeed ignorant of this very fact","28:14":"And when he -Mussa- reached maturity and was capable of fulfilling the obligation and the trust, We bestowed on him an exalted position. We imparted to him wisdom and divine knowledge. Thus do We requite those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety","28:15":"He entered the city unnoted by its people (who might have retired for the siesta or the night) only to find two men fighting, one of the same law and the other of his foes-an Egyptian: His co-religionist sought his help against their enemy and there Mussa cuffed him with the fists and the man dropped dead. There and then said Mussa: \"This is indeed a Satanic incitement, for this is the work of AL-Shaytan (Satan) who is an avowed enemy instigating deviation from the path of righteousness","28:16":"And he invoked Allah's mercy and forgiveness: \"O Allah, my Creator, he prayed: \"I have wronged my own soul. Forgive me O Allah and have mercy on me.\" Allah forgave him and extended to him His mercy; He is AL-Ghafur (the Forgiving), and AL-Rahim (The Merciful)","28:17":"And he added: \"O Allah, my Creator, since You have been gracious to me I promise I will never be a help to those who are disposed to the practice of evil","28:18":"From then on he came to be apprehensive of impending danger expecting at any moment to be arrested and prosecuted and either tortured or killed. And in this state of anxiety and fear he met his same co-religionist whom he had helped the day before crying for his help today. Mussa said to Him: \"You are indeed quarrelsome and alienated from Allah","28:19":"Nevertheless, he felt like attacking the man who was their enemy but in making the attempt the man said to him: \"Do you wish O Mussa to kill me as you killed a man yesterday?\" \"You seem to be eager to exercise power and to play the tyrant in the land and not to brew reform","28:20":"Meantime there came a man from the far end of the city. He said to Mussa: \"The chiefs are convening to deliberate upon killing you, therefore you had better leave the city. I hope you do realize that I am offering you a sincere advice","28:21":"Mussa took the man's advice and left the city in a state of anxiety and fear expecting to be seized with a calamity at any moment. Feeling helpless he invoked Allah for help, thus: \"Protect me O Allah, my Creator. and save me from the people who are wrongful of actions","28:22":"Journeying toward Madyan he said to himself: \"Perhaps Allah, my Creator will guide me out of this fearful country into the path of truth and safety","28:23":"And as he arrived at the spring waters of Madyan he found a large crowd of people watering their flocks. Among them he found two women trying to keep back their flocks. He asked them: \"What is your trouble?\"; \"we cannot water our flocks\", they said, \"until the shepherds have driven off their flocks and our father is quite an old man","28:24":"Mussa watered for them their flocks then assumed a place in the shade and prayed: \"O Allah, my Creator,\" \"with all Your grace that abounds in me I am indigent and-lonely","28:25":"Unexpectedly, there came back one of the two women walking with a womanly propriety of behaviour, chastity of thought, speech and conduct. She said to him: \"My father invites you to requite you for the service you rendered to us, watering our flocks\". And when he went and met with the father and told him his story, the father said to him: \"Do not be afraid, you have already gotten off safely and escaped from the people who are wrongful of actions","28:26":"And there, said one of the women to her father: \"Would you hire him O father, for the best you can hire is the reliable man who is rather strong and worthy of trust","28:27":"The father said to Mussa: \"I wish to offer you one of my daughters in matrimonial union on contrition that you serve me for eight years and should you like to add two more years to make them ten, it will be of your own accord\". \"I do not wish,\" he added, \"to make things difficult for you and you will find me, Allah willing, one of these in whose hearts reigns piety","28:28":"This\", he added, \"is an agreement between me and you, whichever of the two terms be fulfilled, there shall be no injustice or ill-will to me and Allah is a Witness to our binding agreement","28:29":"And when Mussa had fulfilled the term agreed upon and departed with his family he perceived a fire on the mountain side of Tur (Tor) He said to his family: \"I have just perceived a fire, you stay here. Perhaps I might be able to get some information relative to the direction We pursue or fetch you a brand from the burning wood to kindle a fire to warm you up","28:30":"And when he reached the destined spot he was called to from the tree on the right side of the valley at the sacred ground, thus: \"O Mussa\", he was prompted, \"It is I, Allah, Creator of the worlds, the visible and the invisible, past, present and those to come","28:31":"Drop your staff\", Allah said to him. When he -Mussa- saw it moving as though it were a serpent personified he withdrew in the face of danger and did not return. \"Come back O Mussa\", he was prompted \"and do not be afraid. You are indeed one of those who enjoy safety","28:32":"Put your hand\", He was told, \"into your bosom and it shall come out transfigured in a radiance of white divine light unharmed and all sound, and draw your hand to your side to put off the robe of fear\". \"These are two divine signs evincing both My Omnipotence and Authority to present to Pharaoh and his peers, for they have been a people who confirmed themselves in the horrid purpose and the ill-intention","28:33":"And there said Mussa: \"O Allah, my Creator, I killed one of them and I fear they might kill me","28:34":"My brother Harun (Aaron) expresses himself much better than I and he possesses the power of fluent, forcible and appropriate expression. Send him O Allah with me to be a support and to confirm my cause, for I fear they might accuse me of falsehood","28:35":"Allah said: \"We will strengthen you by a main stay, your brother Harun, who will be your right arm and We will impart to you divine power and authority so that they shall not be able to apply themselves ever to that degree which is level with your delegated capacities. Victory shall sit on your helm, you and your brother, and the helm of all those who fall in line with you","28:36":"And when Mussa presented to them Our convincing divine signs with distinct apprehension of all that they involve, they said: \"This is indeed nothing but witchcraft fabricated for deception. We never heard of such things discussed by our fathers","28:37":"It is only Allah,\" said Mussa, \"Who knows those whom He sent with the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and He knows those who are destined to win the bliss Hereafter when the wrongful of actions shall not find one single instance of physical or spiritual prosperity","28:38":"And here addressed Pharaoh his peers: \"O you peers of the realm\", he said, \"I never knew an Ilah to whom you pay reverence and veneration but myself. Therefore, bake for me O Haman -his grand vizier- the moulded bricks of clay with fire and erect for me a lofty building soaring skyward, I might find the means of mounting to the Ilah of Mussa whom I deem a great liar","28:39":"And there did Pharaoh and his hosts turn indignant and unjustly displayed in the land inordinate self-esteem and extravagance in their accounts of themselves and had a notion in their minds that never shall they be brought back to Us","28:40":"And by consequence We surrounded him and his troops and cast them into the sea and you can see the fatal consequence of the wrongful of actions","28:41":"And We justly incited them to compete for superiority in iniquities and be the leaders thereof, an attribute that led them and those who fell in line with them directly to Hell and no help whatever shall they receive in Day of Judgement","28:42":"And We glued them a curse here and with disgrace Hereafter when they shall be viewed with contempt","28:43":"And after We had reduced the earlier generations to a useless form We gave Mussa the Book AL-Tawrah (the Torah) to serve as a divine evidence engaging the intellect and a spirit of truth guiding into all truth and a mercy extended by Allah so that they may hopefully lift to Him their inward sight and keep Him in mind","28:44":"You Muhammad were not at the western side of Mount Tur at the time We imparted to Mussa the divine knowledge and entrusted him with the Book and empowered him to do the intended duty nor were you a witness of the event","28:45":"Not only that, but since then We have raised up generations over the years and it is an age since then that people have forgotten the covenants they ratified. Nor did you live among the Madyanites -of Madyan- to narrate to your people their stories and events with such precision! But We sent you and We imparted to you the informative knowledge","28:46":"Nor were you at the side of the Mount when We called to Mussa, but it is the mercy of Allah extended to you to serve as a spectacle and a warning to a people who never received a spectacle and a warning before you, that they may hopefully ponder","28:47":"Had We not sent you O Muhammad to the people in general and to the Pagans in particular to serve as a spectacle and a warning they would have said when befallen with a misfortune as a reaction to what their wrongful and unclean hands have committed: \"O Allah, our Creator, if only You had sent to us a Messenger to guide us to Your path in which Your divine signs shine like beacons inciting us to lift to You our inward sight","28:48":"And now when they have received Our spirit of truth guiding into all truth they say: \"If only he -the Messenger- were given divine signs similar to those given to Mussa!\" Did they not reject the signs We equipped Mussa with before! and did they not label both AL-Tawrah of Mussa and the Quran as presentations of falsehood and designated them two related subjects complementing one another on the work of magic and they said: \"We simply deny and reject each and all","28:49":"Say to them O Muhammad: \"If indeed you are declaring the truth then try to bring down from the realm of heaven a better book that you consider to be the truth that guides into all truth and I will be happy to follow it","28:50":"And if such an undertaking they fail to fulfill (and fail they undoubtedly will) then you will realize O Muhammad that they simply follow their own wishes and that they act upon their own desires. And who is more perverse than him who yields to his own imagination not based upon reason nor upon divine guidance! Allah does not guide the wrongful of actions","28:51":"We have already imparted to them the divine knowledge to guide then into all truth that they may hopefully lift to Allah their inward sight and keep Him in mind","28:52":"And those to whom We gave the Book before this Book -the Jews and the Christians- do acknowledge the Quran and the truth of your divine mission","28:53":"When it is recited to them they express their thoughts in words. They say: \"We do acknowledge Allah's divine discourse represented in the Quran for it reflects the divine truth notwithstanding that long before the Quran We conformed to Islam","28:54":"Such persons shall be requited in double, for their suffering and for enduring pain and hostilities, for their constancy in labour, exertion and effort and for their forbearance under provocation. They repel pride with prudence and evil with good and they spend in benevolence and benefaction of the provisions of life We provisioned them","28:55":"These are they who do not pervert their senses. When they hear idle talk gossip or slander they refrain from listening and turn away and say to the profaners: \"We are responsible for our deeds and you are response for yours; peace be upon you. We are not interested in the ignorant who have no shame of their sins","28:56":"You Muhammad shall not be able to guide to Allah's path whom you like or to whom you have special affection* but Allah guides to His path of righteousness whom He will and He knows best those who are willing to lift to Him their inward sight","28:57":"And they -the infidels- say to you: \" Should we fall in line with you and follow your exhortation we will be ousted from our land and be robbed of our rights and privileges!\" Did We not confirm to them on a secure basis a safe and sacred Sanctuary secured by religious sentiments and reverence against violation, infringement or encroachment. We caused the flow of all kinds of fruits and the products of everything to its environ; a livelihood provided by Us albeit most of them are ignorant of this fact","28:58":"How many towns did We reduce to a useless form after Our grace was made to abound in them and they met it with dissatisfaction and ingratitude! There you can see how their dwellings were left desolate thereafter and destitute of inhabitants but of a few and We were the inheritors","28:59":"And never did Allah, your Creator, reduce the towns to a useless form until He had sent a Messenger to their capital to recite to the people Our divine revelations but they closed their hearts' ears. Therefore, never did We reduce the towns to a useless form except when the fundamental truth failed to govern their thoughts and they proved themselves wrongful of actions","28:60":"You people had better realize that whatever you have been granted of material advantages is simply the evanescent enjoyments of life and its temporal and mundane things, whereas all that is in heaven's realm affords eternal beatitude and surpassing pleasure. Have you people no sense","28:61":"You people just think and think but this: Does he whom We promised Our efficacious grace and who found that it has effected the end for which it was given compare with him whom We graced with the material advantages of life here and then he finds himself among those indicted Hereafter","28:62":"There shall come the Day when they have much to answer for. There and then shall Allah ask them \"Where are My partners whom you incorporated with Me, whom you assumed they shared My divine nature","28:63":"And there, those whose destiny as losers has been fulfilled shall say: \"O Allah, our Creator\", \"it is these whom we led astray and caused to deviate in mind\" \"We caused them to deviate in purpose as we deviated in mind. We repudiate them and denounce them in Your August presence. In fact it was not us they really worshipped","28:64":"And they -the followers- shall be told: \"Call to your predominant partners, and they will, but no answer shall they receive therefrom and they shall all wish they had pursued the path of righteousness, the path of Allah","28:65":"This is the Day when Allah shall call them in question and call them to render an account, thus: \"What kind of response did you give to the Messengers","28:66":"But all information and news shall be eclipsed to them and their lack in intellectual and spiritual perception shall reduce them to silence and repress any expression of feeling, that they admit no discourse","28:67":"However, he who in lowliest plight repentant stood and acknowledged Allah's Supremacy, Omnipotence and Authority and whose deeds were impressed with wisdom and piety might be among those who succeed in inviting Allah's mercy and forgiveness","28:68":"And Allah, your Creator, creates what He will and chooses what He will and whom He will whereas they -the infidels- and people at large cannot impose on Allah their choice in any matter irrespective of its nature and consequently they have no choice. Glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely beyond all they incorporate with Him","28:69":"And Allah, your Creator, is Omniscient indeed of all that is reposited in their bosoms of private thoughts and feelings and of all that they conceal and He is ALimun of all that they reveal","28:70":"And He is Allah, there is no Ilah but Him. Praise be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes here and Hereafter. To Him belong the rule, the government, the reign, the influence, the supreme authority, the decision and the indictment. Supremacy is His attribute and to Him shall all of you be brought back","28:71":"Say to them O Muhammad: \"What if Allah cancels -to your detriment- daylight and extends the night to the Day of Judgement!\" \"Who is the Ilah besides Him who will be able to restore for you daylight?\" Will you people not deviate into sense and open your hearts' ears","28:72":"Say to them: \"What if Allah cancels the night and extends daylight to the Day of Judgement, who is the Allah besides Him who will be able to restore for you the night in which you repose! Will you not open your minds' eyes","28:73":"But in mercy to you people He caused the night and the day to vary in duration and undergo constant alternation and successions* that you take your natural repose and recuperate** and be able to accomplish your objects sought after of His bounty to the end that your bosoms may hopefully surge forth and answer thanks","28:74":"The Day shall come when He questions the infidels. He shall ask them: \"Where are My partners whom you presumed they shared My divine nature and authority","28:75":"And We will call to witness one from each nation (the Messenger) to give evidence in relation to the worldly matters and We will question the infidels- as to their proof of the validity of their gods whom they had incorporated with Allah! But they shall fail to advance any proof and they shall realize that Allah alone is and has always been the Truth personified. Here and now they are renounced and forsaken by those whom they presumed to share with Him His divine nature and supremacy; they have failed their expectations","28:76":"Qarun was a Hebrew of the people of Mussa (possibly a cousin), one who exercised iniquity and injustice toward his people. We made all grace abound in him. We bestowed on him such immense treasures that the keys (of the chambers where the treasures were hidden) would have been an immense burden for a host of strong men to carry (were a burden for three hundred mules). His people said to him: \"Do not rejoice boastingly, for Allah does not like those who boast` vaingloriously of what they are made to possess","28:77":"And betake yourself\", they added, \"to Providence for the grace He made to abound in you seeking His satisfaction -to ensure spiritual relish- Hereafter, and do not neglect your share of worldly enjoyment of what is lawful, And be kindly disposed and benevolent to others as Allah has been to you and do not pursue mischief nor create discord on earth. Allah detests those who have ill- will and mischief is natural to them","28:78":"But -Qarun- said: \"I have acquired what came into my possession by reason of the knowledge inherent in me and for my intellectual acquaintance with fact\". Did he not know that Allah had reduced to a useless form before him people who were stronger and greater in affluence! However, there is no need to question those who had been steeped in crime","28:79":"And so he came out before his people in a splendid procession conducting himself pompously, and there exclaimed those who were absorbed m the vanities of this wicked world: \"we wish\", they said, \"we were given the like of the riches Qarun was made to possess. He is indeed fortunate","28:80":"Whereas those gifted with divine and spiritual knowledge exclaimed: \"Woe betide you -people of vanities-\",\"the reward conferred by Allah Hereafter is infinitely better for those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety, a status attained only by the patient who exercise forbearance under provocation, bear with others their faults and limitations and sit like patience on a monument smiling at grief","28:81":"And to set him -Qarun- as a deterrent, We eclipsed him and his splendour, his wealth and his house in one swallow by the yawning earthly gulf We created by quaking the earth beneath him and his house and He had no supporters to defend him from Allah nor was he able to protect himself","28:82":"And those who had desiderated his status the day before exclaimed then: \"Goodness, it is evident that Allah gives livelihood generously and confers support gratuitously to whom He will of His servants and He gives with restraint and by measure to whom He will. Has He not been gracious and merciful to us\". they added, \"He would have made the earth take us into itself. Goodness, if is evident that those who challenge Allah do not really prosper","28:83":"That home, in the world to come where one's true affections and hopes centre and where one finds peace, rest, refuge, beatitude and bliss, we simply reserve for those who do not seek to attain a high status in the land in order to impose themselves on people and to play the tyrant nor do they play the mischief or create discord. A happy ending is an attribute to those in whose hearts reigns piety","28:84":"He who crowns the deed with equity shall be rewarded with what is infinitely better than what is commensurate with his deed and those who commit themselves to an evil line of conduct, shall be requited only with what is commensurate with their deeds","28:85":"He Who imposed on you the Quran O Muhammad -which brought on you persecution and led you to go hence- shall cause you to return. Say to them: \"Indeed Allah, my Creator, knows best who proclaims the spirit of truth that guides into all truth and who deviates from sense and be lest in the maze of error","28:86":"You O Muhammad never expected the Book -the Quran- to be sent down and to be revealed to you but it was only Allah's mercy extended to you.

He starts creation and reproduces it, a process quite easy for him to perpetuate","29:20":"Say to them -the pagans -\"Journey the land and open your minds' eyes to see how he generated creation and it is Allah who shall originate the last creation -Resurrection.

Such persons lack spiritual connection between their hearts and minds and Allah; they live without expectation of a spiritual desire and Allah alludes to them, thus\": \"These are they who have despaired of My mercy and shall suffer the torment laid upon the damned","29:24":"And what was the answer of Ibrahim's people to his admonition and exhortation but to decide to get rid of him, they said: \"Kill him or burn him\" but Allah saved him and delivered him from the fire whole and all sound. This is indeed emblematic of Almightiness; food for thought that is taken by those who prostrate their reason to divine revelation","29:25":"There and then said Ibrahim: \"You people have dedicated your affectionate devotion in this world to idols besides Allah and in Day of Judgement shall all of you deny and reject each other and curse one another and be destined to make your eternal abode in Hell and there, no one can afford you help or protection","29:26":"And it was only Lut who acknowledged him and accepted his message and said: \"My heart, my mind and my soul as of now do quit the world of disbelief and emigrate to the world of truth and belief and as of now do I dedicate my affectionate devotion to Allah, my Creator, to Whom I betake myself, for He is AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hakim (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)","29:27":"And We bestowed on Ibrahim Ishaq (Isaac) and Yaqub (Jacob) and conferred on his progeny the prerogative of Prophethood and We entrusted them with the Book and We graced him with his due here and among the virtuous he shall be Hereafter","29:28":"And Lut whom We blessed, said to his people: \"You people do commit such an immorality as is contrary to the general inherent character and moral constitution and a vice that has never been practiced by any creature before","29:29":"You certainly have sensuous desire for men,\" he added, with whom you practice Sodomy and you commit highway robberies and you force people to immorality and in your society you commit abomination. And what was the response of his people. but to say: \" we defy you to precipitate Allah's retributive punishment if indeed you are declaring the truth","29:30":"And there, did Lut pray: \" O Allah, my Creator afford me help and give me victory over these people who are steeped in mischief and in crime","29:31":"And when Our Messengers -The angels- visited Ibrahim and intimated to him the joyful tidings (of the birth of a son in that advanced age) they said to him; \"we will be reducing this town and its inhabitants to a useless form, they have been wrongful of actions","29:32":"He -Ibrahim- said: \"But among its inhabitants dwells Lut.\" They said: \"we know exactly who lives there and we will deliver him and his family to safety excepting his wife who has been destined to remain behind -to meet with the same fate of the wicked","29:33":"And when Our Messengers went to Lut he came to grief on their account, and their safety was beyond his power.

He succeeded in blinding their eyes to the path of righteousness and led them by the nose to their loss in the maze of error, notwithstanding their intellect, for they were people who possessed enough intelligence","29:39":"Similarly reacted Qarun, Pharaoh and his grand vizier Haman when Mussa was sent to them and presented them with clear and plain revelations and signs guiding out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment. But they displayed inordinate self-esteem and extravagance in their accounts of themselves. nevertheless, they did not escape Our notice and consequently Our retributive punishment","29:40":"Each one of them did We penalize with what was commensurate with his evil deed. Among them were those against whom We sent a whirlwind and sand dunes and those who were overtaken by a merciless blast and those whom We eclipsed in one swallow by the yawning chasm We created beneath them and among them were those whom We drowned. And never was it Allah's attribute to do them injustice but it was they who wronged themselves","29:41":"The like of those who take tutelary guardians or protectors besides Allah stands similitude exact of the spider which seeks protection in a house made of slender filaments or threads spun all round. It may be strong enough to suit its purpose, but it collapses by a wave of the hand, and so the spider's house is indeed the flimsiest of all houses if only they -the infidels- know","29:42":"Indeed, Allah knows all things and He is Omniscient of everything animate or inanimate -the infidels- invoke besides Him. He is AL-Aziz and AL-Hakim (characterized by good sense and Prudence) (the Wise)","29:43":"Such parables do We discourse to people -that they might hopefully ponder-.

Declare your thoughts in words, thus: \"We do acknowledge all that has been revealed to us and to you. Our Ilah and your Ilah is One and to Him We bow to the ground in Islam and adoration","29:47":"And just as We had revealed the Book to Messengers before you O Muhammad, We have revealed to you the Book -the Quran- which has been acknowledged by those among Ahl AL-Kitab who applied their minds to the acquisition of learning and thought intently and reflected. And this due recognition is shared by some of your people. And no one denies Our divine discourse and rejects Our revelations but the infidels who deny Allah","29:48":"Had you been -O Muhammad- a learned man who read books before the Quran and were able to give expression to your feelings and your thoughts in writing and transcribe it with your right hand, this would have raised suspicion among those who take pleasure in the vanity of wickedness","29:49":"But the Quran, is indeed a divine discourse expressing explicitly revelations easily intelligible in the hearts and minds of those who are well founded in knowledge and do-know the facts.

We arranged your matrimonial union with her. so that those who conformed to Islam would not feel they shall stand at the mark of criticism should they be willing to marry the women who were once married to their adopted sons who have attained their object of divorce and the formalities have been fulfilled. Allah's command must be fulfilled","33:38":"The Prophet incurs no blame nor does he stand at the mark of criticism when he carries into effect an edict issued by Allah; a mode of action Allah had pursued with the prophets of old. And Allah's edict has always been determinable, authoritatively decided and definitely ascertained","33:39":"Those were the Prophets entrusted with Allah's divine message which they related to the people and they regarded Allah with reverence and awe and they feared no one but Him, and enough is Allah to call people to account here and Hereafter","33:40":"Muhammad is not the father of anyone of your men so that He be prohibited to carry into effect Allah's edict but he is Allah's Messenger and the ultimate and a seal of the Prophets, and Allah has always been 'Alimun of all in all","33:41":"O you who have conformed to Islam, apply remembrance to Allah as often as you can","33:42":"And praise Him and extol His glorious attributes at the beginning and the close of the day","33:43":"It is He Who extends to you His mercy as do His angels so that He guides you out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment. He has always been Rahimun to those in whose hearts reigns piety","33:44":"The Day they -these people of piety- assemble before Him in Day of Judgement shall they be greeted with the expression of good will \"Peace\", and Allah will have prepared for them gracefully blessed provisions","33:45":"O you the Prophet: We have sent you, to the people to be a witness lo their response to the divine message and a spectacle and a warning and a herald of joyful tidings","33:46":"And to present to them inducements helping them shake off falsehood and be attracted to Allah and by His permission conform to His system of faith and worship, and that you stand among them as a source of spiritual light from whom emanates illumination and enlightenment","33:47":"And be sure to announce joyful tidings to those who faithfully conform to Allah's system of faith and worship to expect the great bounty of Providence. It includes the divine influence operating in men to regenerate and sanctify and imparts strength to endure trial and resist temptation","33:48":"And do not obey the infidels nor the hypocrites nor be influenced by their views or notions and pay no attention to their insults and annoyances and put your trust in Allah and enough is He to be your tutelary Guardian Who exercises protecting vigilance over you","33:49":"O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: if you have been married to women of the same law and you divorce them before you have consummated marriage then you have no claim upon them to fulfill the prescribed set period of waiting and set them free gracefully","33:50":"O you the Prophet: We have ratified and confirmed by sanction and solemn enactment your wives whom you have dowered as well as those on hand -the prisoners of war- whom Allah has made assignable to you. Also lawful to you are the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts who emigrated with you in addition to any woman of the same law who dedicates herself to the Prophet and the Prophet wishes to be bound to her in wedlock. This is a privilege that is granted to you exclusively and not to the Muslims at large. We know what We have promulgated and legislated for them concerning their wives and those on hand so that you do not feel that you stand at the mark of criticism and Allah has always been Ghafurun and Rahimun","33:51":"You incur no blame should you defer the turn of whom you will and bring over to your side whom you will and whom you choose of those whose turn you have deferred. This will make them happy and their eyes will speak content and they will not grieve at heart, they will all be satisfied with what you have accorded them and Allah knows what is in your hearts and in your minds. Allah has always been 'Alimun and Halimun (Forbearing toward His creatures)","33:52":"(And as of now) You are not permitted O Muhammad to unite in wedlock with more women nor are you permitted to change those you have for other wives even if their beauty attracts your eyes and captivates your heart except those you have on hand. And Allah, has always been Raqibun keeping a vigilant eye upon all things","33:53":"O you who have conformed to Allah's system of faith and worship: Do not enter the Prophet's houses unless you are permitted to do so for a meal, in which case you do not sit waiting for the food until it be ready. But if you are invited then you enter not too early but at the time expected and when you have dined then be excused and do realize that dispersion then is a necessary circumstance to be fulfilled. And do not linger to engage in a sociable discourse, for such behaviour has always caused inconvenience to the Prophet who is ashamed to ask you to leave, but Allah is not ashamed of declaring the truth. And if you wish to ask them for anything you want you must ask them from behind a screen. This has more influence on your hearts and their hearts to possess virtue in life and conduct. By no means should you cause annoyance or inconvenience to the Messenger of Allah nor is it appropriate ever to marry his widows following his death. This is an enormity in Allah's sight and a deviation from moral righteousness","33:54":"Whether you reveal your deeds and express your thoughts or hide the deeds and suggest the thoughts secretly to the mind, you must realize that Allah is indeed 'Alimun of all things","33:55":"Your wives O Muhammad incur no blame nor do they stand at the mark of criticism for discoursing and appearing before their fathers or before their sons, before their brothers or their brothers' sons, before their sisters' sons or before their women or before those who serve them of those they have on hand. As for you O wives of the Prophet: you actuate yourselves with the mixed feeling of dread and reverence toward Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and bear in mind that He is ever a witness to all things","33:56":"Allah and His angels extend mercy and blessings to the Prophet. O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: invoke Allah's mercy and blessings on him and pray: \"Peace be upon him and blessed be he with all divine favours","33:57":"Indeed, those who defy Allah and His Messenger or challenge them, have come within the measure of Allah's wrath and have incurred Allah's curse here and Hereafter and there awaits them the torment laid upon the damned","33:58":"And those who unjustly hurt the men or the women in whose hearts reigns piety or offend them for no valid reason will have born malice against themselves and shall stand manifest of a major sin","33:59":"O you the Prophet: Tell your wives and your daughters and all Muslim women to dress in flowing outer garments which cover them over. This makes it less likely to be identified and be assaulted. And Allah has always been Ghafurun and Rahimun","33:60":"Unless the hypocrites and those whose hearts reflect the morbidity inherent in their inmost being as well as those who incite to rebellion against the Muslims in the city and molest the women cease from such actions, We will instigate you to war upon them and give you mastery over them and they shall then find it difficult to neighbour with you therein but for a short while","33:61":"Cursed wherever they may be and seized they shall be wherever found and be slain without mercy","33:62":"A mode of action Allah has long pursued in dealing with those who came to this world before you and you shall not find a change in His mode of action","33:63":"People call upon you O Muhammad for information relative to the point of time at which the predetermined Eventful Hour of Judgement takes place! Say to them: it is only Allah and Him alone Who knows when! \"You never know the Final Hour may well be quite soon","33:64":"Allah has cursed the infidels and upon them He has poured maledictions and put for them in readiness the tormenting blaze of Hell","33:65":"wherein they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering and never shall they find therein anyone to protect them nor afford them help","33:66":"This is a Day when their faces shall be rolled in the Fire and they shall wish they had obeyed Allah and obeyed His Messenger","33:67":"And they shall say: \"O Allah, our Creator, We have obeyed those who were invested with authority among us and those who were exalted in rank and in station and they led us by the nose to the wrong path","33:68":"O Allah, our Creator \"they add\" We implore You and We beg You to afflict them with double the torment and to consign them to evil and to pour upon them unbearable loads of maledictions","33:69":"O you who have conformed to Allah's system of faith and worship: Do not act like those who wronged Mussa but Allah proclaimed his innocence and he has always been held precious in Allah's esteem","33:70":"O you who have conformed to Islam: Fear Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him. When you express your thoughts in words and when you make a statement or a declaration, do see that your words are a disclosure of facts, apposite, appropriate, relevant and to the point","33:71":"So that Allah steers you by His guidance to the right doings and actions and blesses your deeds and makes them agree with your words and forgives you your sins. And he who obeys Allah and His Messenger will have gained great victory and obtained supremacy","33:72":"We offered the \"trust\" to the heavens, the earth and the mountains -with what it entails of expectation of knowing and reasoning, of feeling and thinking and of obligations and responsibilities- but they declined to bear it for what it involves of burdensome consequences. But man (Adam -his genes-) accepted it and was willing to bear the responsibility and to give an undertaking of fidelity; He was indeed unfair to himself, having no knowledge of the logical Sequence","33:73":"By consequence shall Allah punish the hypocrites, men and women, and the idolaters and idolatresses who incorporate with Him other deities and He shall give up resentment against the men and the women who faithfully acknowledged His system of faith and worship and pardon their offence. And Allah has always been Ghafurun and Rahimun","34:1":"Praise be to Allah to Whom our bosoms surge forth and answer thanks for His exclusive individuality in possessing all the animate and the inanimate existing in the heavens and on earth past, present and those to come and extolled are His glorious attributes Hereafter as He is AL-Hakim (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations) and AL-Khabir (the Omniscient)","34:2":"He has omniscience of all that makes entry and penetrates into the earth, be it animate or inanimate, and of all that arises from it and of what erupts from within and of the water streaming out of it.

He shall extend to them forgiveness and a gracefully blessed provision","34:5":"And He justly penalizes those who purposed to deny His revelations and challenge His divine and authoritative signs. They must expect the torment laid upon the damned","34:6":"Whereas those gifted with divine and spiritual knowledge do know and assert that the discourse inspired to you from Allah is indeed the truth guiding into all truth and it guides to the path that leads directly to Him, AL-Aziz (the Almighty), and AL-Hamid (to Whom are extolled the glorious attributes)","34:7":"And insolently and mockingly, the infidels say: \"Shall we tell you of a man who proclaims that after your bodies have been reduced to fragments and have disintegrated, you will be brought back to life and be created anew","34:8":"Is he relating to Allah falsehood and pathological lies or is he a demoniac!\" The fact is that those who deny Resurrection and Judgement are torturing themselves with their thoughts, being lost in the maze of error","34:9":"Do they not see what is before them and what is behind them of the heavens and the earth and contemplate their existence, maintenance and conservation. If We willed We could eclipse them in one swallow by a yawning earthly chasm We create beneath them or cause a piece of heaven to fall upon them in the form of discs of cumuli; either incident is by itself a great inducement for lifting to Allah the inward sight by the votary devoted to religious observances and to repentance with a breast filled with reverential awe","34:10":"We bestowed on Dawud of Our bounty all grace which was made to abound in him. \"O you mountains\", We said, \"play the echo to his praises, and so will you O birds\" and We softened for him the iron for making defensive armour","34:11":"We directed him, thus: \"Make coats of arms\", We said, \"and use your skill and talent in the construction of the chain- work and in the overlapping of the plates to be fastened upon the ground-work\". And We said to him and his family: \"Do good and imprint your deeds and thoughts with wisdom and piety, I am Bassirun of all that you do","34:12":"And to Solayman We made subservient the wind covering the distance, normally taking one month, in one morning stride forward and turning in one evening stride backward. We made a source of copper flow freely for him and of the Jinn those serving him by Allah's will, and he -of the Jinn- who defected or did not fulfill Allah's command came within the measure of Allah's wrath and We subjected him to the blazes","34:13":"They -the Jinn- were assigned to work for him and do as they were told and produce, build and construct for him what he willed of sanctuaries and places of worship in the form of curved structures of firm material; some bearing weight and others merely ornamental.

And We said: \"Work righteousness O you the sons of Dawud and let your deeds reflect gratitude and gratefulness to Me\". But it is only a few of My servants who do this and impel themselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness","34:14":"And when We decreed Solayman's death, nothing drew the Jinn's attention to his death but a little earthly creature gnawing the base of his staff on which he leaned that he fell. There and then did the Jinn realize that had they known the hidden and the unknown and realized the unseen they would not have remained in the slavish disposition scourged with humility and torture","34:15":"There was a great sign indicative of Allah's mercy and bounty which were extended to the people of Saba in their home-land and Allah's grace was made to abound in them. They enjoyed fertile and productive land covered with carpets of greenery and orchards right and left; they were told: \"Eat of what Allah has provisioned you of sustenance and enjoy it, it is all replete with choice of all delight and be thankful to Him. Productive of incalculable good was the land and Gracious and Ghafurun, the Ilah, the Creator","34:16":"But they declined to show appreciation of the condition of things and be sensible of Allah's grace, and furthermore they failed to impel themselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness. By consequence, We sent against them torrential rain causing destruction of their dam, built to confine the water and to regulate its flow, and We replaced their fertile land and their orchards with gardens of bitter fruit, shrubs of small tamarisk trees and a few of the Lotus trees and other trees carrying berry- like drupe","34:17":"Such was the thrashing We gave those who welcomed wrongs, but then do We punish but the ungrateful who deviates from sense and declines the divine standard","34:18":"Yet We did not tear them apart but We kept the villages which stood conspicuous between their towns and the towns We blessed.* And We made these villages - serve as stations or stopping-places on their journeys and their commercial travels, And We determined the distances and the units of time to a scale inducing the feeling of comfort and safety and We said to them: You may travel by night or by day, you will be safe and secure","34:19":"But lacking patience and endurance, they, to their detriment, prayed: \"O Allah, our Creator, would You make our stations distant and far apart and not close together and our commercial travels remote in time\" and they wronged themselves. In response to this request We made them the talk of the town existing then and of those towns existing thereafter. We tore them apart, while those who remained lived dispersed among the Bedouins in the desert and among other people else-where. This was an act making the patient who is thankful lift to Allah his inward sight","34:20":"And sure enough was AL-Shaytan (Satan) in the right when he thought he would be able to lead them by the nose to their loss in the maze of error. They followed his footsteps except those few who revered Allah and were faithful to Him","34:21":"In fact AL-Shaytan had no authority over them but We occasioned his attempt to tempt them to identify justly those who affirm with certainty and satisfaction the fundamental truth of the Hereafter and those who are in doubt thereof.

And he who presents himself with a heart impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety will have successfully saved his own soul, and to Allah is the final and inevitable destination","35:19":"They are not esteemed alike: those who lack intellectual, moral and spiritual perception and those who perceive mentally and apprehend the truth by thought","35:20":"Nor do they compare: the abysm of darkness and/or want of spiritual and intellectual sight and the illumination and enlightenment and the emanation of light","35:21":"Nor are they of a like nature: \"the shade\" affording coolness and the sun radiating heat","35:22":"Nor do the living -a life deserving the name- and the dead physically or spiritually compare. Allah's voice reaches whom He will but your voice O Muhammad shall never reach those deposited in the graves","35:23":"You arc only a spectacle and a warning","35:24":"We have sent you with the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and never was there a nation but had a Messenger, a spectacle and a warning","35:25":"And if they -the infidels- do reject the divine message and accuse you of falsehood and regard you as someone who passes himself off as someone other than he is, then you must realize that similarly acted those who preceded them They received Messengers with the divine message carrying evidence sufficient enough to establish their authority to implement Our statutes and Our Scriptures as well as the Book of enlightenment and illumination","35:26":"In consequence, did I cast them from a position of prosperity and power and brought them to ruin and how unbearable and befitting was the retribution","35:27":"Do you not sec that Allah sends down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain water causing the fruits to spring up from the soil in various colours. He made in the mountains paths, natural roads, passages and tracks of varied hues: white and red of various shades and others of raven black (each reflecting the colour of the dominant mineral its rocks contain)","35:28":"And of people, reptilian and cattle variegation also holds true. Thus, such of Allah's servants as stand in awe of Him are the savants. Allah is Azizun (Almighty) and Ghafurun (Forgiving)","35:29":"Indeed, those who recite Allah's Book -to themselves or to an audience- - from memory or by reading and in an appropriate manner- and observe their act of worship and do spend of what We bestowed on them of Our bounty in Allah's cause and in benevolence secretly and openly must expect a satisfying return for the commerce they have between Allah and themselves and in their intercourse in the affairs of life","35:30":"This is to satisfy their needs, to reward them with what is commensurate with their deeds and to make His grace abound in them, He is indeed Ghafurun and Shakurun (Thankful)","35:31":"And rest assured O Muhammad that all that We inspire to you of the Book -the Quran- is indeed the truth personified. It corroborates and confirms what had preceded of divine Books and Scriptures. He is indeed Khabirun (Omniscient) and Bassirun (the Omnipresent) Whose constant vigilance is extended to all His creatures","35:32":"And We made the Book an heritage We bequeathed to such of Our servants as We have chosen and taken by preference. Some of them, the wrongful of actions, are being unfair to themselves. Others choose a middle way between right and wrong and some do vie by the grace of Allah in doing all that is good and all that reflects wisdom and piety. This is indeed the sufficient grace abounding in whom He will as well as the efficacious grace which effects the end for which it is given","35:33":"Such persons who vie in doing good are those who shall be heartily welcomed in the Gardens of Eden wherein they shall be destined to make abode and wherein they shall be adorned with golden and pearled-bracelets and vested all in silken attire","35:34":"Actuated with the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness they shall express their thoughts in words, thus: \"We are indeed grateful to Allah Who has redeemed us out of all dread and sorrow and of the insecure feeling and the harassing anxiety of this Event\". \"Allah, our Creator, is indeed Ghafurun and Shakurun","35:35":"So gracious He is as to settle us in the Eternal abode wherein no touch of struggle mentally or physically shall there be and free from all touch of weariness we will be","35:36":"But those -infidels- who deny Him shall have to suffer for it. Hell shall assert them as her own and therein they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering. Never shall they perish in the wreck of time or suffer death nor shall their torment be mitigated, for thus do We requite the ungrateful who display no gratitude","35:37":"While in the abysm of Hell, they shall implore Allah in a loud and excited voice, thus: O Allah, our Creator, deliver us out of it. We will imprint our deeds with wisdom and piety contrary to the wrong and the evil We did before. But they shall be told. \"Did We not give you life long enough to give a chance to him who was willing to open his heart's ears and to lift to Allah his inward sight!. You received Allah's Messengers who warned you of this unbearable Eventful Event!

He holds prescience of all private thoughts and feelings that are reposited in the breasts","35:39":"He is it Who has inducted you vicegerents on earth and made one generation inherit the other. Therefore, he who rejects the truth and denies the divine origin of the message will have hurt himself with his infidelity and nothing infidelity adds to the infidels' debit in heaven's realm but hatred and aversions And nothing infidelity adds to their fate but loss and ruin and moral and spiritual damnation","35:40":"Say to them O Muhammad: Do you -infidels- see those whom you regard as your predominant partners and invoke besides Allah! Show me what section of the earth they have created, or do they go shares with Allah in the sovereignty of the heavens and they are the possessors thereof! Or did We give them a Book illuminating their eyes and imparting spiritual and intellectual enlightenment! The fact is that the wrongful of actions make promises to each other and nothing they promise but what is vain, deceptive and deluding","35:41":"Allah is He Who sustains and supports the heavens (their contents) and keeps them from going out of order losing balance or scattering and vanishing. Should they be thrown about in disorder, who else other than Him can restore them to order! He has always been Halimun (forbearing) and Ghafurun","35:42":"The infidels make a solemn declaration with an appeal to Allah that if there comes to them a spectacle and warning they would regard him with more reverence than any other people and they would be more prepared than all others to acknowledge the message of truth guiding into all truth. Yet when there came to them the spectacle and the warning their mental attitude -pitifully- made them more averse","35:43":"Their rejection of the truth reflected their inordinate self-esteem and their extravagance in their accounts of themselves; they took their cunning for a sinister and crooked wisdom, a cunning fraught with evil. But the cunning that is fraught with evil besets only those who take it for a sinister and crooked wisdom. Do they not see into the mode of action adopted by Allah with those of old and has long been pursued by Him. -His just retributive punishment!- And you shall not find a change in Allah's mode of action nor shall you find deviation in His method of dealing with people -warning then punishing","35:44":"Have they not journeyed through the land and looked with their minds' eyes to see what was the end of those who preceded them who were far mightier than they are and their diligence never wearied! Nonetheless, their might conferred on them no immunity against Allah's retributive punishment. Nothing irrespective of its nature can stand in Allah's way or impede His course of action or frustrate the laws and statutes of His realm in the heavens or on earth; He has always been 'Alimun and Qadirun","35:45":"If Allah were to plant the People's Hereafter in the now and impose on them what is commensurate with their deeds, not one single earthling animate being would be left on its surface. But He mercifully respites them to a predetermined point of time that they might hopefully deviate into sense and turn to Him. When it is time to pay to nature their due debt they shall come to know that Allah has always been Bassirun keeping a vigilant eye upon all this created beings","36:1":"(Ya), S. (Seen), the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people’s tongue, cannot be emulated","36:2":"And by the Quran, the prime source of wisdom","36:3":"You Muhammad are indeed one of the Messengers chosen to relate Allah’s divine message","36:4":"And you are pursuing the path of righteousness","36:5":"A disclosure of divine knowledge sent down from the realm of heaven by the command of the AL-Aziz (the Almighty), AL-Rahim","36:6":"And you shall use it O Muhammad as the divine law expressing the will of Allah to warn a people whose fathers received no Messenger as a spectacle and a warning before; and they are oblivious of what they owe to Allah, to themselves and to the people at large","36:7":"The prophecy of their aversion to the divine message by the majority has been fulfilled, for they decline to accept it","36:8":"We have surrounded their necks with chains drawn up to their chins restraining the movement of their heads and riveting their eyes and their minds away from the truth","36:9":"And We erected a barrier before them and a barrier behind them to eclipse their minds' eyes to deny them forethought and foresight; and Allah's marvels around them and in themselves they fail to see","36:10":"Such persons O Muhammad whether you warn them of impending danger and misfortunes or you do not, it is one and the same; they counsel deaf and will not open their hearts' ears nor their minds’ eyes","36:11":"Your voice can be heard only by those who hear the voice of Allah expressing His will in the Quran and keep in awe of Him albeit not apprehending Him by sight.

We sustained them by a third who together with the other two assured them thus: \"We have been commissioned by Allah\". they said, \"and entrusted with His divine message which we relate to you","36:15":"But the inhabitants said: \"But you are simply mortals like us and never did Allah, AL-Rahman, disclose divine knowledge or anything else to a mortal: \"You are indeed liars","36:16":"And there, the messengers said: \" Indeed, does Allah, our Creator, know that we have been entrusted with His divine message to relate it to you","36:17":"And we are responsible only for proclaiming His divine message distinctly expressing all that is meant, leaving nothing merely implied","36:18":"But again the people said to the Messengers: \"We augur from you and we esteem you as omens presaging some direful calamity, therefore unless you stop holding discourse of this faked message, we will pelt you with stones and you shall suffer grievously at our hands","36:19":"The Messengers said: \"You augur well or ill according to your disposition and your intentions, and the mould of your fortune is in yourselves and the event is only sanctioned by Allah\". And do you people, they added, \"consider the spirit of truth that guides into all truth a presage of evil! You are but a people characterized by disobedience and transgression","36:20":"And there came a man from the far end of the city, moved with compassion for his fellow men who rejected what he knew to be the truth, to say to them: \"O my people, obey them, they are Messengers entrusted with the spirit of truth- that guides into all truth","36:21":"Obey them\", he added, \"they do not ask you for a price or anything in return, they themselves are guided into all truth and wish to relate it to you","36:22":"And why should I not regard Allah with extreme devotion\", he said, \"and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites when it is He Who brought me into being and caused me to exist and He is the end and the purpose for which We are destined and to Him shall all of us return","36:23":"Therefore, would I take besides Him gods whose intercession, if ever permitted, is valueless nor can they protect me or save me from harm should He, AL-Rahman, mean to befall me with a misfortune or wed me to a calamity","36:24":"For then the work of the devil will have been manifest in me and I would have been led by the nose to the loss in the maze of error","36:25":"Hear me\", he said, \"as I declare that I have acknowledged Allah, your Creator, and accepted His system of faith and worship with a consenting mind and you shall bear witness to this declaration here and Hereafter","36:26":"(The man might have suffered martyrdom at their hands) Received with gracious and hearty welcome and great honour in heaven’s Realm, he was ushered to Paradise and there he exclaimed: \"I wish my people knew","36:27":"How has Allah, my Creator, received me, forgiven me and united me with those who are highly esteemed and greatly honoured","36:28":"We did not follow this incident by sending down a host from heaven against his people nor was it necessary to mobilize Our angels","36:29":"All it took was a single direful cry from heaven’s realm that stirred up a merciless blast extinguishing them and blotting them out of existence","36:30":"A great pity upon intellectual animate beings and servants! No Messenger do they receive as an envoy of Allah but they bombard him with foul epithets, mock him and laugh him to scorn","36:31":"Do they not perceive by sight, apprehend by thought and learn by reading how many generations who existed before them We have destroyed and they had gone whence they shall not return","36:32":"And that they together with their predecessors and their predominant partners and those they incorporated with Allah shall be brought back to Us and be gathered for Judgement","36:33":"A blessing is being extended to them to contemplate, an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace: \"the dead land which We revive and from its soil We cause grain to spring out for them to eat","36:34":"And We furnished the land out with orchards of date-palms and vines and gave vent to affluence of flowing springs","36:35":"So that they eat of their flowers when they come to be fruits and grow ripe.

They apparently incline their ears to you while their hearts' ears are closed, and when they leave at the end of your discourse of instructions and exhortation, they, in a cunning manner, ask your faithful associates who have intellectual acquaintance with facts: \"What was it that he -Muhammad- has just said?\" These are they whose hearts has Allah impressed with dullness of comprehension and they followed their own lustful course and a religion of a sensuous character","47:17":"But those whose minds' eyes have led them to the path of safety and righteousness, Allah has justified faith as a conviction operative on their character and will and imprinted their deeds with wisdom and piety","47:18":"Do they (The infidel Meccans together with the hypocrites) intend to remain in their state of disbelief until they suddenly face the foreordained Hour?

But in any case, you will recognize them when they express their thoughts in words in an air of contempt and they adjust them to their malicious attitude. Allah Knows all that they do","47:31":"In fact, We will most certainly try you people to distinguish you into those who consider Allah's purpose the heart of their purpose and strive patiently in His cause, and those who are not moved to action; and to ascertain your spirit and your worth when you engage in the practical test of actual experience","47:32":"Those who denied Allah and stood in the way to prevent Allah's spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth, and forsook the Messenger after the truth was made evident to them by heaven and by men, shall not harm Allah in the least, but He will imprint their deeds with irreverence, profanity and damnation","47:33":"O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: obey Allah and obey the Messenger and do not render your deeds void and devoid of real value by renouncing Faith","47:34":"Indeed, those who have renounced Faith and prevented Allah's spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth and they died captivated in disbelief, never will Allah forgive them nor quit them His debt","47:35":"Therefore do not weaken in power or in strength of purpose nor be tempted to invite your enemy to peace when you are in control of the situation and you have the upper hand.

Some of you will show unwillingness, and he who is parsimonious and unwilling, will only deny himself the future security depending on how much he had advanced in life to be credited to his own account in heaven's realm. And remember that Allah is AL-Ghaniy (Independent and Absolute); He is the riches of the heavens and the earth and if you are as dependent on Him as indeed you are, then you are poor enough and if you people turn a deaf ear, He will replace you by other people who will not be the like","48:1":"We have opened for you O Muhammad the way of wisdom, and We have circumstanced the matters of fact in Our own manner to give you access to every virtue which makes fortune and victory sit on your Helm","48:2":"As a logical inference, Allah forgives you all your faults of the past and also those to come, and complements His bounty and munificence on you and guides you to the path of safety and righteousness","48:3":"And Allah helps you gain the mastery and be exaltedly triumphant","48:4":"It was He Who inspired peace and tranquility to the hearts of the believers whose breasts are filled with reverential awe, so that their hearts be impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, and their deeds with wisdom and piety.

Their countenances bear evidence of prostrating their reason to Divine Revelation and their looks are bright, beaming with hope. This is the product of a sequence of events portrayed as such in the graphic appearance described thus early in AL-Tawrah (the Torah) and AL-Injil (the Bible). It is a picture standing similitude exact of a seed which began to spring, putting forth its stalk which grew stronger and stronger. It supported leaves, flowers and fruits, displaying a spectacular and imposing situation distressing those who deny Allah and throwing them into mental disorder and discomposure. To those of them, whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds of wisdom and piety, has Allah promised a gracious reward","49:1":"O you who believe with hearts reflecting the image of religious and spiritual virtues and with works imprinted with wisdom and piety: Do not precede Allah and His Messenger in expressing judgment or belief, view or notion and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; He is Sami'un (Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and Alimun (Omniscient)","49:2":"O you who believe with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety: Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Messenger, nor speak to him loudly in the manner you speak to one another lest unawares your hopes should be doomed to disappointment and your deeds to worthlessness","49:3":"Indeed, those who lower their voices when they have audience with the Messenger of Allah arc those whose style in discourse reveals their character which is imbued with Grace divine, and whose breast has Allah filled with reverence and piety; they merit forgiveness and a great reward","49:4":"Those who call you O Muhammad, from without the chambers of your wives; most of them do not have the sense nor the knowledge of how to act under given conditions","49:5":"If they had reconsidered it and decided more wisely to wait quietly until you have come out, it would have been better for them, but Allah is Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)","49:6":"O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual Virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety: If ever there comes to you someone known to be immoral or potentially harmful, pernicious, malicious or mischievous, and relates to you a message or an event, an incident or something he heard, then be objectively certain of the truth to preclude risk of error and the consequence of wrong action and of injuring the reputation of a people or defaming them in ignorance, and later be pitifully regretful for what you have done","49:7":"And you must realize that the Messenger of Allah is in your midst. If he were to a submit to your wishes and yield to you in many of the matters, you would be befallen with misfortunes, But Allah has touched your hearts with the divine hand to create in them affection for the Faith and to make you regard it with an eye of favour, He made you hate disbelief, immorality and disobedience with heart and hand.

Nor should women laugh at other women with the intention of producing a specified deriding or ridiculing, or contemptuous effect upon one another. It may be that the laughees are better than the laughers in many aspects. Moreover do not defame one another nor nickname each other by insulting or repulsive derogatory names. How bad it is to be called malicious or wicked after having professed the Faith with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety! And he who does not change his mind with regard to past conduct, then such persons are guilty of wrongful actions. \"The man that dares traduce because he can, with safety to himself, is not a man \" \"Cowper\" Suspicion in some instances is indeed a sin","49:12":"O you who believe with hearts reflecting the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety.

Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother! Indeed you would shrink from it with horror. Therefore, keep Allah in mind and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, Allah is indeed Tawabun (Relenting) and Rahimun (Merciful). Allah indicates to people that He weighs them not by their parentage, lineage, descent or rank in life, but by the image their hearts reflect","49:13":"O you people; We created you from the union of a twain, male and female, and We divided you into nations and communities and dispersed you over the earth to get to know each other and not to boast your descent or rank. The one among you whom Allah values most and is held precious in His esteem is he who keeps Allah in mind and acquaints his heart with wisdom, and regards Allah with breast filled with reverential awe. Allah is Alimun, and Khabirun (intimately acquainted with all things). A tribe named Banu Asad went to Madinab, where the Messenger had emigrated, seeking relief for their families by reason whereof a famine had ensued that year.
