And God is Seeing of what you do","2:266":"Would anyone of you wish that he have a garden of date palm trees and grapevines beneath which rivers run with all kinds of fruits in it for him? Then, old age lit on him, and he had weak offspring. Then, a whirlwind lit on it in which there is a fire. Then, it was consumed.

And whatever of good you spend, it is for yourselves. And spend not but looking for the Countenance of God. And whatever of good you spend, your account will be paid to you in full and you will not be wronged","2:273":"Spend for the poor, those who were restrained in the way of God and are not able to travel on the earth.

And whatever of good you spend, then, truly, God is Knowing of that","2:274":"Those who spend their wealth by nighttime and daytime, secretly or in public, then, for them, their compensation is with their Lord. And there will be neither fear in them nor will they feel remorse","2:275":"Those who consume usury will not arise, but like he who arises whom Satan prostrated by touch. That is because they said: Trading is only like usury and yet God permitted trading and forbade usury. So whoever drew near an admonishment from his Lord and refrained himself, for him is what was past. And his command is with God. While whoever reverted, then, those will be the Companions of the Fire. They, ones who will dwell in it forever","2:276":"God eliminates usury, and He causes charity to increase. And God loves not any sinful ingrate","2:277":"Truly, those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality and performed the formal prayer and gave the purifying alms, for them, their compensation is with their Lord.

When you contracted a debt for a term—that which is determined—then, write it down. Let one who is a scribe write it down between you justly. One who is a scribe should not refuse to write it down as God taught him. So let him write down and let the debtor dictate. Let him be Godfearing of God, his Lord, and diminish not anything out of it. But if the debtor had been mentally deficient, or weak, or not able to dictate himself, then, let his protector dictate justly. And call two witnesses to bear witness from among your men. Or if there are not two men, then a man and two women, with whom you are well-pleased as witnesses, so that if one of them (f) goes astray, then, the other one of the two will remind her. And the witnesses will not refuse when they were called. And grow not weary that you write it down, be it small or great, with its term. That is more equitable with God and more upright for testimony, and likelier not to be in doubt unless it be a trade, that which is transferred at the time—to give and take among yourselves. Then, there is no blame on you if you not write it down. And call witnesses when you have a transaction. Let neither one who is a scribe nor witness be pressed. And if you accomplish that, then, it is, truly, disobedience on your part. So be Godfearing of God. And God teaches you. And God is Knowing of everything","2:283":"And if you had been on a journey and find no one who is a scribe, then, a guarantee of that which is held in hand.

And the ones who are firmly rooted in knowledge say: We believed in it as all is from our Lord. And none recollects, but those imbued with intuition","3:8":"Our Lord! Cause our hearts not to swerve after Thou hadst guided us. And bestow on us mercy from that which proceeds from Thy Presence. Truly, Thou, Thou alone art The Giver","3:9":"Our Lord! Truly, Thou art One Who Gathers humanity on a Day in which there is no doubt in it. Truly, God breaks not His solemn declaration","3:10":"Truly, those who were ungrateful, it will not avail them—neither their wealth nor their children—against God at all. And those, they will be fuel for the fire","3:11":"in like manner of the people of Pharaoh and those who were before them. They denied Our signs so God took them because of their impiety. And God is Severe in repayment","3:12":"Say to those who were ungrateful: You will be vanquished and you will be assembled into hell. It will be a miserable Final Place","3:13":"Surely, there had been a sign for you in the two factions who met one another—one faction fights in the way of God and the other as ones who are ungrateful, whom they see twice the like of visibly in their eyes.

Then, move forward in companies of men or move forward altogether","4:72":"And, truly, among you is he who lingers behind. Then, if affliction lit on you, he would say: Surely, God was gracious to me that I not be a witness to them","4:73":"And if the grace of God lit on you, certainly, he would say, as if there be not any affection between you and between him: Would that I had been with them so that I would have won a triumph, winning a sublime triumph","4:74":"Then, let fight in the way of God those who sell this present life for the world to come.

Why hadst Thou prescribed fighting for us? Why hadst Thou not postponed it for another near term for us? Say: The enjoyment of the present is little and the world to come is better. For whomever was Godfearing, you will not be wronged in the least","4:78":"Wherever you be, death will overtake you, even if you had been in imposing towers.

And whomever He wills, He lays on a straight path","6:40":"Say: Considered you that if the punishment of God approached you or the Hour approached you, would you call to any other than God if you had been ones who are sincere","6:41":"Nay! To Him alone you would call and He would remove that for which you call to Him—if He willed—and you will forget whatever partners you ascribe with Him","6:42":"And, certainly, We sent to communities that were before thee. Then, We took them with desolation and tribulation so that perhaps they will lower themselves to Us","6:43":"Then, why when drew near them Our might, they lowered not themselves? Rather, their hearts became hard. And Satan made appear pleasing to them what they had been doing","6:44":"So when they forgot about what they were reminded in it, We opened to them the doors of everything. Until when they were glad with what they were given, We suddenly took them. That is when they were ones who are seized with despair","6:45":"So cut off were the last remnant of the folk who did wrong. And The Praise belongs to God, Lord of the worlds","6:46":"Say: Considered you that if God took your having the ability to hear and your sight and sealed over your hearts, what god other than God restores them to you? Look on how We diversify the signs! Again, they still drew aside","6:47":"Say: Considered you that if the punishment of God approached you suddenly or publicly, will anyone be caused to perish but the folk, the ones who are unjust","6:48":"We send not the ones who are sent, but as ones who give good tidings and ones who warn. So whoever believed and made things right, then, there will be neither fear in them nor will they feel remorse","6:49":"But those who denied Our signs, the punishment will afflict them because they had been disobeying","6:50":"Say: I say not to you: With me are treasures of God nor that I know the unseen nor say I to you that I am an angel. I follow only what is revealed to me. Say: Are they on the same level— the unwilling to see and the seeing? Will you, then, not reflect","6:51":"And warn with the Quran those who fear that they will be assembled before their Lord. Other than He there is neither a protector nor an intercessor, so that perhaps they will be Godfearing","6:52":"And drive not away those who call to their Lord in the morning and the evening, wanting His Countenance. Their reckoning is not on thee at all. And thy reckoning is not on them at all. If thou wast to drive them away, then, thou wouldst be among the ones who are unjust","6:53":"Thus, We tried some of them with others that they should say: Is it these to whom God showed grace from among us? Is not God greater in knowledge of the ones who are thankful","6:54":"And when drew near thee, those who believe in Our signs, say: Peace be to you. Your Lord prescribed mercy for Himself so that anyone of you who did evil in ignorance—again, repented afterwards and made things right—then, truly, He is Forgiving, Compassionate","6:55":"And, thus, We explain Our signs distinctly so that the way is indicated for the ones who sin","6:56":"Say: I was prohibited that I worship those whom you call to other than God. Say: I will not follow your desires, for, then, I would have gone astray. I would not be of the ones who are truly guided","6:57":"Say: I am with a clear portent from my Lord and you denied it. I have not of that which you seek to hasten. The determination is with God. He relates The Truth. And He is Best of the ones who distinguish truth from falsehood","6:58":"Say: Truly, if with me was what you seek to hasten, the command would be decided between me and between you. And God is greater in knowledge of the ones who are unjust","6:59":"With Him are the keys of the unseen. None knows them but He. And He knows whatever is on dry land and in the sea. Not a leaf descends but He knows it, nor a grain in the shadows of the earth, nor fresh nor dry thing, but it is in a clear Book","6:60":"It is He Who gathers you to Himself by nighttime and He knows what you were busy with by daytime. Again, He raises you up in it so that the term, that which is determined, is decided. Again, to Him is your return. Again, He will tell you of what you had been doing","6:61":"And He is The One Who Is Omniscient over His servants. And He sends over you recorders until when death drew near one of you. Our messengers gathered him to themselves and they neglect not","6:62":"Again, they would be returned to God, their Defender, The True. Is not the determination for Him? And He is The Swiftest of the ones who reckon","6:63":"Say: Who delivers you from the shadows of the dry land and the sea? You call to Him humbly and inwardly: If Thou wert to rescue us from this, we will be of the ones who are thankful","6:64":"Say: God delivers you from them and from every distress. And, again, you ascribe partners with Him","6:65":"Say: He is The One Who Has Power to raise up on you a punishment from above you, or from beneath your feet or to confuse you as partisans and to cause you to experience the violence of some of you to one another. Look on how We diversify the signs so that perhaps they will understand","6:66":"And thy folk denied it and it is The Truth. Say: I am not a trustee over you","6:67":"For every tiding there is an appointed time. And you will know it","6:68":"And when thou hadst seen those who engage in idle talk about Our signs, then, turn aside from them until they discuss in conversation other than that. And if Satan should cause thee to forget, then, after a reminder, sit not with the folk, the ones who are unjust","6:69":"There is not on those who are Godfearing anything of their reckoning, but a reminder so that perhaps they will be Godfearing","6:70":"Forsake those who took to themselves their way of life as a pastime and as a diversion and whom this present life deluded. But remind with it, the Quran, so that a soul would not be given up to destruction for what it earned. Other than God there is not for it a protector nor an intercessor. And even if it be an equitable equivalent, it will not be taken from it. Those are those who were given up to destruction for what they earned. For them is a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because they had been ungrateful","6:71":"Say: Will we call to other than God what can neither hurt nor profit us? And are we repelled on our heels after God guided us like one whom the satans lured, bewildered in and on the earth although he has companions who call him to the guidance saying: Approach us? Say: Truly, the guidance of God is The Guidance. And we were commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds","6:72":"and to perform the formal prayer and be Godfearing of Him. And it is He to Whom you will be assembled","6:73":"And it is He Who created the heavens and the earth with The Truth. And on a Day He says: Be! Then, it is! His saying is The Truth. And His is the dominion on a Day when the trumpet will be blown. He is One Who Knows of the unseen and the visible. And He is The Wise, The Aware","6:74":"And mention when Abraham said to his father Azar: Hast thou taken idols to thyself as gods? Truly, I see thee and thy folk clearly wandering astray","6:75":"And, thus, We cause Abraham to see the kingdom of the heavens and the earth so that he would be of the ones who are certain in belief","6:76":"So when night outspread over him, he saw a star. He said: This is my Lord. Then, when it set, he said: I love not that which sets","6:77":"Then, when he saw the moon, that which rises, he said: This is my Lord. Then, when it set, he said: If my Lord guides me not, certainly, I would have been among the folk, the ones gone astray","6:78":"Then, when he saw the sun, that which rises, he said: This is my Lord. This is greater. Then, when it set, he said: O my folk! Truly, I am free from the partners you ascribe with Him","6:79":"Truly, I turned my face to He Who Originated the heavens and the earth—as a monotheist and I am not of the ones who are polytheists","6:80":"And his folk argued with him. He said: You argue with me about God while, surely, He guided me? I fear not whatever partners you ascribe with Him. When my Lord wills a thing, my Lord encompassed everything in His knowledge. Will you not, then, recollect","6:81":"And how should I fear what you ascribed as partners with Him while you fear not that you ascribe as partners with God? He sends not down to you any authority for it. Then, which of the two groups of people has better right to a place of sanctuary if you had been knowing","6:82":"Those who believed and confuse not their belief with injustice, those, to them belongs the place of sanctuary. And they are ones who are truly guided","6:83":"And that was Our disputation that We gave Abraham against his folk. We exalt in degrees whom We will, truly, thy Lord is Wise, Knowing","6:84":"And We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob. Each of them We guided. And Noah We guided before and among his offspring are David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. And, thus, We gave recompense to the ones who are doers of good","6:85":"And Zechariah and Yahya and Jesus and Elijah—all are among the ones in accord with morality","6:86":"And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot. We gave all an advantage over the worlds","6:87":"And from among their fathers and their offspring and their brothers/sisters, We elected them and We guided them to a straight path","6:88":"That is guidance of God. He guides with it whom He wills of His servants. And if they ascribed partners with Him, what they had been doing was fruitless for them","6:89":"Those are those to whom We gave the Book and critical judgment and prophethood. So if these are ungrateful for them, then, surely, We charged a folk with them who is not of the ones who are ungrateful for them","6:90":"Those are those whom God guided. So imitate their guidance. Say: I ask of you no compensation for it. It is not but a reminder for the worlds","6:91":"And they measured not God with His true measure when they said: God caused not to descend anything to a mortal. Say: Who caused the Book to descend that was brought about for Moses as a light and guidance for humanity? You make it into parchments. You show them some of it and conceal much of it. And you were taught what you know not, you nor your fathers. Say: God revealed it. Again, forsake them playing, engaging in their idle talk","6:92":"And this is a Book We caused to descend—that which is blessed—and that which establishes as true what was before it and for thee to warn the Mother of Towns and who are around it and those who believe in the world to come believe in it. And they over their formal prayers are watchful","6:93":"And who does greater wrong than he who devised lies against God or said: It was revealed to me, when nothing is revealed to him. Or who said: I will cause to descend the like of what God caused to descend. And if thou wouldst see when the ones who are unjust are in the perplexity of death and the angels—the ones who stretch out their hands will say: Relinquish your souls. Today, you will be given recompense with the humiliating punishment for what you had been saying about God other than The Truth. And you had been growing arrogant to His signs","6:94":"And, certainly, you drew near Us one by one as We created you the first time. And you left what We granted you behind your backs. We see not your intercessors with you, those whom you claimed as your ascribed associates. Certainly, the bonds between you were cut asunder. And gone astray from you is what you had been claiming","6:95":"Truly, it is God who is One Who Causes to Break Forth the grain and the pit of a date. He brings out the living from the dead and is One Who Brings Out the dead from the living. That is God. Then, how you are misled","6:96":"He is One Who Causes to Break Forth the morning dawn and He made the night as a place of comfort and rest and the sun and the moon to keep count. That is the foreordaining of The Almighty, The Knowing","6:97":"And it is He Who made the stars for you so that you will be truly guided by them in the shadows of dry land and the sea. Surely, We explained distinctly the signs for a folk who know","6:98":"And it is He Who caused you to grow from a single soul, then, a temporary stay and a repository. Surely, We explained distinctly the signs for a folk who understand","6:99":"And it is He Who caused to descend water from heaven. Then, We brought out from it every kind of bringing forth. Then, We brought out herbs from it. We bring out from it thick-clustered grain and from the date palm tree, from the spathe of it, thick clusters of dates, that which draws near and gardens of the grapevines and the olives and the pomegranates, like each to each and not resembling one another. Look on its fruit when it bore fruit and its ripening. Truly, in this are signs for a folk who believe","6:100":"And they made as associates with God—the jinn—although He created them. And they falsely attributed to Him sons and daughters without knowledge. Glory be to Him! Exalted is He above what they allege","6:101":"He is Beginner of the heavens and the earth. How would He have a child when He is without a companion and He created everything and He is Knowing of everything","6:102":"That is God, your Lord. There is no god but He—the One Who is Creator of everything—so worship Him. For He is Trustee over everything","6:103":"No sight overtakes Him, but He overtakes sight. And He is The Subtle, The Aware","6:104":"Surely, clear evidence drew near you from your Lord. So whoever perceived, it will be for his own soul. Whoever was in darkness will be against his own soul. Say: And I am not a guardian over you","6:105":"And, thus, We diversify the signs and they will say: Thou hadst received instruction and We will make the Quran manifest for a folk who know","6:106":"Follow thou what was revealed to thee from thy Lord. There is no god but He. Turn thou aside from the ones who are polytheists","6:107":"And if God willed, they would not have ascribed partners with Him, We made thee not a guardian over them, nor art thou a trustee for them","6:108":"And offend not those who call to other than God so that they not offend God out of spite without knowledge. Thus, We made to appear pleasing the actions of every community. Again, to their Lord is their return. Then, He will tell them what they had been doing","6:109":"And they swear by God the most earnest sworn oaths that if a sign would draw near them, they would, certainly, believe in it.

And what will cause you to realize that even if the signs were to draw near, they would not believe","6:110":"We will turn around and around their minds and their sight as they believe not in it the first time. And We will forsake them in their defiance, wandering unwilling to see","6:111":"And even if We sent down the angels to them and the dead spoke to them and we assembled everything against them, face to face, yet they would not believe unless God wills, except many of them are ignorant","6:112":"And, thus, We made an enemy for every Prophet, satans from among humankind and the jinn. Some of them reveal to some others an ornamented saying, a delusion. And if thy Lord willed, they would not have accomplished it. So forsake them and what they devise","6:113":"while minds will bend towards it of those who believe not in the world to come and they will be well-pleased with it. And they will gain what the ones who gain gain","6:114":"Will I be looking for an arbiter other than God while it is He Who caused to descend to you the Book, one that is distinct? And those to whom We gave the Book, they know that it is one that is sent down by thy Lord with The Truth. So thou hast not been among the ones who contest","6:115":"Completed was the Word of thy Lord in sincerity and justice. There is no one who changes His Words. And He is The Hearing, The Knowing","6:116":"And if thou hast obeyed most of who are on the earth, they will cause thee to go astray from the way of God. They follow nothing but opinion and they only guess","6:117":"Truly, thy Lord is He Who is greater in knowledge of who goes astray from His way. And He is greater in knowledge of the ones who are truly guided","6:118":"So eat of that over which the Name of God was remembered if you had been ones who believe in His signs","6:119":"And why should you not eat of that over which the Name of God was remembered on it? Surely, He explained distinctly to you what He forbade to you unless you were driven by necessity to it. And, truly, many cause others to go astray by their desires without knowledge. Truly, thy Lord, He is greater in knowledge of the ones who exceed the limits","6:120":"And forsake manifest sin and its inward part. Truly, those who earn sin, they will be given recompense for what they had been gaining","6:121":"Eat not of that over which the Name of God is not remembered on it.

Yet they plan not but against themselves although they are not aware","6:124":"And when a sign drew near them they said: We will not believe until we are given the like of what was given to Messengers of God.• God is greater in knowledge where to assign His message. On those who sinned will light contempt from God and a severe punishment for what they had been planning","6:125":"And whomever God wants, He guides him. He expands his breast for The Submission to One God. And whomever He wants to cause to go astray, He makes his breast tight, troubling, as if he had been climbing up a difficult ascent. Thus, God assigns disgrace on those who believe not","6:126":"And this is the path of thy Lord, one that is straight. Surely, We explained distinctly the signs for a folk who recollect","6:127":"For them is the abode of peace with their Lord. And He is their protector for what they had been doing","6:128":"And mention on a Day He will assemble them altogether. O assembly of the jinn! Surely, you acquired much from humankind. And their protectors among humankind would say: Our Lord! Some of us enjoyed some others and we reached our term that was appointed by Thee for us. He would say: The fire is your place of lodging, ones who will dwell in it forever, but what God willed. Truly, thy Lord is Wise, Knowing","6:129":"And, thus, that is how We make some of them friends with some others who are ones who are unjust to one another for what they had been earning","6:130":"O assembly of jinn and humankind! Approach not Messengers from among yourselves relating to you My signs, and warning you of the meeting of this, your Day? They said: We bore witness against ourselves.

And thy Lord is not One Who is Heedless of what they do","6:133":"Thy Lord is The Sufficient, Possessor of Mercy.

Act according to your ability. Truly, I too am one who acts. Then, you will know for whom the Ultimate End will be the abode. Truly, the ones who are unjust will not prosper","6:136":"And they assigned to God of what He made numerous of cultivation and flocks a share. Then, they said in their claim: This is for God and this is for our ascribed associates.

He will give recompense to them for their allegations. Truly, He is Wise, Knowing","6:140":"They, surely, lost those who foolishly kill their children without knowledge. They forbade what God provided them in a devising against God. They, surely, went astray and had not been ones who are truly guided","6:141":"And it is He Who caused gardens to grow, trellised and without being trellised and the date palm trees and a variety of harvest crops and the olives and the pomegranates resembling and not resembling one another. Eat of its fruit when it bore fruit and give its due on the day of its reaping and exceed not all bounds.

Truly, God guides not the folk, the ones who are unjust","6:145":"Say: I find not in what was revealed to me to taste that which is forbidden to taste, but that it be carrion or blood, that which is shed or the flesh of swine for that, truly, is a disgrace or was hallowed—contrary to moral law—to other than God on it. Then, whoever was driven by necessity other than being one who is willfully disobedient or one who turns away. Then, truly, thy Lord is Forgiving, Compassionate","6:146":"And to those who became Jews, We forbade every possessor of claws. And of the cows and the herd of sheep, We forbade them their fat, but what their backs carried or entrails or what mingled with bone.

And His might is not repelled from the folk, ones who sin","6:148":"Those who ascribed partners with God will say: If God willed, neither would we have ascribed partners with God, nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything.

You follow not but opinion and, then, you only guess","6:149":"Say: God has the conclusive disputation. And if He willed, He would have guided you one and all","6:150":"Say: Come on!

Surely, We caused to descend to you garments to cover up your intimate parts and finery, but the garment of God-consciousness, that is better. That is of the signs of God so that perhaps they will recollect","7:27":"O Children of Adam! Let not Satan tempt you as he drove your parents out of the Garden, tearing off their garments from both of them to cause them to see their intimate parts. Truly, he and his type sees you whereas you see them not. Truly, We made he and the satans protectors of those who believe not","7:28":"And when they committed an indecency, they said: We found our fathers on it and God commanded us in it. Say: Truly, God commands not depravities. Say you about God what you know not","7:29":"Say: My Lord commanded me to equity. And set your faces at every place of prostration and call to Him ones who are sincere and devoted in the way of life to Him. As He began you, you will revert to Him","7:30":"He guided a group of people and a group of people realized their fallacy. Truly, they took satans to themselves as protectors instead of God and they assume that they are ones who are truly guided","7:31":"O Children of Adam! Take your adornment at every place of prostration. And eat and drink, but exceed not all bounds. Truly, He loves not the ones who are excessive","7:32":"Say: Who forbade the adornment of God that He brought out for His servants. And what is the good of His provision? Say: They are for those who believed in this present life and, exclusively, on the Day of Resurrection. Thus, We explain distinctly the signs for a folk who know","7:33":"Say: My Lord forbade not but indecencies—what was manifest or what was inward—and sins and unrightful insolence, to ascribe partners with God when He sends not down for it any authority and that you say about God what you know not","7:34":"And for every community there is a term. And when their term drew near, they will not delay it by an hour, nor press it forward","7:35":"O Children of Adam! If Messengers from among you approach relating My signs to you, then, whoever was Godfearing and made things right, then, there will be neither fear in them nor will they feel remorse","7:36":"But those who denied Our signs and grew arrogant against them, those are the Companions of the Fire; they are ones who will dwell in it forever","7:37":"Then, who does greater wrong than he who devised a lie against God or denied His signs? Those, they will attain their share from the Book. Until Our Messengers drew near to gather them to themselves, they will say: Where are who you had been calling on other than God? They will say: They went astray from us. And they bore witness against themselves that, truly, they had been ones who are ungrateful","7:38":"He will say: Enter among the communities that passed away before you of jinn and humankind into the fire. Every time a community entered, it would curse its sister community until when they will come successively in it altogether. The last of them would say to the first of them: Our Lord! These caused us to go astray so give them a double punishment of the fire. He will say: For everyone it is double except you know not","7:39":"And the first of them would say to the last of them: You have had no superiority over us so experience the punishment for what you had been earning","7:40":"Truly, those who denied Our signs and grew arrogant among them, the doors of heaven will not be opened up to them nor will they enter the Garden until a he-camel penetrates through the eye of the needle. And, thus, We give recompense to the ones who sin","7:41":"For them hell will be their cradling and above them, the overwhelming event. Thus, We give recompense to the ones who are unjust","7:42":"But for those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, We place no burden on any soul beyond its capacity. Those will be the Companions of the Garden. They are ones who will dwell in it forever","7:43":"And We will draw out what was in their breasts of grudges. And rivers will run beneath them. And they will say: The Praise belongs to God Who truly guided us to this! And we would not have been guided if God guided us not. Certainly, the Messengers of our Lord drew near us with The Truth. And it was proclaimed to them that this, the Garden, was given to you as inheritance for what you had been doing","7:44":"And the Companions of the Garden would cry out to the Companions of the Fire: Surely, we found what our Lord promised us to be true. Found you not what your Lord promised to be true? They would say: Yes. Then, it will be announced by one who announces among them: May the curse of God be on the ones who are unjust","7:45":"those who bar the way of God and who desire it to be crooked. And in the world to come they will be ones who are ungrateful","7:46":"And between them both is a partition. And on the Elevated Places will be men who recognize everyone by their mark. And they will cry out to the Companions of the Garden that: Peace be on you. They enter it not and they are desirous of it","7:47":"And when their sight would be turned away of its own accord to the Companions of the Fire, they will say: Our Lord assign Thou us not with the folk, ones who are unjust","7:48":"The Companions of the Elevated Places would cry out to men whom they would recognize by their mark. They would say: Your amassing availed you not, nor that you had been growing arrogant","7:49":"Are these, those about whom you swore an oath that God would never impart mercy? Enter the Garden. There will be neither fear in you nor will you feel remorse","7:50":"And the Companions of the Fire would cry out to the Companions of the Garden: Pour some water on us, or some of what God provided you. They would say: Truly, God forbade them both to the ones who are ungrateful","7:51":"those who took their way of life to themselves as a diversion and as a pastime. This present life deluded them. So today We will forget them as they forgot the meeting of this their Day and because they had been negating Our signs","7:52":"And, surely, We brought about a Book to them in which We explained distinctly, with knowledge, a guidance and a mercy for a folk who believe","7:53":"Did they look on for nothing but its interpretation? The Day its interpretation approaches, those who forgot it before will say: Surely, Messengers of our Lord drew near us with The Truth. Have we any intercessors who will intercede for us? Or will we be returned so we do other than what we had been doing before? Surely, they lost themselves. Went astray from them what they had been devising","7:54":"Truly, your Lord is God, He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days. Again, He turned His attention to the Throne. He covers the nighttime with the daytime that seeks it out urgently. And the sun and the moon and the stars are ones caused to be subservient to His command. Truly, His is not but the creation and the command. Blessed be God, Lord of the worlds","7:55":"Call to your Lord humbly and inwardly. Truly, He loves not the ones who exceed the limits","7:56":"Make not corruption in the earth after things were made right and call to Him with fear and hope. Truly, the mercy of God is Near to the ones who are doers of good","7:57":"And it is He Who sends the winds, ones that are bearers of good news before His mercy until when they were charged with heavy clouds. We will drive it to a dead land. Then, We caused water to descend from the cloud and with it We bring out by water all kinds of fruits. Thus, We bring out the dead so that perhaps you will recollect","7:58":"As for the good land, its plants go forth with permission of its Lord. While, as for what was bad, it goes forth not but scantily. Thus, We diversify the signs for a folk who give thanks","7:59":"Surely, We sent Noah to his folk. And he said: O my folk! Worship God! You have no god other than He. Truly, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day","7:60":"The Council of his folk said: Truly, we see thee clearly wandering astray","7:61":"He said: O my folk! There is no fallacy in me. I am only a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds","7:62":"I state the messages of my Lord to you and advise you and I know from God what you know not","7:63":"Or marveled you that there drew near you a remembrance from your Lord through a man among you that he warn you and that you be Godfearing so that perhaps you will find mercy","7:64":"Then, they denied him. Then, We rescued him and those who were with him on the boat and We drowned those who denied Our signs. Truly, they, they had been a folk in the dark","7:65":"And to Ad, God sent their brother Hud. He said: O my folk! Worship God. You have no god but He. Will you not, then, be Godfearing","7:66":"The Council of those who were ungrateful said among his folk: Truly, we see foolishness in thee. And, truly, we think that thou art among the ones who lie","7:67":"He said: O my folk! There is no foolishness in me. I am only a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds","7:68":"I state the messages of my Lord to you and I am one who gives advice to you, trustworthy","7:69":"Or marveled you that there drew near you a remembrance from your Lord through a man from among you that he may warn you? And remember when He made you viceregents after the folk of Noah and increased you greatly in constitution? Then, remember the benefits of God so that perhaps you will prosper","7:70":"They said: Hast thou brought about to us that we should worship God alone and forsake what our fathers had been worshipping? So approach us with what thou hast promised us if thou hadst been among the ones who are sincere","7:71":"He said: Surely, fell on you disgrace and anger from your Lord. Dispute you with me over names which you named, you and your fathers, for which God sent not down any authority? Then, wait awhile. Truly, I will be with you among the ones who are waiting awhile","7:72":"Then, We rescued him and those with him by a mercy from Us. And We severed the last remnant of those who denied Our signs. And they had not been ones who believe","7:73":"And to Thamud God sent their brother Salih. He said: O my folk! Worship God! You have no god but He. Surely, drew near you clear portents from your Lord. This is the she-camel of God as a sign so allow her to eat on the earth of God and afflict her not with evil so a painful punishment not take you","7:74":"And remember when He made you viceregents after Ad and placed you on the earth. You take to yourselves palaces on the plains and carve out the mountains as houses. So remember the benefits of God. And do no mischief as ones who make corruption in and on the earth","7:75":"Said the Council of those who grew arrogant among his folk to those who were taken advantage of due to their weakness, to those who believed among them: Know you that Salih is one who is sent from his Lord? They said: Truly, in what he was sent, we are ones who believe","7:76":"Those who grew arrogant said: Truly, we are in what you believed, ones who disbelieve","7:77":"Then, they crippled the she-camel and defied the command of their Lord and they said: O Salih! Approach us with what thou hast promised us if thou hadst been among the ones who are sent","7:78":"So the quaking of the earth took them. And it came to be in the morning they were in their abodes ones who are fallen prostrate","7:79":"Then, he turned away from them and said: O my folk! Certainly, I expressed to you the message of my Lord and advised you, except you love not the ones who give advice","7:80":"And mention Lot, when he said to his folk: You approach indecency as preceded you not anyone therein in the worlds","7:81":"Truly, you, you approach men with lust instead of women? Nay! You are a folk, ones who are excessive","7:82":"And the answer of his folk had not been but that they said: Bring them out from your town. Truly, they are a clan to cleanse themselves","7:83":"Then, We rescued him and his people, but his woman. She had been among the ones who stay behind","7:84":"And We rained down a rain on them. So look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who sin","7:85":"And to Midian God sent their brother Shuayb. He said: O my folk! Worship God! You have no god other than He. Surely, a clear portent drew near you from your Lord so live up to the full measure and the balance and diminish not the things of humanity nor make corruption in and on the earth after things were made right. That will be better for you if you had been ones who believe","7:86":"And sit not by every path intimidating and barring from the way of God those who believed in Him and you desire it to be crooked. And remember when you had been few and He augmented you. And look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who make corruption","7:87":"And if there had been a section of you who believed in what I was sent with and a section believe not, have patience until God gives judgment between us. And He is Best of the ones who judge","7:88":"Said the Council of those who grew arrogant from among his folk: O Shuayb! We will, certainly, drive thee out—and those who believed with thee—from our town or else you revert to our creed. He said: Even if we had been ones who dislike it","7:89":"Surely, we would have devised a lie against God if we reverted to your creed after God delivered us from it. And it will not be for us that we revert to it unless God, our Lord, wills. Our Lord encompassed everything in knowledge. In God we put our trust. Our Lord! Give victory between us and between our folk in Truth and Thou art Best of the ones who are deliverers","7:90":"But said the Council of those who were ungrateful among his folk: If you followed Shuayb, then, truly, you will be ones who are losers","7:91":"Then, the quaking of the earth took them and they came to be in the morning ones who are fallen prostrate in their abodes","7:92":"Those who denied Shuayb had been as if they had not dwelt in them. Those who denied Shuayb they, they had been the ones who were losers","7:93":"So he turned away from them and said: O my folk! Certainly, I expressed to you the messages of my Lord and I advised you. Then, how should I grieve for a folk, ones who are ungrateful","7:94":"And We sent not any Prophet to a town, but We took its people with tribulation and desolation so that perhaps they will lower themselves","7:95":"Again, We substituted in place of evil deeds, benevolence, until they exceeded in number and they said: Surely, our fathers were touched by tribulation and gladness. Then, We took them suddenly while they are not aware","7:96":"And if the people of the towns believed and were Godfearing, We would have opened blessings for them from the heaven and the earth, except they denied. So We took them for what they had been earning","7:97":"Were, then, the people of the towns safe when Our might approaches them at night while they are ones who sleep","7:98":"Or were the people of the towns safe when Our might approaches them in the forenoon while they play","7:99":"Were they safe from the planning of God? No one deems himself safe from the planning of God but the folk, the ones who are losers","7:100":"Guides not those who inherit the earth after its previous people that if We will, We would light on them for their impieties, and We set a seal on their hearts so they hear not","7:101":"These are the towns. Their tidings We relate to thee. And, certainly, their Messengers drew near them with the clear portents. But they had not been believing in what they denied before. Thus, God set a seal on the hearts of the ones who are ungrateful","7:102":"And We found not in many of them any compact. And, truly, We found many of them are ones who disobey","7:103":"Again, We raised up Moses after them with Our signs to Pharaoh and his Council, but they did wrong to them. So look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who make corruption","7:104":"And Moses said: O Pharaoh! Truly, I am a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds","7:105":"I am approved on condition that I say nothing but The Truth about God. Surely, I drew near you with a clear portent from your Lord. So send the Children of Israel with me","7:106":"Pharaoh said: If thou hadst been drawing near with a sign, then, approach with it if thou hadst been among the ones who are sincere","7:107":"Then, Moses cast his staff. That is when it became a clear serpent","7:108":"And he drew out his hand. That is when it was shimmering white to the ones who look","7:109":"The Council of the folk of Pharaoh said: Truly, this is a knowing sorcerer","7:110":"He wants to drive you out from your region so what is your command","7:111":"They said: Put him and his brother off and send to the cities to the place where ones who assemble are","7:112":"Let them approach thee with every knowing sorcerer","7:113":"And the ones who are sorcerers drew near to Pharaoh. They said: Truly, would we have compensation if we had been the ones who are victors","7:114":"Pharaoh said: Yes! And, truly, you will be of the ones who are brought near to me","7:115":"They said: O Moses! Either thou cast, or will we be the ones who cast","7:116":"He said: You cast. So when they cast, they cast a spell on the eyes of the personages and terrified them. And a tremendous sorcery drew near","7:117":"And We revealed to Moses that: Cast thy staff. That is when it swallowed what they faked","7:118":"Thus, The Truth came to pass and proved false what they had been doing","7:119":"So they were vanquished there and turned about as ones who are disgraced","7:120":"The ones who are sorcerers were made to fall down as ones who prostrate themselves","7:121":"They said: We believed in the Lord of the worlds","7:122":"the Lord of Moses and Aaron","7:123":"Pharaoh said: You believed in Him before I give permission to you. Truly, this is a plan you planned in the city that you drive out the people from it but you will know","7:124":"I will, certainly, cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides. Again, I will cause you to be crucified, one and all","7:125":"They said: Truly, we are ones who are turning to our Lord","7:126":"Thou hast sought revenge on us only because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they drew near us. Our Lord! Pour out patience on us and call us to Thyself as ones who submit to God","7:127":"And the Council of the folk of Pharaoh said: Wilt thou forsake Moses and his folk to make corruption in and on the earth while they forsake thee and thy gods? Pharaoh said: We will slay their children and we will save alive their women. And truly, we are ones who are ascendant over them","7:128":"Moses said to his folk: Pray for help from God and have patience. Truly, the earth belongs to God. He gives it as inheritance to whom He wills of His servants. And that is the Ultimate End for the ones who are Godfearing","7:129":"They said: We were maligned before thou hast approached us and after thou hast drawn near to us. He said: Perhaps your Lord will cause your enemy to perish and make you successors to him on the earth so that He will look on how you do","7:130":"And, certainly, We took the people of Pharaoh with years of diminution of fruits, so that perhaps they will recollect","7:131":"And when benevolence drew near them, they would say: This belongs to us. But if an evil deed lights on them, they augur ill of Moses and who were with him. Certainly, that which are their omens are with God except most of them know not","7:132":"And they said: Whatever sign thou hast brought to us to cast a spell on us with it, we will not be ones who believe in thee","7:133":"Then, We sent on them the deluge and the locusts and the lice and the frogs and blood as distinct signs, but they grew arrogant and they had been a folk, ones who sin","7:134":"And when the wrath fell on them, they said: O Moses! Call to thy Lord for us because of the compact made with thee. If thou wert to remove the wrath from us, we would, certainly, believe in thee. And we will send the Children of Israel with thee","7:135":"But when We removed the wrath from them for a term, that which is conclusive, they break their oath","7:136":"So We requited them and drowned them in the water of the sea because they denied Our signs and they had been ones who are heedless of them","7:137":"And We gave as inheritance to the folk who had been taken advantage of due to their weakness, the east of the region and its west which We blessed. And completed was the fairer Word of thy Lord for the Children of Israel because they endured patiently. And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his folk had been crafting and what they had been constructing","7:138":"And We brought the Children of Israel over the sea. Then, they approached on a folk who give themselves up to their idols. They said: O Moses! Make for us a god like the gods they have. He said: Truly, you are an ignorant folk","7:139":"Truly, these are the ones who are ruined and falsehood is what they had been doing","7:140":"He said: Should I look for any god other than God for you while He gave you an advantage over the worlds","7:141":"Mention when We rescued you from the people of Pharaoh who cause an affliction to befall you of a dire punishment. They slay your children and save alive your women. And in that was a trial for you from your Lord, tremendous","7:142":"And We appointed thirty nights for Moses. And We completed them with ten more. Thus, fulfilled was the time appointed by his Lord of forty nights. And Moses said to his brother, Aaron: Be my successor among my folk and make things right and follow not the way of the ones who make corruption","7:143":"And when Moses drew near Our time appointed and his Lord spoke to him, he said: O my Lord! Cause me to see that I look on Thee. He said: Thou wilt never see Me but look on the mountain. Then, if it stayed fast in its place, then, thou wilt see Me. Then, when his Lord Self-disclosed to the mountain, He made it as ground powder and Moses fell down swooning. And when he recovered he said: Glory be to Thee! I repented to Thee and I am the first of the ones who believe","7:144":"He said: O Moses! Truly, I favored thee above humanity by My messages and by My assertion. So take what I gave thee and be among the ones who are thankful","7:145":"And We wrote down for him on the Tablets something of all things and an admonishment and a decisive explanation of all things. So take these with firmness and command thy folk to take what is fairer. I will cause you to see the abodes of the ones who disobey","7:146":"I will turn away from My signs those who increase in pride on the earth without right. And if they see every sign, they believe not in it. And if they see the way of right judgment, yet they will not take that way to themselves. But if they see the way of error, they will take themselves to that way. That is because they denied Our signs and had been ones who are heedless of them","7:147":"And as for those who denied Our signs and the meeting in the world to come, their actions were fruitless. Will they be given recompense but for what they had been doing","7:148":"And the folk of Moses took to themselves after him from out of their glitter a calf, a lifeless body like one that has the lowing sound of flocks. See they not that it neither speaks to them nor guides them to a Way?• Yet they took it to themselves. And they had been the ones who are unjust","7:149":"And when they became ones who are remorseful and saw that they, surely, went astray, they said: If our Lord not have mercy on us and forgive us, we will, certainly, be among the ones who are losers","7:150":"And when Moses returned to his folk enraged, grieved, he said: Miserable was what you succeeded in after me. Would you hasten the command of your Lord? And he cast down the Tablets. He took his brother by his head, pulling him to himself. Aaron said: O son of my mother, truly, the folk took advantage of my weakness and are about to kill me. So let not my enemies gloat over me and assign me not with the folk, the ones who are unjust","7:151":"Moses said: Lord! Forgive me and my brother and cause us to enter into Thy mercy for Thou art One Who is Most Merciful of the ones who are merciful","7:152":"Those who took the calf to themselves attain anger from their Lord and abasement in this present life. And, thus, We give recompense to the ones who devise","7:153":"But those who did evil deeds and repented and, again, believed, truly, thy Lord, after that, will be Forgiving, Compassionate","7:154":"And when the anger subsided in Moses, he took the Tablets. There was guidance and mercy in their inscription for those, they who have reverence for their Lord","7:155":"And Moses chose of his folk seventy men for Our time appointed. And when the quaking of the earth took them, he said: Lord! If Thou wilt, Thou wouldst cause them to perish and me before. Wouldst Thou cause us to perish for what the foolish among us accomplished? It is not but Thy test. With it Thou wilt cause to go astray whom Thou wilt and Thou wilt guide whom Thou hadst willed. Thou art our protector, so forgive us and have mercy on us for Thou art Best of the ones who forgive","7:156":"And prescribe for us in the present benevolence and in the world to come. Truly we turned back to Thee. He said: I light My punishment on whom I will and My mercy encompassed everything. Then, I will prescribe it for those who are Godfearing and give the purifying alms and those, they who believe in Our signs","7:157":"those who follow the Messenger—the unlettered Prophet—whom they will find with them that which is a writing in the Torah and the Gospel. He commands them to that which is honorable and prohibits them from that which is unlawful. And He permits to them what is good and forbids them from deeds of corruption. And He lays down for them severe tests, and the yokes that had been on them. So those who believed in him and supported him and helped him and followed the light that was caused to descend to him, those, they are the ones who prosper","7:158":"Say: O humanity! Truly, I am the Messenger of God to you all of Him to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He. He gives life and He causes to die. So believe in God and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in God and His words and follow him so that perhaps you will be truly guided","7:159":"And among the folk of Moses there is a community that guides with The Truth and by it is just","7:160":"And We sundered them into twelve tribes as communities. And We revealed to Moses when his folk asked him for water: Strike the rock with thy staff. Then, burst forth out of it twelve springs: Surely, each clan knew its drinking place. And We shaded them with cloud shadows. We caused to descend manna and the quails for them. Eat of what is good that We provided you! And they did not wrong Us, but they had been doing wrong to themselves","7:161":"And mention when it was said to them: Inhabit this town and eat from it wherever you willed. Say: Unburden us of sin! And enter the door as ones who prostrate themselves We will forgive you your transgressions. We will increase the ones who are doers of good","7:162":"But among those who did wrong, they substituted a saying other than what was said to them. Then, We sent wrath from heaven because they had been doing wrong","7:163":"And ask them about the town—that which had been bordering the sea— when they disregarded the Sabbath, when their great fish would approach them on the day of the Sabbath, one that was visible on the shore. And the day they keep not the Sabbath, they approach them not. Thus, We try them because they had been disobeying","7:164":"And mention when a community of them said: Why admonish a folk whom God is One Who Causes them to Perish or One Who Punishes them with a severe punishment. They said: To be free from guilt before your Lord and so that perhaps they will be Godfearing","7:165":"So when they forgot of what they were reminded, We rescued those who prohibited evil and We took those who did wrong with a terrifying punishment because they had been disobeying","7:166":"Then, when they defied what they were prohibited We said to them: Be you apes, ones who are driven away","7:167":"And mention when thy Lord caused to be proclaimed that He would, surely, raise up against them until the Day of Resurrection who cause an affliction to befall on them of a dire punishment. Truly, thy Lord is Swift in repayment. And, truly, He is Forgiving, Compassionate","7:168":"And We sundered them in the region into communities. Some of them were the ones in accord with morality and others were other than that. And We tried them with benevolence and evil deeds so that perhaps they will return to obedience","7:169":"Then, after that succeeded successors who inherited the Book. They take advantage of this nearer world, and they say: We will be forgiven. And if an advantage approaches them like it, they will take it. Is not a solemn promise taken from them with the Book that they would say about God only The Truth? And studied they not what is in it, and know that the Last Abode is better for those who are Godfearing? Will you not, then, be reasonable","7:170":"And those who keep fast to the Book and performed the formal prayer, We will not waste the compensation of the ones who make things right","7:171":"Mention when We shook up the mountain over them, as if it had been an overshadowing, and they thought it was that which would fall on them: It was said: Take with firmness what We gave you and remember what is in it so that perhaps you will be Godfearing","7:172":"And mention when thy Lord took from the Children of Adam—from their generative organs—their offspring and called to them to witness of themselves: Am I not your Lord? They said: Yea! ^We bore witness^ so that you say not on the Day of Resurrection: Truly, we had been ones who were heedless of this","7:173":"Or you not say: Our fathers before us ascribed partners with God. We had been offspring after them. Wilt Thou cause us to perish for what the ones who deal in falsehood accomplished","7:174":"And, thus, We explain Our signs distinctly so that perhaps they will return","7:175":"And recount to them the tiding of him to whom We gave Our signs, but he cast himself off from them. So Satan pursued him then, he had been among the ones who are in error","7:176":"And if We willed, We would have exalted him with them, but he inclined towards the earth, and followed his own desires. And his parable is like the parable of a dog. If thou wilt attack it, it pants. Or if thou wilt leave it, it pants. That is the parable of the folk, those who denied Our signs. Then, relate these narratives so that perhaps they will reflect","7:177":"How evil is the parable of the folk who denied Our signs! And they had been doing wrong to themselves","7:178":"Whomever God guides, then, he is one who is truly guided. And whomever He causes to go astray, then, those, they are the ones who are losers","7:179":"And, certainly, We made numerous for hell many of the jinn and humankind.

Those, they are the ones who are heedless","7:180":"To God belongs the Fairer Names, so call to Him by them. And forsake those who blaspheme His Names. They will be given recompense for what they had been doing","7:181":"And of whom We created there is a community that guides with The Truth, and with it, it is just","7:182":"And those who denied Our signs, We will draw them on gradually from where they will not know","7:183":"And I will grant them indulgence for a while.

They command that which is unlawful and prohibit that which is honorable and close their hands. They forgot God so He forgot them. Truly, the ones who are hypocrites, they are the ones who disobey","9:68":"And God promised the males, ones who hypocrites and the females, ones who are hypocrites and the ones who are ungrateful, the fire of hell, ones who will dwell in it forever! It will be enough for them. God cursed them. And for them is an abiding punishment","9:69":"Like those before you who had been with more strength than you and more wealth and children, they enjoyed their apportionment so you enjoyed your apportionment as enjoyed those who were before you their apportionment. And you engaged in idle talk as they engaged in idle talk. As to those, their actions were fruitless in the present and are such in the world to come. And those, they are the ones who are losers","9:70":"Approaches them not the tidings of those before them—the folk of Noah and of Ad and of Thamud, and of a folk of Abraham, and of the Companions of Midian, and that which are cities overthrown? Their Messengers approached them with the clear portents. So it had not been God who did wrong to them, rather, they had been doing wrong to themselves","9:71":"The males, ones who believe and the females, ones who believe, some are protectors of some other.

Struggle with the ones who are ungrateful and the ones who are hypocrites and be thou harsh against them. And their place of shelter will be hell. Miserable will be the Homecoming","9:74":"They swear by God that they said not against the Prophet but, certainly, they said the word of ingratitude and they were ungrateful after their submission to God. And they were about to do something that they never attain. And they sought revenge but that God would enrich them and His Messenger with His grace. And if they repent, it would be better for them. And if they turn away, God will punish them with a painful punishment in the present and in the world to come. And there is not for them on earth either a protector or a helper","9:75":"And of them are some who made a contract with God saying: If He gave us of His grace, we will be charitable and, certainly, we will be among the ones in accord with morality","9:76":"Then, when He gave them of His grace, they were misers with it and turned away and they were ones who turn aside","9:77":"He made the consequence hypocrisy in their hearts until a Day they will meet Him because they broke with God what they promised Him, because they had been lying against Him","9:78":"Know they not that God knows their conspiring secretly and their secret?

And God is Knowing, Wise","9:111":"Truly, God bought from the ones who believe themselves and their properties. For them is the Garden! They fight in the way of God so they kill and are slain.

Rivers will run beneath them in Gardens of Bliss","10:10":"They will be calling out from there: Glory be to Thee, O God! And their greetings in it will be: Peace! And the last of their calling out will be that: The Praise belongs to God the Lord of the worlds","10:11":"And if God is to quicken the worst for humanity, as they would desire to hasten for the good, their term would be decided.

But when We removed his harm from him, he passed by as if he had never been calling to Us for harm that afflicted him. Thus, made to appear pleasing to the ones who are excessive is what they had been doing","10:13":"And, certainly, We caused to perish generations before you when they did wrong while their Messengers drew near with the clear portents, but they had not been such as to believe. Thus, We give recompense to the folk, the ones who sin","10:14":"Again, We made you viceregents on the earth after them that We look on how you would do","10:15":"And when are recounted to them Our signs, clear portents, those who hope not for their meeting with Us said: Bring us a Recitation other than this or substitute it. Say: It be not possible for me to substitute it of my own accord. I follow nothing but what is revealed to me. Truly, I fear if I rebelled against my Lord a punishment on the tremendous Day","10:16":"Say: If God willed, I would not have related it to you nor would He have caused you to recognize it. Surely, I lingered in expectation among you a lifetime before this. Will you not, then, be reasonable","10:17":"So who did greater wrong than he who devised a lie against God or denied His signs? Truly, the ones who sin will not prosper","10:18":"And they worship other than God things that injure them not, nor profit them. And they say: These are our intercessors with God. Say: Are you telling God of what He knows not in the heavens nor in and on the earth? Glory be to Him and exalted is He above partners they ascribe","10:19":"And humanity had not been but one community, but, then, they became at variance. And if it were not for a Word that preceded from thy Lord, it would be decided between them immediately about what they are at variance in it","10:20":"And they say: Why was a sign not caused to descend from his Lord? Say: Truly, the unseen belongs only to God. So wait awhile. Truly, I am with you of the ones who are waiting awhile","10:21":"And when We caused humanity to experience mercy after tribulation afflicted them, that is when they conspired against Our signs. Say: God is Swifter in planning. Truly, Our messengers write down what you plan","10:22":"He it is Who sets you in motion through dry land and the sea until when you had been in boats and they ran them with the good wind and they were glad in it. A tempest wind drew near them. Waves drew near from every place, and they thought that they were enclosed by it.

O humanity, your insolence is only against yourselves, an enjoyment of this present life. Again, to Us is your return. Then, We will tell you what you had been doing","10:24":"The parable of this present life is but like water that We caused to descend from heaven. It mingled with the plants of the earth—from which you eat—humanity and flocks—until when the earth took its ornaments and was decorated and its people thought that, truly, they are ones who have power over it! Our command approached it by nighttime or by daytime. Then, We made it stubble as if it flourished not yesterday. Thus, We explain distinctly the signs for a folk who reflect","10:25":"And God calls to the Abode of Peace and He guides whom He wills to a straight path","10:26":"For those who did good is the fairer and increase. Neither will gloom come over their faces nor abasement. Those are the Companions of the Garden. They are ones who will dwell in it forever","10:27":"And for those who earned evil deeds, the recompense of an evil deed will be its like and abasement will come over them. They will have none but God as One Who Saves from Harm. It is as if their faces were covered with a strip of the night, one in darkness. Those are the Companions of the Fire. They are ones who will dwell in it forever","10:28":"And on a Day We will assemble them altogether. Again, We will say to those who ascribed partners with God: Stay in your place, you and your ascribed associates. Then, We will set a space between them.

We had been of your worship certainly, ones who are heedless","10:30":"There every soul will be tried for what it has did in the past. And they would be returned to God, their Defender, The Truth. And from them will go astray what they had been devising","10:31":"Say: Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Who controls having the ability to hear and sight? And Who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who manages the command? They will, then, say: God! Say: Will you not be Godfearing","10:32":"Such is God, your Lord, The Truth. And what else is there after The Truth but wandering astray. Where, then, turn you away","10:33":"Thus, was the Word of thy Lord realized against those who disobeyed that they will not believe","10:34":"Say: Are there among your ascribed associates with God anyone who begins the creation and, then, causes it to return? Say: God begins the creation. Again, He causes it to return. Then, how you are misled","10:35":"Say: Are there among your ascribed associates with God anyone who guides to The Truth? Say: God guides to The Truth. Has not He who guides to The Truth a better right to be followed than he who guides not unless he himself be guided? What is the matter with you? How you give judgment","10:36":"And most of them follow nothing but opinion. Truly, opinion avails them not against The Truth at all. Truly, God is Knowing of what they accomplish","10:37":"This Recitation had not been devised by other than God because it establishes as true what was before it and as a decisive explanation of the Book. There is no doubt in it. It is from the Lord of the worlds","10:38":"Or they will say: He devised it. Say: Bring a Chapter of the Quran like it and call to whomever you were able—other than God—if you had been ones who are sincere","10:39":"Nay! They denied the knowledge that they comprehend not while approaches them not the interpretation. Thus, those who were before them denied. So look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who are unjust","10:40":"And of them are some who believe in it and of them are some who believe not in it. And thy Lord is greater in knowledge of the ones who make corruption","10:41":"And if they denied thee, then, thou say: For me are my actions and for you are your actions. You are free of what I do and I am free of what you do","10:42":"And among them are some who listen to thee. So hast thou caused someone unwilling to hear, to hear if they had not been reasonable","10:43":"And among them are some who look on thee. So hast thou guided the unwilling to see if they had not been perceiving","10:44":"Truly, God does not wrong humanity at all, but humanity does wrong itself","10:45":"And on a Day He will assemble them as if they had not been lingering in expectation but an hour of the daytime. They will recognize one another among themselves. Surely, those who denied lost the meeting with God and they had not been ones who are truly guided","10:46":"Whether We cause thee to see some of what We promise them or We call thee to Us, then, to Us is their return. Again, God will be witness to what they accomplish","10:47":"Every community has its Messenger. So, then, when their Messenger drew near, it would be decided between them with equity. And they, they will not be wronged","10:48":"And they say: When is this promise if you had been ones who are sincere","10:49":"Say: I control not either hurt or profit for myself, but what God willed. To every community there is a term. When their term draws near, neither will they delay it an hour nor will they press it forward","10:50":"Say: Considered you that if His punishment approached you at nighttime or at daytime, for which portion would the ones who sin be ones who seek to hasten","10:51":"Again, when it falls on you, believed you in it? Now? While you had been seeking to hasten it","10:52":"Again, it would be said to those who did wrong: Experience the infinite punishment! Will you be given recompense but for what you had been earning","10:53":"And they ask thee to be told: Is it true? Say: Yes! By my Lord it is The Truth and you are not ones who frustrate Him","10:54":"And if there would be for every person who did wrong whatever is in or on the earth, he would, certainly, offer it for his ransom. And they would keep secret their self-reproach when they considered the punishment. But it will be decided between them with equity.

No doubt the promise of God is true, but most of them know not","10:56":"It is He Who gives life and causes to die and to Him you will return","10:57":"O humanity! Surely, an admonishment drew near you from your Lord and a healing for what is in the breasts and a guidance and mercy for ones who believe","10:58":"Say: In the grace of God and in His mercy therein let them be glad. That is better than what they gather","10:59":"Say: Considered you from what God caused to descend for you of provision and that you made some of it unlawful and some lawful? Say: Gave God permission to you or devise you against God","10:60":"And what is the opinion of those who devise a lie against God on the Day of Resurrection? Truly, God is Possessor of Grace to humanity, but most of them give not thanks","10:61":"Neither hast thou been on any matter nor hast thou recounted from the Recitation nor are you doing any action but We had been ones who bear witness over you when you press on it. And nothing escapes from thy Lord of the weight of an atom in or on the earth nor in the heaven nor what is smaller than that nor what is greater than that but it is in a clear Book","10:62":"No doubt with the faithful friends of God there will be neither fear in them nor will they feel remorse","10:63":"Those who believed and had been Godfearing","10:64":"for them are good tidings in this present life and in the world to come.

They follow nothing but opinion and they do nothing but guess","10:67":"It is He Who made the nighttime for you so that you rest in it and the daytime for one who perceives. Truly, in this are signs for a folk who hear","10:68":"They said God took to Himself a son. Glory be to Him. He is Sufficient. To Him is whatever is in the heavens and in and on the earth.

Again, there be no cause for doubt in your affair. Again, decide against me and give me no respite","10:72":"Then, if you turned away, I asked you not for any compensation. My compensation is with God. And I was commanded that I be of the ones who submit to God","10:73":"Then, they denied him, so We delivered him and some with him on the boat. And we made them the viceregents while We drowned those who denied Our signs. Then, look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who are warned","10:74":"Again, We raised up Messengers after him to their folk. They drew near them with the clear portents. But they had not been believing in what they had denied before of it. Thus, We set a seal on the hearts of the ones who exceed the limits","10:75":"Again, We raised up after them Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his Council with Our signs. Then, they grew arrogant, and they had been a folk, ones who sin","10:76":"So when The Truth drew near them from Us, they said: Truly, this is clear sorcery","10:77":"Moses said: Say you this about The Truth when it drew near you? Is this sorcery? And the ones who are sorcerers will not prosper","10:78":"They said: Hadst thou drawn near to us to turn us from what we found our fathers on so that the domination on the earth might be for you two? We are not ones who believe in both of you","10:79":"And Pharaoh said: Bring to me every one who is a knowing sorcerer","10:80":"And when the ones who are sorcerers drew near, Moses said to them: Cast down with ones who cast","10:81":"Then, when they cast Moses said: What you brought about is sorcery. Truly, God will render it untrue. Truly, God makes not right the actions of the ones who make corruption","10:82":"And God will verify The Truth by His Words, although the ones who sin disliked it much","10:83":"But none believed Moses but the offspring of his folk because of the fear of Pharaoh and his Council that he persecute them. And, truly, Pharaoh was one who exalted himself on the earth. And he was, truly, of the ones who are excessive","10:84":"And Moses said: O my folk!

When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of degradation in this present life and gave them enjoyment for a while","10:99":"And if thy Lord willed, all would have believed who are on the earth altogether. So wouldst thou compel humanity against their will until they become ones who believe","10:100":"And it would not have been for any person to believe but by the permission of God.

Thus, it is an obligation upon Us to deliver the ones who believe","10:104":"Say: O humanity! If you were in uncertainty as to my way of life, then, I will not worship those whom you worship other than God. Rather, I worship only God Who will call you to Himself.

Truly, I take refuge with Thee so that I not ask Thee of what I am without knowledge. Unless Thou art to forgive me and have mercy on me, I would be of the ones who are losers","11:48":"It was said: O Noah! Get thee down with peace from Us and blessings on thee and on communities from whoever are with thee, and communities to whom We will give enjoyment.

And my Lord will make successors a folk other than you and you will not injure Him at all. Truly, My Lord is Guardian over everything","11:58":"And Our command drew near. We delivered Hud and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us. And We delivered them from a harsh punishment","11:59":"And that was Ad. They negated the signs of their Lord and rebelled against His Messengers. And they followed the command of every haughty and stubborn one","11:60":"And they were pursued in the present life by a curse. And on the Day of Resurrection, no doubt, truly, Ad were ungrateful to their Lord. Away with Ad, a folk of Hud","11:61":"And We sent to Thamud their brother Salih. He said: O my folk! Worship God. You have no god other than He. He caused you to grow from the earth and settled you on it. So ask for His forgiveness. Again, repent to Him. Truly, my Lord is Near, One Who Answers","11:62":"They said: O Salih! Surely, thou hadst been one who is a source of hope to us before this. Hast thou prohibited us that we worship what our fathers worship? And, truly, we are in uncertainty about what thou hast called us to, in grave doubt","11:63":"He said: O my folk! Considered you that I had been with a clear portent from my Lord and that He gave me a mercy from Himself so who, then, would help me against God if I rebelled against Him?

Will I give birth when I am an old woman and this, my husband, is an old man? Truly, this is a strange thing","11:73":"They said: Marvel thou at the command of God? The mercy of God and His blessings be upon you, O People of the House: Truly, He is Worthy of Praise, Glorious","11:74":"And when the panic went from Abraham and the good tidings drew near to him, he disputes with Us for the folk of Lot","11:75":"Truly, Abraham was forbearing, sympathetic, one who turns in repentance","11:76":"O Abraham! Turn aside from this. Truly, the command of thy Lord drew near. And, truly, that which arrives for them is a punishment, one that is not to be repelled","11:77":"And when Our messengers drew near Lot, he was troubled for them and was concerned for them, being distressed. And he said: This is a distressful day","11:78":"Then, drew near his folk, running toward him because they had been doing evil deeds before. He said: O my folk! These are my daughters! They are purer for you. So be Godfearing of God. And cover me not with shame as regards my guests.

And, truly, thou hast known well what we want","11:80":"He said: Would that I had strength against you or take shelter with stauncher support","11:81":"They said: O Lot! Truly, we are Messengers of thy Lord. They will not reach out to thee so set thou forth with thy people in a part of the night and let not any of you look back, but thy woman. Truly, that which lights on them will light on her. Truly, what is promised to them is in the morning.

He said: O my folk! Worship God. You have no god other than He. And reduce not the measuring vessel and balance. Truly, I consider you as good. And, truly, I fear for you the punishment of an Enclosing Day","11:85":"And O my folk! Live up to the measuring vessel and balance in equity. And diminish not of humanity their things. And do no mischief in and on the earth as ones who make corruption","11:86":"God’s abiding wisdom is best for you if you had been ones who believe. And I am not a Guardian over you","11:87":"They said: O Shuayb! Is it that thy formal prayer commands thee that we leave what our fathers worship or that we accomplish not with our possibilities whatever we will? Truly, thou art the forbearing, the well-intentioned","11:88":"He said: O my folk! Considered you that I had been with a clear portent from my Lord. He provided me fairer provision from Himself. And I want not to go against you in what I prohibit you. I want only making things right so far as I was able. And my success is not but from God. In Him I put my trust and to Him I am penitent","11:89":"And O my folk! Let not your breach with me drive you into being lighted on by the like of what lit on a folk of Noah or a folk of Hud or a folk of Salih. And a folk of Lot are not far from you","11:90":"And ask for forgiveness from your Lord. Again, repent to Him. Truly, my Lord is Compassionate, Loving","11:91":"They said: O Shuayb! We understand not much of what thou sayest. And, truly, we see thee weak among us. If it had not been for thy extended family, we would have stoned thee.

Truly, my Lord is One Who Encloses whatever you do","11:93":"O my folk! Act according to your ability and, truly, I am one who acts. You will know to whom approaches a punishment covering him with shame and who, he is one who lies. And be on the watch! Truly, I am watching with you","11:94":"And Our command drew near. We delivered Shuayb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us. And the Cry took those who did wrong. It came to be in the morning in their abodes ones who are fallen prostrate","11:95":"as if they had not been dwelling in them. Away with Midian just as Thamud was done away","11:96":"And, certainly, We sent Moses with Our signs and a clear authority","11:97":"to Pharaoh and his Council but they followed the command of Pharaoh. And the command of Pharaoh was not well-intended","11:98":"He will go before his folk on the Day of Resurrection and they will be led down into the fire. Miserable will be the watering place, that to which they are led down","11:99":"And they were pursued by a curse in this life and on the Day of Resurrection! Miserable will be, the oblation, that which is offered","11:100":"That is from the tidings of the towns that We relate to thee. Of them, some are ones that are standing up and some are stubble","11:101":"And it was not that We did wrong to them. Rather, they did wrong themselves. And their gods availed them not whom they call to besides God at all.

Truly, His taking is painful, severe","11:103":"In that, truly, there is a sign for whoever feared the punishment of the world to come. That Day humanity will be one that is gathered together for it and that will be a witnessed Day","11:104":"And We postpone it not but for the numbered term","11:105":"On the Day it approaches no person will assert anything but with His permission. Then, among them will be the disappointed and the happy","11:106":"As for those who were in despair, they will be in the fire.

They worship nothing but what their fathers worship before. And We are the ones who pay their share in full without being that which is reduced","11:110":"And, certainly, We gave Moses the Book, but they were at variance about it. And if it were not for a Word that preceded from thy Lord, it would be decided between them. And, truly, they were uncertain about it, ones in grave doubt","11:111":"And, truly, to each his account will be paid in full by thy Lord for their actions. Truly, He is Aware of what they do","11:112":"So go thou straight as thou wert commanded and those who repented with thee and be not defiant. Truly, He is Seeing of what you do","11:113":"Then, incline not to those who did wrong so the fire afflict you and there will not be for you any protectors other than God. Again, you will not be helped","11:114":"And perform the formal prayer at the two ends of the daytime and at nearness of the nighttime. Truly, benevolence causes evil deeds to be put away. That is a reminder for the ones who remember","11:115":"And have thou patience, for, truly, God wastes not the compensation of the ones who are doers of good","11:116":"Why had there not been among the generations before you imbued with abiding wisdom, prohibiting corruption in and on the earth, but a few of those whom We rescue from among them?

Truly, I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon. I saw them as ones prostrating themselves to me","12:5":"He said: O my son! Relate not thy dream to thy brothers so that they contrive cunning against thee. Truly, Satan is a clear enemy to the human being","12:6":"And, thus, thy Lord will elect thee and teach thee of the interpretation of events. And He will fulfill His divine blessing on thee and on the people of Jacob just as He fulfilled it on thy two fathers before, Abraham and Isaac. Truly, thy Lord is Knowing, Wise","12:7":"Certainly, there had been in Joseph and his brothers signs for the ones who ask","12:8":"When they said: Certainly, Joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we, although we are many. Truly, our father is clearly wandering astray","12:9":"Kill Joseph or fling him to some other region to free the face of your father for you. You be a folk after that ones in accord with morality","12:10":"Said one who says: Kill not Joseph, but cast him into the bottom of a well. Some company of travelers will pick him out, if you had been ones who do this","12:11":"They said: O our father! Why wilt thou not entrust us with Joseph when we are, truly, ones who will, certainly, look after him","12:12":"Send him with us tomorrow to frolic and play. And, truly, we are ones who guard him","12:13":"He said: Truly, it disheartens me that you go with him. And I fear that a wolf eat him while you are ones who are heedless of him","12:14":"They said: If a wolf ate him while we are many, truly, then, we are ones who are losers","12:15":"So they went with him, and they agreed to lay him in the bottom of the well. And We revealed to him: Certainly, thou wilt tell them of this, their affair, when they are not aware","12:16":"And they drew near their father in the time of night, weeping","12:17":"They said: O our father! Truly, we went racing and we left Joseph with our sustenance and a wolf ate him and thou wilt not be one who believes us, even if we had been ones who are sincere","12:18":"And they brought about his long shirt with false blood. He said: Nay! Your souls enticed you with a command. Having patience is graceful. And it is God, One Whose Help is being sought against what you allege","12:19":"And there drew near a company of travelers so they sent their water-drawer to let down his bucket. He said: What good tidings! This is a boy! So they kept him secret as merchandise. And God is Knowing of what they do","12:20":"And they sold him for a meager price of coins, ones that are numbered. And they had been of him among the ones who hold him in low esteem","12:21":"One from Egypt who bought him said to his woman: Honor him as a guest with a place of lodging. Perhaps he will profit us or we will take him to ourselves as a son. And, thus, We established Joseph firmly in the earth that We teach him the interpretation of events. God is One Who is Victor over His command, except most of humanity knows not","12:22":"And when he had fully grown and come of age, We gave him critical judgment and knowledge. And, thus, We give recompense to the ones who are doers of good","12:23":"And she in whose house he was solicited him, enticing him to evil. And she shut the doors and said: Come thou! He said: God be my safe place. Truly, he, thy husband, is my master and He gave me a goodly place of lodging. Truly, the ones who are unjust will not prosper","12:24":"She, certainly, was about to act on her desire for him and he was about to act on his desire for her, if it were not that he saw proof of his Lord. Thus, it was that We turn away from him evil and depravity. And, truly, he was among Our servants, ones who are devoted","12:25":"So they raced to the door and she tore his long shirt from behind. And they both discovered her chief at the door. She said: What is the recompense of him who wanted evil for thy household, but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment","12:26":"He said: She solicited me, enticing me to evil. And one who bears witness bore witness from her household and said: If his long shirt had been torn from the front, then, she was sincere, and he was among the ones who lie","12:27":"But if his long shirt had been torn from behind, she lied against herself; he was among ones who are sincere","12:28":"When her husband saw his long shirt was torn from behind, he said: It is of your (f) cunning; truly, your (f) cunning is serious","12:29":"Joseph! Turn aside from this! To his wife he said: Ask thou for forgiveness for thy (f) impiety; truly, thou (f) hadst been of the ones who are inequitable","12:30":"And the ladies in the city said: The woman of the great one solicits her spiritual warrior, enticing him to evil. Surely, he captivated her longing. Truly, we consider her to be clearly wandering astray","12:31":"So when she heard of their planning, she sent for them (f), and made ready for them a banquet. And she gave each one of them (f) a knife, and said to Joseph: Go forth before them (f). Then, when they saw him, they admired him and cut their hands. And they (f) said: God save us! This is not a mortal. This is nothing but a generous angel","12:32":"She said: This is he about whom you (f) blamed me. And, certainly, I solicited him, enticing him to evil, but he preserved himself from sin. And now if he accomplishes not what I command, he will, certainly, be imprisoned and will be among the ones who are disgraced","12:33":"He said: O my Lord! Prison is more beloved to me than what they call me to. Unless Thou hast turned away their (f) cunning from me, I will yearn towards them (f) and I will be among the ones who are ignorant","12:34":"So his Lord responded to him and turned away their (f) cunning from him. Truly, He, He is The Hearing, The Knowing","12:35":"Again, it showed itself to them. And after they saw the signs, it seemed that they should imprison him for a while","12:36":"And there entered with him in the prison two male spiritual warriors. One of them said: Truly, I see myself pressing grapes in season. And the other said: Truly, I see myself carrying bread over my head from which birds are eating. They said: Tell us the interpretation of this. Truly, we consider thee among the ones who are doers of good","12:37":"He said: The food you both are provided approaches you not, but I will tell you of its interpretation before it approaches. That is of what my Lord taught me. Truly, I left the creed of a folk who believe not in God and they, in the world to come, they are ones who disbelieve","12:38":"And I followed the creed of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It had not been for us that we ascribe anything as partners with God. That is from the grace of God to us and to humanity, except most of humanity gives not thanks","12:39":"O my two prison companions! Are ones that are different masters better or God, The One, The Omniscient","12:40":"Whomever you worship other than He are nothing but names that you named—you and your fathers for which God caused not to descend any authority. The determination is from God alone. He commanded that you worship none but Him. That is the truth-loving way of life, except most of humanity knows not","12:41":"O my two prison companions! As for one of you, he will give intoxicants to drink to his master. And as for the other, he will be crucified. And birds will eat from his head. The matter was decided about which you ask for advice","12:42":"And he said to the one of them whom he thought should be the one who is saved of the two: Remember me to thy master. Then, Satan caused him to forget the remembrance of him to his master so Joseph lingered in expectation in prison for a certain number of years","12:43":"And the king said: Truly, I, I see seven fattened cows eating seven lean ones and seven ears of green wheat and others dry. O Council: Render an opinion to me about my dream if you had been able to expound dreams","12:44":"They said: Jumbled nightmares. And we are not of the interpretation of nightmares ones who know","12:45":"And said the man of the two of them who was delivered and recalled after a period of time: I will tell you its interpretation so send me","12:46":"Joseph, O thou just person! Render an opinion to us about seven fattened cows eaten by seven lean ones and seven ears of green wheat and others dry so that perhaps I will return to the personages so that perhaps they will know about thee","12:47":"He said: You will sow for seven years in like previous manner and of what you reaped, then, forsake ears of wheat, but a little of it that you may eat","12:48":"Again, seven severe years will approach after that. You will eat what you put forward, but a little of what you keep in store","12:49":"Again, after that, will approach a year in which humanity will be helped with rain and they will press in season","12:50":"And the king said: Bring him to me. Then, when the Messenger brought about, he said: Return to thy master and ask him: What of the ladies, those who cut their hands? Truly, my Lord is Knowing of their (f) cunning","12:51":"He said: What was your (f) business when you solicited Joseph, enticing him to evil? They (f) said: God save us! We knew not any evil against him. The woman of the great one said: Now The Truth was discovered! I sought to solicit him, enticing him to evil. And, truly, he is among the ones who are sincere","12:52":"Joseph said: That is so that the great one know that I betray him not in his absence. And that God guides not the cunning of the ones who are traitors","12:53":"And I declare my soul not innocent. Truly, the soul is that which incites to evil, but when my Lord had mercy. Truly, my Lord is Forgiving, Compassionate","12:54":"And the king said: Bring him to me so that I attach him to myself. Then, when he spoke to him he said: Truly, this day thou art with us secure, trustworthy","12:55":"Joseph said: Assign me over the storehouses of the region. Truly, I will be a knowing guardian","12:56":"And, thus, We established Joseph firmly in the region to take his dwelling in it when or where he wills. We light Our mercy on whom We will and We waste not the compensation of ones who are doers of good","12:57":"Truly, the compensation of the world to come is better for those who believed and had been Godfearing","12:58":"And Joseph’s brothers drew near and they entered before him. He recognized them, but they are ones who know him not","12:59":"And when he equipped them with their food supplies, he said: Bring me a brother of yours from your father. See you not that I live up to full measure and that I am best of the ones who host","12:60":"Then, if you bring him not to me, there will be no full measure for you with me, nor will you come near me","12:61":"They said: We will solicit his father for him and, truly, we are ones who do it","12:62":"And Joseph said to his spiritual warriors: Lay their merchandise into their saddlebags so that perhaps they will recognize it when they turned about to their household so that perhaps they will return","12:63":"So when they returned to their father, they said: O our father! The full measure was refused to us so send our brother with us that we will obtain our measure. And, truly, we will be ones who guard him","12:64":"Jacob said: How will I entrust him to you as I entrusted you with his brother before? But, then, God is Best of One Who Guards. And He is One Who is the Most Merciful of the ones who are the most merciful","12:65":"And when they opened their sustenance, they found their merchandise was returned to them. They said: O our father, this is what we desire. Our merchandise was returned to us and we will get provision for our household and we will keep our brother safe and add a camel’s load of full measure. That is an easy full measure","12:66":"He said: I will not send him with you until you give me a pledge by God that you will bring him back to me, unless you are enclosed yourselves. And when they gave him their pledge, he said: God is Trustee over what we say","12:67":"And he said: O my sons! Enter not by one door, but enter by different doors. I will not avail you against God in anything. Truly, the determination is but with God. In Him I put my trust. And in Him put their trust the ones who put their trust","12:68":"And when they entered from where their father commanded, it had not been availing them against God in anything, but it was a need of Jacob’s inner self which he satisfied. And, truly, he was a possessor of knowledge because We taught him, except most of humanity knows not","12:69":"And when they entered before Joseph, he himself gave refuge to his brother. He said: Truly, I am thy brother, so be not despondent for what they had been doing","12:70":"So when he equipped them with their food supplies, he laid the drinking cup into their brother’s saddlebag. Again, one who announces announced: O you in the caravan! Truly, you are ones who are thieves","12:71":"They said coming forward: What is it that you are missing","12:72":"They said: We are missing the king’s drinking cup and for him who brought it about is a camel’s load and I am the guarantor for it","12:73":"They said: By God, certainly, you knew we drew not near making corruption in the region. And we had not been ones who are thieves","12:74":"They said: What, then, will be the recompense for him if you had been ones who lie","12:75":"They said: The recompense for it will be that he in whose saddlebag it was located will be the recompense. Thus, we give recompense to the ones who are unjust","12:76":"So he began with their sacks before the sack of his brother. Again, he pulled it out of his brother’s sack. Thus, We contrived for Joseph. He would not have taken his brother into the judgment of the king unless God wills it. We exalt in degree whomever We will, and above all those possessors of knowledge is One Who is Knowing","12:77":"They said: If he steals, surely, a brother of his stole before. But Joseph kept it secret within himself, not showing it to them. He said: You are in a worse place. And God is greater in knowledge of what you allege","12:78":"They said: O the great one! Truly, for him is an old man as his father so take one of us in his place. Truly, we consider thee among the ones who are doers of good","12:79":"He said: God be my safe place that we take but him with Whom we found our sustenance. Truly, we, then, would be of the ones who are unjust","12:80":"So when in regard to him they became hopeless, they conferred privately. The eldest of them said: Know you not that your father, surely, took a pledge from you by God and before that you neglected your duty with Joseph. So I will never quit this region until my father gives me permission or God gives judgment in my case. And He is Best of the ones who judge","12:81":"Return to your father and say: O our father! Truly, thy son stole and we bore witness only to what we knew. And we had not been ones who guard the unseen","12:82":"And ask the people of the town where we had been and the people of the caravan in which we came forward. And, truly, we are ones who are sincere","12:83":"He said: You were enticed by your souls into an affair. So patience is graceful. Perhaps God will bring me them altogether. Truly, He, He is The Knowing, The Wise","12:84":"And he turned away from them and said: O my bitterness for Joseph! And his eyes brightened because of the sorrow that was choking him","12:85":"They said: By God! Thou wilt never discontinue remembering Joseph until thou hast ruined thy health. Thou wouldst be among the ones who are perishing","12:86":"He said: I make not complaint of my anguish and sorrow but to God. And I know from God what you know not","12:87":"O my sons! Go and search for Joseph and his brother. And give not up hope of the solace of God. Truly, no one gives up hope of the solace of God but the folk, ones who are ungrateful","12:88":"Then, when they entered to him, they said: O the great one! Harm afflicted us and our household. We drew near merchandise of scant worth so live up to the full measure and be charitable to us. Truly, God gives recompense to the ones who give in charity","12:89":"He said: Knew you what you accomplished with Joseph and his brother when you are ones who are ignorant","12:90":"They said: Art thou, truly, Joseph? He said: I am Joseph and this is my brother. Surely, God showed us grace. Truly, He Who is Godfearing and endures patiently, then, surely, God will not waste the compensation of the ones who are doers of good","12:91":"They said: By God! Certainly, God held thee in greater favor above us. And, truly, we had been ones who are inequitable","12:92":"He said: No censure on you this day. God forgive you. And He is One Who is Most Merciful of the ones who are most merciful","12:93":"Go with this, my long shirt and cast it over the face of my father. He will become seeing. And bring me your household one and all","12:94":"And when they set forward with the caravan their father said: Truly, I find the scent of Joseph if you think me not weak of mind","12:95":"They said: By God! Truly, thou art long possessed by thy wandering astray","12:96":"Then, when the bearer of good tidings drew near, he cast it over his face and he went back, seeing. He said: Did I not say to you, truly, I know from God what you know not","12:97":"They said: O our father! Ask forgiveness for us for our impieties. Truly, we had been ones who are inequitable","12:98":"He said: I will ask forgiveness for you with my Lord. Truly, He, He is The Forgiving, The Compassionate","12:99":"Then, when they entered to Joseph, he gave refuge to his parents and said: Enter Egypt, if God willed, as ones who are safe","12:100":"And he exalted his parents to the throne. And they fell down before him as ones who prostrate themselves. And he said: O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream from before. My Lord has made it a reality. And, surely, He did good to me when He brought me out of the prison and drew you near out of the desert after Satan had sown enmity between me and between my brothers. Truly, my Lord is Subtle in what He wills. Truly, He is The Knowing, The Wise","12:101":"My Lord! Surely, Thou hadst given me of the dominion. Thou hadst taught of the interpretation of events. One Who is Originator of the heavens and the earth, Thou art my protector in the present and in the world to come. Call me to Thyself as one who submits to Thee and cause me to join with the ones in accord with morality","12:102":"That is of the tidings of the unseen that We reveal to thee. And thou hadst not been in their presence when they agreed to their affair. And they plan","12:103":"And most of humanity is not ones who believe, even if thou wert eager","12:104":"Thou hast asked them not for any compensation. It is but a Remembrance to the worlds","12:105":"And how many signs of the heavens and the earth they pass by while they are ones who turn aside from them","12:106":"And most of them believe not in God, but they be ones who are polytheists","12:107":"Were they safe from the approach to them of the overwhelming event of the punishment from God or the approach on them of the Hour suddenly while they are not aware","12:108":"Say: This is my way. I call to God. I and whoever followed me are on clear evidence. And glory be to God! And I am not among the ones who are polytheists","12:109":"And We sent not before thee as Messengers, but men to whom We reveal from among the people of the towns. So journey they not through the earth and look on how had been the Ultimate End of those who were before them? And, truly, the abode of the world to come is better for those who were Godfearing. Will you not, then, be reasonable","12:110":"When the Messengers became hopeless and thought that they were lied against, then, Our help drew near. So We were to deliver whomever We will. And Our Might will not be repelled from the folk, the ones who sin","12:111":"Certainly, there had been in their narratives a lesson for those imbued with intuition. It had not been a discourse that is devised except it established as true what was before and decisively explained everything and is a guidance and a mercy for a folk who believe","13:1":"Alif L[m M\\m R[. That are the signs of the Book, and what were caused to descend to thee from thy Lord is The Truth, except most of humanity believes not]","13:2":"It is He Who exalted the heavens without any pillars so that you see them. Again, He turned his attention to above the Throne. And He caused to become subservient the sun and the moon, each run for a term, that which is determined. He manages the command. He explains distinctly the signs so that perhaps of the meeting with your Lord you would be certain","13:3":"And it is He Who stretched out the earth and made on it firm mountains and rivers. And with all kinds of fruits, he made in it two, a pair. He covers the nighttime with the daytime. Truly, in that are signs for a folk who reflect","13:4":"And in the earth there are strips, that which neighbor one another and gardens of grapevines and plowed lands and date palm trees coming from the same root and not coming from the same root that are given to drink from one water. And We give advantage to some of them over some others in produce. Truly, in these things there are signs for a folk who are reasonable","13:5":"And if thou hast marveled, then, wonder at their saying: When we had been earth dust, will we, truly, be in a new creation? And those are those who were ungrateful to their Lord. Those will have yokes around their necks. And those will be the Companions of the Fire. They, ones who will dwell in it forever","13:6":"And they seek thee to hasten on evil deeds before the benevolence. And, surely, passed away before them exemplary punishments. But, truly, thy Lord is certainly, The Possessor of Forgiveness for humanity in spite of their injustice. And, truly, thy Lord is Severe in repayment","13:7":"And those who were ungrateful say: Why was a sign not caused to descend to him from his Lord? Thou art only one who warns, and one who guides every folk","13:8":"God knows what every female carries and how much her womb absorbs and what they add. And everything with Him is in proportion","13:9":"He is One Who Knows the unseen and the visible, The Great, The One Who is Raised High","13:10":"It is equal to Him whether you kept secret his saying or you published it. Or whoever he be, one who conceals himself by nighttime or one who goes about carelessly in the daytime","13:11":"For him there are Ones Who Postpone from before him and from behind him to keep him safe by the command of God. Truly, God alters not a folk until they alter what is within themselves. And when God wanted evil for a folk, then, there is no turning it back. And there is not for them other than He anyone who is a safeguarder","13:12":"It is He Who causes you to see the lightning in fear and in hope. And it is He Who causes the clouds to grow heavy","13:13":"and thunder glorifies His praise and the angels, because of their awe of Him. And He sends thunderbolts and He lights on whom He wills. And they dispute about God, and He is a Severe Force","13:14":"For Him is the call of The Truth. And those whom they call to other than Him, they respond not to them at all, but like one who stretches out the palms of his hands for water so that it should reach his mouth, but it is not that which reaches it. And supplication of the ones who are ungrateful is only wandering astray","13:15":"And to God prostrates whatever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly as does their shade at the first part of the day and the eventide.‡","13:16":"Say: Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth? Say: God! Say: Took you to yourselves other than Him protectors? They control not themselves, neither profiting nor hurting. Say: Are the unwilling to see on the same level as the seeing? Are the shadows on the same level as the light? Made they ascribed associates with God who created as His creation so that creation resembled one another to them? Say: God is One Who is Creator of everything. And He is The One, The Omniscient","13:17":"He caused water to descend from heaven and it flowed into valleys according to their measure. Then, the flood bears away the froth. And from what they kindle in a fire, looking for glitter or sustenance, there is a froth the like of it. Thus, God compares The Truth and falsehood. Then, as for the froth, it goes as swelling scum while what profits humanity abides on the earth. Thus, God propounds parables","13:18":"For those who responded to their Lord there is the fairer. And for those who respond not to Him, if they had all that is in and on the earth and its like with it, they would offer it as ransom. Those, for them will be a dire reckoning and their place of shelter will be hell. Miserable will be the cradling","13:19":"Then, is he who knows what was caused to descend to thee from thy Lord to be The Truth like he who is unwilling to see? It is only those imbued with intuition who recollect","13:20":"Those who live up to their compact with God and break not their solemn promise","13:21":"and those who reach out to what God commanded be joined and dread their Lord and they fear the dire reckoning","13:22":"and those who endured patiently, looking for the Countenance of their Lord and who performed the formal prayer and spent out of what We have provided them in secret and in public, and they drive off the evil deed with benevolence—those, for them is the Ultimate Abode","13:23":"Gardens of Eden which they will enter along with whoever was in accord with morality from among their fathers and their spouses and their offspring. And angels will enter to them from every door saying","13:24":"Peace be to you for what you endured patiently. How excellent is the Ultimate Abode","13:25":"But those who break the compact of God after its solemn promise and sever what God commanded to be joined and make corruption in and on the earth, those, for them is the curse and for them is the Dire Abode","13:26":"God extends the provision for whom He wills and measures it. They were glad in this present life. And there is nothing in this present life like the world to come but a brief enjoyment","13:27":"And those who were ungrateful say: Why was a sign not caused to descend to him from his Lord? Say: Truly, God causes to go astray whom He wills and guides to Himself whomever was penitent","13:28":"those who believed and their hearts are at rest in the remembrance of God, no doubt in the remembrance of God hearts are at rest","13:29":"Those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, there is joy for them and a goodness of destination","13:30":"Thus, We sent thee to a community. Surely, passed away other communities before it so that thou wouldst recount to them what We revealed to thee and they are ungrateful to The Merciful. Say: He is my Lord. There is no god but He. In Him I put my trust and to Him I am turning in repentance","13:31":"If there were a Recitation that would have set mountains in motion with it, or the earth would be cut off with it or the dead would be spoken to with it, nay! The command is altogether with God. Do those who believed not have knowledge that if God wills He would have guided humanity altogether. Will cease not to light on those who were ungrateful disaster because of what they crafted? Or will it alight close to their abode until the promise of God approaches? Truly, God breaks not His solemn declaration","13:32":"And, certainly, Messengers were ridiculed before thee, but I granted indulgence to those who were ungrateful. Again, I took them. How had been My repayment","13:33":"Is He, then, One Who Sustains Every Soul for what it earned? And yet they ascribe associates with God! Say: Name them! Or will you tell Him of what He knows not in the earth? Or name you only them in the manifest sayings? Nay!

And whomever God causes to go astray, for him there is no one who guides","13:34":"For them is a punishment in this present life and, certainly, punishment in the world to come will be one that presses hard. And for them is no one who is a defender against God","13:35":"A parable of the Garden which was promised to the ones who are Godfearing; beneath it rivers run.

That is the Ultimate End of those who were Godfearing; and the Ultimate End of the ones who are ungrateful is the fire","13:36":"And those to whom We gave the Book are glad at what was caused to descend to thee. And there are among the confederates some who reject some of it. Say: I was commanded to worship only God and not to ascribe partners with Him. I call to Him and to Him is my destination","13:37":"And, thus, We caused to descend an Arabic determination. If thou hadst followed their desires after what drew near thee of the knowledge, thou wouldst not have against God either a protector or one who is a defender","13:38":"And, certainly, We sent Messengers before thee and We assigned for them spouses and offspring.

None knows them but God. Their Messengers drew near them with the clear portents, but they shoved their hands into their mouths in denial. Then, they said: Truly, we disbelieved in what you were sent and we are in uncertainty about that to which you call us. We are in grave doubt","14:10":"Their Messengers said: Is there any uncertainty about God, One Who is Originator of the heavens and the earth?

And He caused the nighttime to be subservient to you and the daytime","14:34":"And He gave you all that you asked of Him. And if you were to number the divine blessing of God, you would not count them, truly, the human being is wrongdoing and an ingrate","14:35":"And when Abraham said: My Lord! Make this land that which is safe and cause me and my children to turn away from worshipping idols","14:36":"My Lord!

Their glance goes not back to them. And their minds are void","14:44":"And warn humanity of a Day the punishment will approach them. So those who did wrong will say: Our Lord! Postpone for us a near term so that we answer Thy call and follow the Messengers. Yet swore you not an oath before that there would be no ceasing for you","14:45":"And you inhabited the dwellings of those who did wrong to themselves. And it became clear to you how We accomplished against them and We propounded for you parables","14:46":"And, surely, they planned their plan and their plan was with God, even if their plan had been to displace mountains","14:47":"So assume not that God will be one who breaks His promise to His Messengers. Truly, God is Almighty, Possessor of Requital","14:48":"On a Day when the earth will be substituted for other than this earth and the heavens, they will depart to God, The One, The Omniscient God","14:49":"and thou wilt consider the ones who sin that Day, ones who are chained in bonds","14:50":"their tunics are made of pitch and the fire will overcome their faces","14:51":"so that God would give recompense to every soul for what it earned.

Surely, passed away before them a custom of the ancient ones","15:14":"And even if We opened for them a door from heaven and they continued going up to it","15:15":"they would say: Truly, our sight was dazzled. Nay! We were a bewitched folk","15:16":"And, certainly, We made constellations in the heavens and We made them appear pleasing to the ones who look","15:17":"And We kept them safe from every accursed satan","15:18":"but he who had the ability to hear by eavesdropping. Then, a clear flame pursued him","15:19":"And We stretched out the earth and We cast on it firm mountains and We caused to develop on it that which was well-balanced of everything","15:20":"And We made on it for you a livelihood and for whomever you are not ones who provide","15:21":"And there is not a thing, but its treasures are with Us and We send it down not but in a known measure","15:22":"And We sent fertilizing winds.

And He is The Almighty, The Wise","16:61":"And if God were to take humanity to task for their injustice, He would not leave on it a moving creature. Rather, He postpones them for a term, that is determined. And when their term drew near, neither will they delay it an hour, nor press it forward","16:62":"And they assign to God what they dislike. Their tongues allege the lie that the fairer things will be theirs. Without a doubt, for them is the fire, and they will be ones made to hasten to it","16:63":"By God! We, certainly, sent Messengers to communities before thee. Satan made their actions appear pleasing to them.

Truly, God knows what you accomplish","16:92":"And be not like she who would break what she spun after firming its fibers by taking to yourselves your oaths in mutual deceit among yourselves so that one community be one that is swelling more than another community. God tries you but by this. And He will make manifest to you on the Day of Resurrection about what you had been at variance in it","16:93":"If God willed, He would have made you one community, but He causes to go astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And, certainly, you will be asked about what you had been doing","16:94":"Take not your oaths to yourselves in mutual deceit among yourselves, that your footing should not backslide after standing firm and you experience the evil of having barred from the way of God.

And he says: Would that I not ascribe partners with my Lord anyone","18:43":"And there is no faction to help him other than God. And he had been one who is helpless","18:44":"All protection there belongs to God, The Truth. He is Best in rewarding for good deeds and Best in consequence","18:45":"And propound for them the parable of this present life: It is like water that We caused to descend from heaven. Then, plants of the earth mingled with it and it becomes straw in the morning that winnows in the winds. And God had been over everything One Who is Omnipotent","18:46":"Wealth and children are the adornment of this present life. But that which endures are ones in accord with morality. These are better with thy Lord in reward for good deeds and better for hopefulness","18:47":"And on a Day We will set in motion the mountains and thou wilt see the earth as that which will depart. And We will assemble them and not leave out anyone of them","18:48":"And they were presented before thy Lord ranged in rows. Certainly, you drew near Us as We created you the first time. Nay! You claimed that We never assign for you something that is promised","18:49":"And the Book was set in place and thou wilt see the ones who sin being ones who are apprehensive as to what is in it. And they will say: Woe to us! What is this Book? It neither leaves out anything small or great, but counted everything. They will find present what their hands had done. And thy Lord does not wrong anyone","18:50":"And mention when We said to the angels: Prostrate yourselves to Adam! So they prostrated themselves but Iblis. He had been among the jinn and he disobeyed the command of His Lord. Will you, then, take him to yourselves and his offspring to be protectors other than Me while they are an enemy to you? Miserable was it to give in place ones who are unjust","18:51":"I called them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth nor to their own creation of themselves nor took I to myself the ones who are led astray as assistants","18:52":"And on a Day when He will say: Cry out to My associates, those who you claimed. Then, they will call out to them, but they will not respond to them and We will make a gulf of doom between them","18:53":"And the unjust will see the ones who sin in the fire. They thought that they are ones who are about to fall in it and they will not find a place to turn from it","18:54":"And, certainly, We diversified in this, the Quran, every kind of example for humanity. And the human being had been more than anything argumentative","18:55":"Nothing prevented humanity from believing when the guidance drew near to them or from asking forgiveness of their Lord, but that approaches them a custom of the ancient ones or approaches them the punishment face to face","18:56":"We send not the ones who are sent, but as ones who give good tidings and as ones who warn. And those who were ungrateful dispute with falsehood in order to refute The Truth by it. And they took My signs to themselves—and what they were warned of—in mockery","18:57":"And who does greater wrong than he who was reminded of the signs of his Lord, then, turned aside from them and forgot what his hands put forward? Truly, We laid sheathes on their hearts so that they should not understand it and heaviness in their ears. And if thou hast called them to the guidance, yet they will not be truly guided ever","18:58":"And thy Lord is Forgiving, Possessor of Mercy. If He were to take them to task for what they earned, He will quicken the punishment for them. But for them is what they are promised, from which they will never find a way to elude it","18:59":"And these towns, We caused them to perish when they did wrong and We assigned for their destruction what is promised","18:60":"Mention when Moses said to his spiritual warrior: I will not quit until I reach the place of meeting of the two seas even if I will go on for many years","18:61":"But when they reached the place of the meeting between them, then, they both forgot their great fish and it took to itself a way through the sea, burrowing","18:62":"Then, when they crossed, he said to his spiritual warrior: Give us our breakfast. Certainly, we met fatigue from our journey","18:63":"He said: Hadst thou considered? When we took shelter at the rock, truly, I forgot the great fish. And none but Satan caused me to forget to remember it. And it took to itself to a way into the sea in a wondrous way","18:64":"He said: That is what we had been looking for! So they went back following their footsteps","18:65":"Then, they found a servant among Our servants to whom We gave mercy from Us and We taught him knowledge which proceeds from Our Presence","18:66":"Moses said to him: May I follow thee so that thou wilt teach me something of what thou wert taught of right judgment","18:67":"He said: Truly, thou wilt never be able to have patience with me","18:68":"And how wilt thou endure a thing patiently when thou hast not comprehended any awareness of it","18:69":"Moses said: Thou wilt find me, if God willed, one who remains steadfast and I will not rebel against thy command","18:70":"He said: Then, if thou hadst followed me, ask me not about anything until I cause to be evoked in thee a remembrance of it","18:71":"So they both set out until when they embarked in a vessel. He made a hole in it. Moses said: Hadst thou made a hole in it in order to drown the people? Certainly, thou hadst brought about a dreadful thing","18:72":"He said: Said I not that thou wilt never be able to have patience with me","18:73":"Moses said: Take me not to task for what I forgot and constrain me not with hardship for my affair","18:74":"Then, they both set out until when they met a boy; then, he killed him. Moses said: Hadst thou killed a pure soul without his having slain a soul? Certainly, thou hadst brought about a horrible thing","18:75":"He said: Said I not that thou wilt never be able to have patience with me","18:76":"Moses said: If I asked thee about anything after this, then, keep not company with me, surely, thou hadst reached enough of excusing from my presence","18:77":"Then, they both set out until when they approached a people of a town. They asked its people for food. But they refused to receive them as guests. Then, they found in it a wall that wants to tumble down, so he repaired it. Moses said: If thou hadst willed, certainly, thou wouldst have taken compensation to thyself for it","18:78":"He said: This is the parting between me and between thee! I will tell thee the interpretation of what thou wert not able to have patience for it","18:79":"As for the vessel, it had been of some needy people who toil in the sea, so I wanted to mar it as there had been a king behind them taking every vessel forcefully","18:80":"And as for the boy, both his parents had been ones who believe, and we dreaded that he should constrain them with defiance and ingratitude","18:81":"so we wanted their Lord to cause for them in exchange one better than he in purity and nearer in sympathy","18:82":"As for the wall, it had been that of two orphan boys in the city and beneath it had been a treasure for them. The father of both of them had been one in accord with morality so thy Lord wanted they be fully grown, having come of age, and pull out their treasure as a mercy from thy Lord. And I accomplished that not of my own command. This is the interpretation of what thou wert not able to have patience for it","18:83":"And they will ask thee about Dhu-l Qarnayn. Say: I will recount to you a remembrance of him","18:84":"Truly, We established him firmly on the earth and gave him a route to everything","18:85":"So he pursued a route","18:86":"until when he reached the setting of the sun. He found it beginning to set in a spring of muddy water. And he found near it a folk. We said: O Dhu-l Qarnayn! Either thou wilt punish them or thou wilt take them to thyself with goodness","18:87":"He said: As for him who did wrong, we will punish him. Again, he will be returned to his Lord Who will punish him with a horrible punishment","18:88":"But as for him who believed and did as one in accord with morality, he will have the fairer recompense. And we will say to him of our command with ease","18:89":"Again, he pursued a route","18:90":"until when he reached the rising place of the sun. He found it coming up on a folk for whom We make not any obstruction against it","18:91":"Thus, We, surely, enclosed whatever was near him through awareness","18:92":"Again, he pursued a route","18:93":"until when he reached between two embankments. He found behind them a folk who would almost not understand any saying","18:94":"They said: O Dhu-l Qarnayn! Truly, Gog and Magog are ones who make corruption in and on the earth. Will we assign to thee payment if thou hast made an embankment between us and between them","18:95":"He said: What my Lord established firmly for me is better, so assist me with strength. I will make a fortification between you and between them","18:96":"Give me ingots of iron, until when he made level between the two cliffs. He said: Blow, until when he made it a fire. He said: Give me molten brass to pour out over it","18:97":"So they were not able to scale it nor were they able to dig through it","18:98":"He said: This is a mercy from my Lord. So when the promise of my Lord drew near, He will made it powder. And the promise of my Lord had been true","18:99":"And that Day We will leave some of them to surge like waves on some others. And the trumpet will be blown, then, We will gather them altogether","18:100":"We will present the depths of hell on that Day in plain view to ones who are ungrateful","18:101":"to those whose eyes had been screened from My Remembrance and who had not been able to hear","18:102":"Assumed ones who were ungrateful that they take My servants to themselves as protectors instead of Me? Truly, We made hell ready with hospitality for ones who are ungrateful","18:103":"Say: Shall We tell you who will be ones who are losers by their actions","18:104":"It is those whose endeavoring went astray in this present life while they assume that they are doing good by their handiwork","18:105":"Those were those who were ungrateful for the signs of their Lord and the meeting with Him so their actions were fruitless. And so We will not perform for them on the Day of Resurrection, any weighing","18:106":"That will be their recompense—hell—because they were ungrateful and took to themselves My signs and My Messengers in mockery","18:107":"Truly, those who believed and did as ones in accord with morality, their hospitality had been in the Gardens of Paradise","18:108":"ones who will dwell in them forever. They will have no desire for relocation from there","18:109":"Say: If the sea had been ink for the Words of my Lord, the sea would come to an end before the Words of my Lord came to an end even if We brought about replenishment the like of it","18:110":"Say: I am only a mortal like you. It is revealed to me that your God is One, so whoever had been hoping for the meeting with his Lord, let him do with his actions as one in accord with morality and ascribe no partners—in the worship of his Lord, ever","19:1":"K[f H[ Y[ <A @[d]","19:2":"A remembrance of the mercy of thy Lord to His servant Zechariah","19:3":"when he cried out to his Lord, secretively crying out","19:4":"He said: My Lord! Truly, I—my bones became feeble and my head became studded with grayness of hair and I be not disappointed in my supplication to Thee, O my Lord","19:5":"And, truly, I feared for my defenders after me. And my woman had been a barren woman. So bestow on me from that which proceeds from Thy Presence a protector","19:6":"He will inherit from me and inherit from the family of Jacob. And make him, my Lord, pleasing","19:7":"O Zechariah! Truly, We give thee the good tidings of a boy. His name will be Yahya and We assigned it not as a namesake for anyone before","19:8":"He said: My Lord! How will I have a boy while my woman had been a barren woman and, surely, I reached an advanced old age","19:9":"He said: It is about to be! Thy Lord said: It is insignificant for Me and, surely, I created thee before when thou wast nothing","19:10":"Zechariah said: My Lord! Assign for me a sign. He said: Thy sign is that thou wilt not speak to humanity for three nights, although being without fault","19:11":"So he went forth to his folk from the sanctuary. Then, he revealed to them: Glorify in the early morning dawn and evening","19:12":"O Yahya! Take the Book with strength. And We gave him critical judgment while a lad","19:13":"and Our continuous mercy from that which proceeds from Our Presence and purity and he had been devout","19:14":"and pious to ones who are his parents and be not haughty nor rebellious","19:15":"And peace be on him the day on which he was given birth and the day he dies and the day he is raised up, living","19:16":"And remember Mary in the Book when she went apart from her people to an eastern place","19:17":"Then, she took to herself a partition away from them, so We sent Our Spirit to her and he presented himself before her as a mortal without fault","19:18":"She said: Truly, I take refuge in The Merciful from thee; come not near me if thou hadst been devout","19:19":"He said: I am only a messenger from thy Lord that I bestow on thee (f) a pure boy","19:20":"She said: How will I have a boy when no mortal touches me, nor am I an unchaste woman","19:21":"He said: Thus, it will be. Thy Lord said: It is for Me insignificant. And: We will assign him as a sign for humanity and as a mercy from Us. And it had been that which is a decreed command","19:22":"So she conceived him and she went apart with him to a farther place","19:23":"And the birth pangs surprised her at the trunk of a date palm tree. She said: O would that I had died before this and I had been one who is forgotten, a forgotten thing","19:24":"So he cried out to her from beneath her: Feel not remorse! Surely, thy Lord made under thee (f) a brook","19:25":"And shake towards thee (f) the trunk of the date palm tree. It will cause ripe, fresh dates to fall on thee","19:26":"So eat and drink and thy eyes be refreshed. If thou hast seen any mortal, say: I vowed formal fasting to The Merciful so I will never speak to any human being this day","19:27":"Then, she approached her folk with him, carrying him. They said: O Mary! Surely, thou hadst drawn near a monstrous thing","19:28":"O sister of Aaron! Thy father had not been a reprehensible man nor was thy mother an unchaste woman","19:29":"Then, she pointed to him. They said: How speak we to one who had been in the cradle, a lad","19:30":"Jesus said: Truly, I am a servant of God. He gave me the Book and He made me a Prophet","19:31":"And He made me one who is blessed wherever I had been and He bequeathed to me the formal prayer and the purifying alms as long as I continue living","19:32":"and He makes me pious toward one who is my mother and He makes me not haughty nor disappointed","19:33":"And peace be on me the day I was given birth and the day I die and the day I am raised up, living","19:34":"That is Jesus son of Mary, a saying of The Truth. They contest what is in it","19:35":"It had not been for God that He takes to Himself a son. Glory be to Him! When He decreed a command, He not but says to it: Be! Then, it is","19:36":"And, truly, God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path","19:37":"There was variance among the confederates, so woe to those who were ungrateful from the scene of a tremendous Day","19:38":"Hear well and perceive well. On that Day they will approach Us, but today the ones who are unjust are in a clear wandering astray","19:39":"And warn thou them of the Day of Regret when the command would be decided. Yet they are heedless and they believe not","19:40":"Truly, We will inherit the earth and whatever is in and on it and to Us they will be returned","19:41":"And remember Abraham in the Book. Truly, he had been a just person, a Prophet","19:42":"That is when he said to his father: O my father! Why wilt thou worship what hears not, and perceives not, and avails thee not anything","19:43":"O my father! Truly, I, there drew near me of the knowledge of what approaches thee not. So follow me and I will guide thee to a path without fault","19:44":"O my father! Worship not Satan. Truly, Satan had been rebellious towards The Merciful","19:45":"O my father! Truly, I fear that a punishment should afflict thee from The Merciful so that thou become a protector of Satan","19:46":"He said: Art thou one who shrinks from my gods, O Abraham? If thou wilt not refrain thyself, certainly, I will stone thee, so abandon me for some while","19:47":"He said: Peace be to thee. I will ask for forgiveness from my Lord for thee. Truly, He had been One Who is Gracious to me","19:48":"And I will withdraw from you and what you call to other than God and I will call to my Lord. Perhaps I will not be disappointed in my supplication to my Lord","19:49":"So he withdrew from them and what they worship other than God. And We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob. And each of them We made a Prophet","19:50":"And We bestowed on them from Our mercy and We assigned them the tongue of lofty sincerity","19:51":"And remember Moses in the Book. Truly, he had been one who was devoted and he had been a Messenger, a Prophet","19:52":"And We proclaimed to him from the right edge of the mount and We brought him near privately","19:53":"And We bestowed on him out of Our mercy his brother Aaron, a Prophet","19:54":"And remember Ishmael in the Book. Truly, he had been one who is sincere in his promise, and he had been a Messenger, a Prophet","19:55":"He had been commanding his people to formal prayer and the purifying alms and he had been with His Lord one who is well-pleasing","19:56":"And remember Enoch in the Book. Truly, he had been a just person, a Prophet","19:57":"And We exalted him to a lofty place","19:58":"Those are those to whom God was gracious from among the Prophets of the offspring of Adam and whomever We carried with Noah and of the offspring of Abraham and Israel, Jacob, from among whomever We guided and elected. When are recounted to them the signs of the Merciful they fell down, crying, ones who prostrate themselves.‡","19:59":"Then, after them succeeded a succession who wasted the formal prayer and followed their lusts. So they will meet error","19:60":"but the ones who repented and believed and did as ones in accord with morality. For those will enter the Garden and they will not be wronged at all","19:61":"Gardens of Eden which The Merciful promised His servants in the unseen. Truly, He, His promise had been that which is kept","19:62":"They will not hear in them idle talk, nothing but: Peace. And they will have their provision in them in the early morning dawn and evening","19:63":"This is the Garden which We will give as inheritance to whomever of Our servants who had been devout","19:64":"And we come forth not but by the command of thy Lord. To Him belongs whatever is in advance of us and whatever is behind us and whatever is in between that. And thy Lord had not been forgetful","19:65":"the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and what is between them! So worship Him and maintain thou patience in His worship. Hast thou known any namesake for Him","19:66":"And the human being says: When I am dead, will I be brought out living","19:67":"Will the human being not remember that We created him before when he be of nothing","19:68":"So by thy Lord, certainly, We will assemble them and the satans. Again, We will parade them around hell, ones who crawl on their knees","19:69":"Again, We will tear out every partisan, whoever of them was more severe in stubborn rebellion against The Merciful","19:70":"After that We are greater in knowledge of those, they who are most deserving of roasting in it","19:71":"There is none of you, but ones who go down to it. This had been a thing decreed, that decreed by thy Lord","19:72":"Again, We will deliver those who were Godfearing and We will forsake the ones who are unjust, in it, ones who crawl on their knees","19:73":"And when are recounted to them Our signs, clear portents, those who were ungrateful would say to those who believed: Which of the two groups of people is best in station and fairer in alliance","19:74":"How many before them We caused to perish whose generation was fairer in furnishing and outward show","19:75":"Say: Whoever had been in fallacy, The Merciful will prolong his prolonging for him. Until when they would see what they are promised, either the punishment or the Hour, then, they will know whose place is worse and whose army is weak","19:76":"And God increases in guidance those who were truly guided and endure in accord with morality. They are better with thy Lord in reward for good deeds and better for turning back","19:77":"Hadst thou seen him who was ungrateful for Our signs, who said: Will I be given wealth and children","19:78":"Perused he the unseen or took he to himself a compact from The Merciful","19:79":"No indeed! We will write down what he says. We will cause the punishment to increase for him, prolonging it","19:80":"And We will inherit from him all that he says and he will approach Us individually","19:81":"And they took to themselves gods other than God that there be a triumph for them","19:82":"No indeed! They will disbelieve in what they worship and they will be taking a stand against them","19:83":"Hast thou not considered that We sent the satans against the ones who were ungrateful to confound them with confusion","19:84":"So hasten thou not against them. We only number for them a sum","19:85":"On the Day We will assemble the ones who are Godfearing to The Merciful like an entourage","19:86":"And We will drive the ones who sin to hell, herding them","19:87":"None of them will possess the power of intercession but such a one who took to himself a compact with The Merciful","19:88":"And they said: The Merciful took to Himself a son","19:89":"Certainly, you brought about a disastrous thing","19:90":"whereby the heavens are almost split asunder and the earth is split and the mountains fall crashing down","19:91":"that they attributed a son to The Merciful","19:92":"It is not fit and proper for The Merciful that He should take a son to Himself","19:93":"There is none at all in the heavens and the earth but he be one who arrives to The Merciful as a servant","19:94":"Certainly, He counted for them and numbered up a sum","19:95":"And every one of them will be ones who arrive to Him individually on the Day of Resurrection","19:96":"Truly, those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, The Merciful will assign ardor for them","19:97":"So, truly, We made this easy on thy tongue. Certainly, thou wilt give good tidings with it to the ones who are Godfearing and thou wilt warn a most stubborn folk with it","19:98":"How many a generation caused We to perish before them? Art thou conscious of anyone of them or hear you so much as a whisper from them","20:1":"H","20:2":"We caused not the Quran to descend to thee that thee be in despair","20:3":"but as an admonition to him who dreads","20:4":"a sending down successively from Him Who created the earth and the lofty heavens","20:5":"The Merciful turned His attention to the Throne","20:6":"To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and whatever is between them and whatever is beneath the soil","20:7":"And if thou art to publish a saying, yet, truly, He knows the secret and what is more secret","20:8":"God, there is no god but He. To Him belongs the Fairer Names","20:9":"Has the conversation of Moses approached thee","20:10":"When he saw a fire, he said to his people: Abide! Truly, I observed a fire so that perhaps I will bring you some firebrand from it or I find guidance at the fire","20:11":"When he approached it, it was proclaimed: O Moses","20:12":"Truly, I—I am thy Lord! So take off thy shoes; truly, thou art one who is in the sanctified valley of Tuwa","20:13":"And I chose thee so listen to what is revealed","20:14":"Truly, I—I am God. There is no god but Me. So worship Me and perform the formal prayer of My Remembrance","20:15":"Truly, the Hour is that which arrives. I am about to conceal it so that every soul is given recompense for what it endeavors","20:16":"So let none bar thee from it—whoever believes not in it and followed his own desires—so that thee not survive","20:17":"And what is that in thy right hand O Moses","20:18":"Moses said: This is my staff. I lean on it, and beat down leaves from a tree with it for my herd of sheep and for me in it are other uses","20:19":"He said: Cast it, O Moses","20:20":"So he cast it. That is when it was a viper sliding","20:21":"He said: Take it and fear not. We will cause it to return to its first state","20:22":"And clasp thy hand to thy armpit. It will go forth shimmering white without any evil as another sign","20:23":"that We cause thee to see of Our greater signs","20:24":"Go thou to Pharaoh! Truly, he was defiant","20:25":"Moses said: My Lord","20:26":"Expand my breast for me and make Thou my affair easy for me","20:27":"and untie the knot from my tongue","20:28":"so they understand my saying","20:29":"and assign to me a minister from my people—","20:30":"—Aaron, my brother","20:31":"Strengthen my vigor with him","20:32":"and ascribe him as a partner in my affair","20:33":"that we glorify Thee much","20:34":"and we remember Thee frequently","20:35":"Truly, Thou, Thou alone hadst been seeing of us","20:36":"He said: Surely, thou wert given thy petition, O Moses","20:37":"Certainly, We showed grace on thee another time","20:38":"when We revealed to thy mother what is revealed","20:39":"Cast him adrift in the ark. Then, cast it adrift into the water of the sea. Then, the water of the sea will cast him up on the bank and he will be taken by an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his. And I cast on thee fondness from Me that thou be trained under My Eye","20:40":"Mention when thy sister walks saying: Shall I point you to one who will take control of him? So We returned thee to thy mother that her eyes settle down and she not feel remorse. And thou hast killed a soul, but We delivered thee from lament and We tried thee with an ordeal. Then, thou hadst lingered in expectation years among the people of Midian. Again, thou hadst drawn near according to a measure, O Moses","20:41":"And I chose thee for service for Myself","20:42":"Go thou and thy brother with My signs and you both not be inattentive in My Remembrance","20:43":"So go both of you to Pharaoh. Truly, he had become defiant","20:44":"And both say to him a saying gently, so that perhaps he will recollect or dread","20:45":"They both said: Our Lord! Truly, we fear that he should exceed against us or that he be defiant","20:46":"He said: Fear not. Truly, I am with both of you. I hear and I see","20:47":"So approach you both to him and say: Truly, we are Messengers of thy Lord. So send the Children of Israel with us and punish them not. Surely, we drew near thee with a sign from thy Lord. And peace be to him who followed the guidance","20:48":"Surely, it was revealed to us that the punishment is on him who denied and turned away","20:49":"He said: Then, who is the Lord of you two, O Moses","20:50":"He said: Our Lord is He Who gave everything its creation; again, He guided it","20:51":"Pharaoh said: Then, what of the first generations","20:52":"Moses said: The knowledge of them is with my Lord in a Book. My Lord neither goes astray nor forgets","20:53":"He it is Who assigned for you the earth as a cradle and threaded ways for you in it and caused water to descend from heaven. And We brought out from it diverse pairs of plants","20:54":"Eat and give attention to your flocks. Truly, in this are signs for the people imbued with sense","20:55":"We created you from it and into it We will cause you to return and from it We will bring you out another time","20:56":"And, certainly, We caused Pharaoh to see Our signs—all of them—but he denied and refused","20:57":"He said: Hast thou drawn near us to drive us out of our region with thy sorcery, O Moses","20:58":"Then, truly, we will bring for thee sorcery like it. So make something that is promised between us and thee—neither we nor thou will break it—at a mutually agreeable place","20:59":"Moses said: That promised will be for the Day of Adornment and let humanity be assembled in the forenoon","20:60":"So Pharaoh turned away. Then, he gathered his cunning. After that he approached","20:61":"Moses said to them: Woe to you! Devise you not a lie against God so that He put an end to you with a punishment. And, surely, he who devised will be frustrated","20:62":"So they contended between each other about their affair and they kept secret, conspiring secretly","20:63":"They said: Truly, these two are the ones who are sorcerers who want to drive you out from your region with their sorcery and take away your most ideal behavior","20:64":"So summon up your cunning. Again, approach ranged in rows. And, truly, he who prospered this day is whoever gained the upper hand","20:65":"They said: O Moses! Either thou wilt cast or let us be the first to cast","20:66":"He said: Nay! You cast. That is when their ropes and their staffs seem to him to be, by their sorcery, as though they are sliding","20:67":"So Moses sensed awe in himself","20:68":"We said: Fear not! Truly, thou, thou art lofty","20:69":"And cast what is in thy right hand. It will swallow what they crafted. What they crafted is not but the cunning of one who is a sorcerer. And the one who is a sorcerer will not prosper in whatever he approached","20:70":"Then, the ones who are sorcerers were cast down, ones who prostrate themselves. They said: We believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses","20:71":"Pharaoh said: Believed you in Him before I give you permission? Truly, he is your teacher who taught you the sorcery. So, certainly, I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and, certainly, I will cause you to be crucified on the trunks of date palm trees, and, certainly, you will know which of us is more severe in punishment and one who endures","20:72":"They said: We will never hold thee in greater favor over the clear portents that drew near us nor over Who originated us. So decide whatever thou wilt as one who decides. Thou wilt decide not but about this present life","20:73":"For us, truly, we believed in our Lord that He forgive us our transgressions and what thou hadst compelled us to do because of the sorcery. And God is Best of one who endures","20:74":"Truly, whoever approaches his Lord as one who sins, then, truly, for him is hell. Neither will he die in it nor will he live","20:75":"And whoever approaches Him as one who believes, who, surely, did as the one in accord with morality, then, for those, they are of lofty degrees","20:76":"Gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever. And that is the recompense of whoever purified himself","20:77":"And, certainly, We revealed to Moses that set thou forth with My servants. Then, strike for them a dry road in the sea, neither fearing to be overtaken, nor dreading that","20:78":"Then, Pharaoh and his army pursued them. Then, overcame them the water of the sea by what overcame","20:79":"And Pharaoh caused his folk to go astray and he guided them not","20:80":"O Children of Israel! Surely, We rescued you from your enemy and We appointed someone with you on the right edge of the mount and We sent down to you the manna and the quails","20:81":"Eat from what is good that We provided you, and be not defiant in it so that My anger not alight on you. And he on whom My anger alights surely, will be hurled to ruin","20:82":"And, truly, I am a Forgiver of whoever repented and believed and did as one in accord with morality. Again, he was truly guided","20:83":"And what caused thee to hasten from thy folk, O Moses","20:84":"Moses said: They are those who are close on my footsteps and I hastened to Thee, my Lord that I please thee","20:85":"He said: Then, truly, We tried thy folk after thee and the Samaritan caused them to go astray","20:86":"Then, Moses returned to his folk enraged, grieved. He said: O my folk! Promise you not with your Lord a fairer promise? Was the compact too long for you to wait? Or wanted you that the anger of your Lord alight on you, so you broke what you were to have promised me","20:87":"They said: We broke not what was promised to thee from what is within our power, but we were charged with a heavy load of the adornments of the folk. Surely, we hurled them because the Samaritan cast","20:88":"Then, he brought out for them a calf, a lifeless body that had the lowing sound of flocks. Then, they said: This is your god and the God of Moses whom he forgot","20:89":"Then, see they not that it returns not to them a saying and it possesses for them neither hurt nor profit","20:90":"And, certainly, Aaron said to them before: O my folk! You were only tempted by it. And, truly, your Lord is The Merciful. So follow me and obey my command","20:91":"They said: We will never quit it as ones who give ourselves up until Moses returns to us","20:92":"He said: O Aaron! What prevented thee when thou hadst seen them going astray","20:93":"that thou hast followed me not? Hast thou, then, rebelled against my command","20:94":"Aaron said: O son of my mother! Take me not by my beard nor by my head. Truly, I dreaded that thou hast said: Thou hadst separated and divided between the Children of Israel and thou hast not regarded my saying","20:95":"Moses said: Then, what is thy business O Samaritan","20:96":"He said: I kept watch over what they keep not watch, so I seized a handful of dust from the foot prints of the Messenger and cast it forth. And thus my soul enticed me","20:97":"Moses said: Then go off! Truly for thee in this life is that thou mayest say: Untouchable; there is for thee something promised that thou shalt never break; and look on thy god that thou hast stayed with and given thyself up to; certainly we will burn it. After that we will certainly scatter it in the water of the sea in a scattering","20:98":"Your God is only God Whom there is no god but He. He encompassed everything in His knowledge","20:99":"Thus We relate to thee some tiding of what preceded. And surely We gave thee from that which proceeds from Our Presence a Remembrance","20:100":"Whoever turned aside from it, then truly he will carry a heavy load on the Day of Resurrection","20:101":"ones who will dwell in it forever; how evil for them on the Day of Resurrection will be the load","20:102":"on the Day the trumpet will be blown. We will assemble the ones who sin, white eyed on that Day","20:103":"They will whisper among themselves: You lingered in expectation but ten days","20:104":"We are greater in knowledge of what they will say when the most ideal of them in tradition says: You lingered in expectation not but a day","20:105":"And they will ask thee about the mountains. Then, say: My Lord will scatter them a scattering","20:106":"Then, He will forsake it as a leveled spacious plain","20:107":"Then, thou wilt see not in it any crookedness nor unevenness","20:108":"On that Day they will follow one who calls. There will be no crookedness in him. And voices will be hushed for The Merciful so thou wilt hear nothing but a murmuring","20:109":"On a Day intercession will not profit anyone but him to whom gave permission The Merciful and with whose saying He was well-pleased","20:110":"He knows what is in advance of them and what is behind them and they will not comprehend Him in knowledge","20:111":"And faces will be humbled before The Living, The Eternal while, surely, will be frustrated whoever was burdened by doing injustice","20:112":"Whoever does as the one in accord with morality and he is one who believes, then, he will neither fear injustice nor unfairness","20:113":"And, thus, We caused it to descend as an Arabic Recitation. And We diversified the threats in it so that perhaps they will be Godfearing or cause the Remembrance to be evoked by them","20:114":"Then, exalted be God, The True King, and hasten not the Recitation before its revelation is decreed to thee. And say: My Lord! Increase me in knowledge","20:115":"And, certainly, We made a compact with Adam before. Then, he forgot and We find no constancy in him","20:116":"And when We said to the angels: Prostrate yourselves to Adam! They prostrated themselves, but Iblis who refused","20:117":"Then, We said: O Adam! Truly, this is an enemy to thee and to thy spouse, so let him not drive you both out from the Garden so that thou wouldst be in despair","20:118":"Truly, it is not for thee that thou hunger in it nor to be naked","20:119":"And, truly, thou wilt not thirst in it nor suffer the heat of the sun","20:120":"Then, Satan whispered evil to him. He said: O Adam! Will I point thee to the Tree of Infinity and a dominion that will not decay","20:121":"Then, they both ate from that so the intimate parts of both showed to both themselves. Both of them took to doing stitching together over both from the leaves of the Garden. And Adam rebelled against his Lord and he erred","20:122":"Again, his Lord elected him. Then, He turned in forgiveness to him and guided him","20:123":"He said: Get you both down from here altogether, some of you an enemy to some others. Then, if guidance approaches you from Me, then, whoever followed My Guidance, neither will he go astray, nor will he be in despair","20:124":"And whoever turned aside from My Remembrance, then, truly, for him is a livelihood of narrowness. And We will assemble him on the Day of Resurrection unseeing","20:125":"He would say: My Lord! Why hadst Thou assembled me with the unseeing when, surely, I had been seeing","20:126":"He would say: It is thus: Our signs approached thee, but thou hadst forgotten them and, thus, this Day thou wilt be forgotten","20:127":"And, thus, We give recompense to him who exceeded all bounds and believes not in signs of his Lord. And, surely, punishment in the world to come is more severe and one that endures","20:128":"Guide He not them? How many generations We caused to perish before them amidst whose dwellings they walk. Truly, in this are signs for the people imbued with sense","20:129":"And if a Word preceded not from thy Lord for a term that was determined, it would be close at hand","20:130":"So have thou patience with what they say and glorify the praises of thy Lord before the coming up of the sun and before sunset and during the nighttime night watch and glorify at the end of the daytime, so that perhaps thou wilt be well-pleased","20:131":"And stretch not out thy eyes for what We gave of enjoyment in this life to spouses among them as the luster of this present life so that We try them by it. And provision of thy Lord is Best and that which endures","20:132":"And command thy people to the formal prayer, and to maintain patience in it. We ask not of thee for any provision. We provide for thee and the Ultimate End will be for the God-conscious","20:133":"And they said: Why brings he not to us a sign from his Lord? Approaches them not clear portents that were in the first scrolls","20:134":"And if We caused them to perish with a punishment before this, certainly, they would have said: Our Lord! Why hadst Thou not sent to us a Messenger so that we follow Thy signs before we are degraded and humiliated","20:135":"Say: Each is one who is waiting so watch. Then, you will know who are the Companions of the Path without fault and who were truly guided","21:1":"The reckoning for humanity was near while they are ones who turn aside in heedlessness","21:2":"Approaches them not a remembrance from their Lord, that which is renewed, but they listened to it while they play","21:3":"being ones whose hearts are ones that are diverted, and they kept secret, conspiring secretly those who did wrong? Is this other than a mortal like you? Then, will you approach sorcery while you perceive","21:4":"He said: My Lord knows The Word of the heavens and the earth. And He is The Hearing, The Knowing","21:5":"Nay! They said: Jumbled nightmares! Nay! He but devised it! Nay! He is but a poet! Let him bring us a sign as the ancient ones were sent","21:6":"No town believed before them of whom We caused to perish. Will they, then, believe","21:7":"And We sent not before thee but men to whom We reveal. So ask the People of the Remembrance if you had not been knowing","21:8":"And We made them not lifeless bodies that eat not food nor had they been ones who will dwell forever","21:9":"Again, We were sincere in the promise. So We rescued them and whom We will. We caused the ones who are excessive to perish","21:10":"Surely, We caused a Book to descend to you in which is your Remembrance. Will you not, then, be reasonable","21:11":"How many a town We damaged that had been one that is unjust and caused to grow after them another folk","21:12":"Then, when they were conscious of Our might, that is when they make haste from it","21:13":"Make not haste, but return to what you were given of ease in it and to your dwellings, so that perhaps you will be asked","21:14":"They said: O woe to us! Truly, we had been ones who are unjust","21:15":"Then, truly, they ceased not calling that out until We made them as stubble, ones silent and stilled","21:16":"And We created not the heavens and the earth and what is between them as ones in play","21:17":"If We wanted We would have taken some diversion. We would take it to Ourselves from that which proceeds from Our Presence if We had been ones who do so","21:18":"Nay! We hurl The Truth against falsehood so it prevails over it. That is when falsehood is that which vanishes away. And woe to you for what you allege","21:19":"And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth. And whoever is near Him, they grow not arrogant to worship Him, nor they be weary","21:20":"They glorify Him nighttime and daytime. They never decrease","21:21":"Or took they gods to themselves from the earth, they, ones who revive the dead","21:22":"If there had been gods in it—other than God— certainly, both would have gone to ruin. Then, glory be to God! Lord of the Throne! High above what they allege","21:23":"He will not be asked as to what He accomplishes, but they will be asked","21:24":"Or took they gods to themselves other than He? Say: Prepare your proof. This is a Remembrance for him who is with me and a Remembrance of him before me. Nay! Most of them know not The Truth, so they are ones who turn aside","21:25":"And We sent not before thee any Messenger, but We reveal to him that there is no god but I, so worship Me","21:26":"And they said: The Merciful took to Himself a son. Glory be to Him! Nay! Honored servants","21:27":"They precede Him not in saying and they act by His command","21:28":"He knows what is in advance of them and what is behind them and they intercede not but for him with whom He was content. And they are dreading Him, ones who are apprehensive","21:29":"And whoever says of them: Truly, I am a god other than He, then, We will give recompense to him with hell. Thus, We give recompense to the ones who are unjust","21:30":"Consider not those who were ungrateful that the heavens and the earth had been interwoven and We unstitched them? And We made every living thing of water. Will they, then, not believe","21:31":"And We made firm mountains on the earth so that it should not vibrate with them. And We made in it ravines as ways, so that perhaps they will be truly guided","21:32":"And We made heaven as a guarded roof. Yet they are ones who turn aside from its signs","21:33":"And it is He Who created the nighttime and the daytime, the sun and the moon, each swimming in orbit","21:34":"And We assigned not to any mortal before thee immortality. If thou wert to die will they be ones who dwell forever","21:35":"Every soul is one that experiences death. And We will try you with the worst and good as a test. And to Us you will be returned","21:36":"And when those who were ungrateful saw thee, they take thee to themselves not but in mockery: Ha! Is this he who mentions your gods? And they, for Remembrance of The Merciful, they are ones who are ungrateful","21:37":"The human being was created of haste. I will cause you to see My signs, so seek not to hasten","21:38":"And they say: When will this promise be if you had been ones who are sincere","21:39":"If those who were ungrateful but know at the time when they will not limit the fire from their faces, nor from their backs and they will not be helped","21:40":"Nay! It will approach them suddenly. Then, it will dumfound them so they will not be able to come back nor will they be given respite","21:41":"And, certainly, Messengers were ridiculed before thee. Then, those who derided them were surrounded by what they had been ridiculing","21:42":"Say: Who will guard you in the nighttime and the daytime from The Merciful? Nay! They, from the Remembrance of their Lord, are ones who turn aside","21:43":"Or secure them their gods from Us? They are not able to help themselves, nor will they be rendered safe from Us","21:44":"Nay! We gave enjoyment to these, their fathers until their lifetime was long for them. Consider they not that We approach the earth? We reduce it of its outlying parts. Or will they be the ones who are the victors","21:45":"Say: I warn you only by the revelation. But hear not the unwilling to hear, the calling to them when they are warned","21:46":"And if a breath afflicted them of punishment of thy Lord, they would, surely, say: O woe to us! Truly, we had been ones who are unjust","21:47":"And We will lay down the balances of equity on the Day of Resurrection. Then, no soul will be wronged at all. And even if it had been the weight of a grain of a mustard seed We will bring it. And We sufficed as Ones Who Reckon","21:48":"And, certainly, We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion between right and wrong and an illumination and a Remembrance for the ones who are Godfearing","21:49":"those who dread their Lord in the unseen while they are ones who are apprehensive of the Hour","21:50":"This is a blessed Remembrance We caused to descend. Are you, then, ones who know not of it","21:51":"Certainly, We gave Abraham his right judgment before. And We had been ones who know of him","21:52":"when he said to his father and his folk: What are these images to which you be ones who give yourselves up to","21:53":"They said: We found our fathers as ones who are worshippers of them","21:54":"He said: Certainly, you and your fathers had been in a clear wandering astray","21:55":"They said: Hadst thou drawn near The Truth or art thou of the ones who play","21:56":"He said: Nay! Your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who originated them. And I am of the ones who bear witness to this","21:57":"And by God, I will contrive against your idols after you turn as ones who draw back","21:58":"So he made them broken pieces—but the greatest of them—so that perhaps they will return to it","21:59":"They said: Who accomplished this with our gods? Truly, he is of the ones who are unjust","21:60":"They said: We heard a spiritual warrior (m) mention them. It is said he is Abraham","21:61":"They said: Then, approach with him before the eyes of personages so that perhaps they will bear witness","21:62":"They said: Hast thou accomplished this with our gods O Abraham","21:63":"He said: Nay! It was accomplished by the greatest of them—this. So ask them if they had been able to speak for themselves","21:64":"Then, they returned to one another. Then, they said: Truly, you, you are the ones who are unjust","21:65":"Again, they were put into confusion: Certainly, thou hadst known that these speak not for themselves","21:66":"He said: Worship you, then, other than God what neither profits you nor hurts you at all","21:67":"Fie on you on what you worship other than God. Will you not, then, be reasonable","21:68":"They said: Burn him and help your gods if you had been ones who do so","21:69":"We said: O fire! Be coolness and peace for Abraham","21:70":"And they wanted to use cunning against him, but We made them the ones who are losers","21:71":"And We delivered him and Lot to the region which We blessed for the worlds","21:72":"And We bestowed Isaac on him and Jacob as an unexpected gift. And We made both of them ones in accord with morality","21:73":"And We made them leaders, guiding by Our command. And We revealed to them the accomplishing of good deeds and the performing of the formal prayer and the giving of the purifying alms. And they had been ones who worship Us","21:74":"And to Lot We gave him critical judgment and knowledge and We delivered him from the town which had been doing deeds of corruption. Truly, they had been a reprehensible folk, ones who disobey","21:75":"And We caused him to enter into Our Mercy. Truly, he was among the ones in accord with morality","21:76":"And mention Noah, when he cried out before and We responded to him. And We delivered him and his people from the tremendous distress","21:77":"And We helped him against the folk who denied Our signs. Truly, they had been a reprehensible folk. So We drowned them one and all","21:78":"And mention David and Solomon, when they give judgment about cultivation when a herd of the sheep of his folk strayed. And to their critical judgment We had been ones who bear witness","21:79":"So We caused Solomon to understand it. And We gave each of them critical judgment and knowledge. And We caused to become subservient to David, the mountains and the birds to glorify God. And We had been ones who do such things","21:80":"We taught him the art of making garments of chain mail for you to fortify you from your violence. Will you, then, be ones who are thankful","21:81":"And to Solomon, the wind tempest runs by His command toward the earth which We blessed. We had been ones who know everything","21:82":"Among the satans are some who dive for him and do actions other than that. And We had been ones who guard over them","21:83":"And Job, when he cried out to his Lord: Truly, harm afflicted me and Thou art One Who is Most Merciful of the ones who are merciful","21:84":"So We responded to him. Then, We removed his harm. And We gave him back his people and the like of others with them as a mercy from Us and as a reminder of ones who worship","21:85":"And Ishmael and Enoch and Dhul-Kifl, all were of the ones who remain steadfast","21:86":"And We caused them to enter into Our mercy. They are the ones in accord with morality","21:87":"And Jonah, when he went as one who is enraged, and thought that We would never have power over him. And, then, he cried out through the shadows that: There is no god, but Thou! Glory be to Thee! Truly, I had been of the ones who are unjust","21:88":"So We responded to him. And We delivered him from the lament. And, thus, We rescue the ones who believe","21:89":"And mention Zechariah when he cried out to his Lord: My Lord! Forsake me not unassisted and Thou art Best of the ones who inherit","21:90":"So We responded to him and We bestowed Yahya on him. And We made things right for his spouse and for him. Truly, they had been competing with one another in good deeds and they would call to Us with yearning and reverence. And they had been ones who are humbled before Us","21:91":"And she who guarded her private parts, then, We breathed into her Our Spirit and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds","21:92":"Truly, this, your community, is one community and I am your Lord so worship Me","21:93":"But they cut asunder their affair between them. Yet all of them are ones who return to Us","21:94":"So whoever does as the ones in accord with morality and he is one who believes, then, his endeavoring will not be rejected. And, truly, We will be One Who Inscribes it for him","21:95":"And there is a ban on the town that We caused to perish. They will not return","21:96":"until Gog and Magog are let loose and they slide down from every slope","21:97":"And the true promise will be near. That is when the sight will be that which fixed in horror of those who were ungrateful! O woe to us. Surely, we had been in heedlessness of this. Nay! We had been ones who were unjust","21:98":"Truly, you and what you worship other than God are fuel material for hell. You are the ones who go down to it","21:99":"If these had been gods, they would never have gone down to it. All are ones who will dwell in it forever","21:100":"There will be sobbing in it for them and they, their gods, will not hear in it","21:101":"Truly, those to whom there has preceded the fairer from Us, those are ones who are far removed from it","21:102":"They will not hear even the low sound of it. And they, in that for which their souls lusted, will be ones who will dwell in it forever","21:103":"The greater terror will not dishearten them and the angels will admit them: This is your day that you had been promised","21:104":"On a Day when We roll up the heavens like the rolling up of the written scroll of manuscripts, as We began the first creation, We will cause it to return. It is a promise from Us. Truly, We had been ones who do","21:105":"And, certainly, We wrote down in the Psalms after the Remembrance that the earth will be inherited by My servants—the ones who are in accord with morality","21:106":"Truly, in this is the delivering of this message for the folk, ones who worship","21:107":"And We sent thee not but as a mercy for the worlds","21:108":"Say: It is only revealed to me that your god is One God. Will you, then, be ones who submit to God","21:109":"But if they turned away, then, say: I proclaimed to you all equally. And I am not informed whether what you are promised is near or far","21:110":"Truly, He knows the openly published saying and He knows what you keep back","21:111":"And I am not informed so that perhaps it will be a test for you and an enjoyment for a while","21:112":"He said: My Lord! Give Thou judgment between us with The Truth. And our Lord is The Merciful, He Whose help is being sought against what you allege","22:1":"O humanity! Be Godfearing of your Lord. Truly, the earthquake of the Hour is a tremendous thing. On a Day you will see it","22:2":"every one who is breast feeding will be negligent of whoever she breast fed. And every pregnant woman will bring forth a foetus and thou wilt see humanity intoxicated yet they will not be intoxicated. But the punishment of God will be severe","22:3":"And among humanity is he who disputes about God without knowledge and follows every rebel satan","22:4":"It was written down about him that whoever turned away to him as a friend, truly, he will cause him to go astray and will guide him to the punishment of the blaze","22:5":"O humanity! If you had been in doubt about the Upraising, truly, We created you from earth dust and, again, from seminal fluid and, again, from a clot and, again, from tissue that was formed and that was not formed so that we make it manifest to you. We establish in the wombs whom We will for a term, that which is determined. And, again, We bring you out as infant children and, again, you may reach the coming of age. And among you there is he whom death will call to itself. And among you there is he who is returned to the most wretched lifetime so that he knows not anything after some knowledge. And thou hast seen the earth as that which is lifeless. Yet when We caused water to descend on it, it quivered and it swelled and put forth every lovely pair","22:6":"That is because God, He is The Truth, and it is He Who gives life to the dead and He is Powerful over everything","22:7":"And, truly, the Hour is that which arrives. There is no doubt about it and that God will raise up whoever is in the graves","22:8":"And among humanity is such a one who disputes about God without knowledge nor guidance nor an illuminating Book","22:9":"turning to his side as one who turns away to cause to go astray from the way of God. For him in the present is degradation. And We will cause him to experience—on the Day of Resurrection— the punishment of the burning","22:10":"That is because of what thy two hands put forward! And, truly, God is not unjust to His servants","22:11":"And among humanity is he who worships God on the fringes. If good lit on him, he is at rest with it. And if a test lit on him, he turned completely about. He lost the present and the world to come. That, it is the clear loss","22:12":"He calls to other than God what neither hurts him nor profits him. That, it is a far wandering astray","22:13":"He calls to him whose hurting is nearer than his profiting. Miserable was the defender and miserable was the acquaintance","22:14":"Truly, God will cause to enter those who have believed and did as the ones accord with morality, Gardens beneath which rivers run. Truly, God accomplishes what He wants","22:15":"Whoever had been thinking that God will never help him, in the present and in the world to come, let him stretch out a cord to heaven. Again, let him sever it. Then, let him look on whether his cunning causes to put away what enrages him","22:16":"And, thus, We caused signs to descend, clear portents. And that God guides whom He wants","22:17":"Truly, those who believed and those who became Jews and the Sabeans and the Christians and the Zoroastrians and those who ascribed partners—truly, God will distinguish between them on the Day of Resurrection. Truly, God over everything is a Witness","22:18":"Hast thou not considered that to God prostrates to Him whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in and on the earth and the sun and the moon and the stars, the mountains, the trees and the moving creatures, and many of humanity while there are many on whom the punishment will be realized. And He whom God despises, then, there is no one who honors him. Truly, God accomplishes whatever He wills.‡","22:19":"These two disputants strove against one another about their Lord. Then, for those who were ungrateful garments of fire will be cut out for them. Over their heads, scalding water will be unloosed","22:20":"whereby what is in their bellies will be dissolved and their skins","22:21":"And for them are maces of iron","22:22":"Whenever they wanted to go forth from there because of lament, they will be caused to return to it and experience the punishment of the burning","22:23":"Truly, God will cause to enter those who believed and did as ones in accord with morality, Gardens beneath which rivers run. They are adorned in them with bracelets of gold and pearls. And their garments in it will be of silk","22:24":"And they were guided to what is good of the saying and they were guided to the Path of Him Who is Worthy of Praise","22:25":"Truly, those who were ungrateful and bar from the way of God and from the Masjid al-Haram that We made for humanity—equal for the ones who give themselves up and the ones who are desert dwellers—and whoever wants to violate it with injustice, We will cause him to experience a painful punishment","22:26":"And mention when We placed Abraham in the place of the House that: Thou wilt ascribe nothing as partners with Me. And Thou purify My House for the ones who circumambulate it and the ones who are standing up, and the ones who bow down and the ones who prostrate themselves","22:27":"Announce to humanity the pilgrimage to Makkah. They will approach thee on foot and on every thin camel. They will approach from every deep ravine","22:28":"that they bear witness to what profits them and remember the Name of God on known days over whatever He provided them from flocks of animals. Then, eat of it and feed the ones who are in misery and the poor","22:29":"Again, let them finish their ritual cleanliness and live up to their vows and circumambulate the Ancient House","22:30":"That was commanded! Whoever holds the sacred things of God in honor, then, that is better for him with his Lord. And permitted to you were the flocks, but what will be recounted to you. So avoid the disgrace of graven images and avoid saying the untruth","22:31":"Turn to God as monotheists not with Him as ones who are polytheists. And whoever ascribes partners with God, it is as if he fell down from heaven and the birds snatch him or the wind hurled him to ruin in a place far away","22:32":"That was commanded! Whoever holds the waymarks of God in honor, then, it is, truly, from hearts filled with God-consciousness","22:33":"For you in that is what profits for a term, that which is determined. Again, their place of sacrifice is at the Ancient House","22:34":"And for every community We assigned devotional acts that they may remember the Name of God over what We provided them of flocks of animals. And your God is One God. Submit to Him, and give thou good tidings to the ones who humble themselves","22:35":"those who, when God was remembered, their hearts took notice and the ones who remain steadfast against whatever lit on them and the ones who perform the formal prayer and who spends out of what We provided them","22:36":"We made for you the beasts of sacrifice among the waymarks of God.

And those are not of the ones who believe","24:48":"And when they were called to God and His Messenger to give judgment among them, then, a group of people among them are ones who turn aside","24:49":"But if they would be in the right, they would approach him as ones who are yielding","24:50":"Is there a sickness in their hearts? Or were they in doubt? Or be they fearful that God and His Messenger will be unjust to them? Nay! Those, they are the ones who are unjust","24:51":"The only saying of the ones who believe had been—when they were called to God and His Messenger that He give judgment between them—to say: We heard and obeyed. And those, they are the ones who prosper","24:52":"And whoever obeys God and His Messenger and dreads God and is Godfearing, those, they are the ones who are victorious","24:53":"And they swore by God their most earnest oaths that if thou wouldst command them, they would go forth. Say: Swear not; honorable obedience is better. Truly God is Aware of what you do","24:54":"Say: Obey God and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away, then, on him was only what was loaded on him, and on you was only what was loaded on you. And if you obey him, you will be truly guided. And there is not a duty on the Messenger but the delivering of the clear message","24:55":"God promised those who have believed among you and did as the ones in accord with morality, that He will make them successors in the earth, even as He made of those before them successors and He will establish for them their way of life firmly by which He was content with them and He will substitute a place of sanctuary in place of their fear: They shall worship Me—ascribe nothing as partners with Me. And whoever was ungrateful after that, then, those, they are the ones who disobey","24:56":"And perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms and obey the Messenger so that perhaps you will find mercy","24:57":"Assume not those who were ungrateful that they are ones who will frustrate Him in the region. Their place of shelter will be the fire and how miserable the Homecoming","24:58":"O those who believed! Let them ask permission—those whom your right hands possessed (f) and those who reach not puberty—three times: Before the dawn formal prayer, when you lay down your garments at the time of noon and after the time of night formal prayer. These are the three times of privacy for you. There is not on you nor on them blame after these. Other than these, go about some of you with some others. Thus, God makes manifest to you the signs. And God is Knowing, Wise","24:59":"When infant children were fully grown among you, then, let them ask permission as asked permission those who were before them. Thus, God makes manifest for you His signs. And God is Knowing, Wise","24:60":"And women who are past child-bearing, those who hope not for marriage, there is no blame on them (f) if they lay down their (f) garments, not as ones who flaunt themselves and their (f) adornment. And that they have restraint is better for them (f), and God is Hearing, Knowing","24:61":"There is no fault on the blind nor fault on the lame nor fault on the sick nor on yourselves that you eat from your houses or the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers or the houses of your sisters or the houses of your paternal uncles or the houses of your paternal aunts or the houses of your maternal uncles or the houses of your maternal aunts or of that for which you possess its keys or your ardent friend. There is no blame on you that you eat altogether or separately. But when you entered houses, then, greet one another with a greeting from God, one that is blessed and what is good. Thus, God makes manifest for you the signs so that perhaps you will be reasonable","24:62":"The ones who believe are only those who believe in God and His Messenger. And when they had been with him on a collective matter, they go not until they asked his permission. Truly, those who ask thy permission, those are those who believed in God and His Messenger. So when they ask thy permission for some of their affairs, give permission to whom thou hadst willed of them, and ask God for forgiveness for them. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate","24:63":"The supplication of the Messenger among you is not as the supplication of some of you on some other. Surely, God knows those who slip away under cover. And let those who go against his command beware so that a test should not light on them or a painful punishment not light on them","24:64":"Surely, to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Surely, He knows what you did. And on the Day when they are returned to Him, then, He will tell them what their hands did, and God is Knowing of everything","25:1":"Blessed be He Who sent down the Criterion between right and wrong to His servant so that he be a warner to the worlds","25:2":"He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Who takes not to Himself a son. There be no ascribed associate with Him in the dominion. And He created everything and ordained it a foreordaining","25:3":"Yet they took gods to themselves other than Him who create nothing and are themselves created. And they neither possess for themselves hurt nor profit nor have they dominion over death, nor this life, nor rising up","25:4":"And those who were ungrateful said: This is nothing but a calumny he devised and other folk assisted him. So, surely, they brought about injustice and untruth","25:5":"And they said: Fables of the ancient ones that he caused to be written down! And they are to be related from memory to him at early morning dawn and eventide","25:6":"Say: It was caused to descend by He who knows the secret in the heavens and the earth. Truly, He had been Forgiving, Compassionate","25:7":"And they said: What Messenger is this that he eats food and walks in the markets? Why was an angel not caused to descend to him to be a warner with him","25:8":"Or why is not a treasure cast down to him or why is there not a garden for him so that he may eat from it? And the ones who are unjust said: You follow nothing but a bewitched man","25:9":"Look on how they propounded for thee parables for they went astray and are not able to find a way","25:10":"Blessed be He Who, had He willed, assigned for thee better than that, Gardens beneath which rivers run and He will assign for thee palaces","25:11":"Nay! They denied the Hour. And We made ready a blaze for whoever denied the Hour","25:12":"When it saw them from a far place, they heard it raging furiously and roaring","25:13":"And when they were cast down into it, a troubling place, ones who are chained, they called for damnation","25:14":"It will be said to them: Call not today for a single damnation, but call for many damnations","25:15":"Say: Is that better or the Garden of Infinity that was promised the ones who are Godfearing? It had been a recompense for them and a Homecoming","25:16":"For them in it will be whatever they will, ones who will dwell in it forever. That had been from thy Lord a promise, one that is besought","25:17":"And on the Day He will assemble them and what they worship other than God. To them He will say: Was it you who caused these My servants to go astray? Or went they astray from the way","25:18":"They would say: Glory be to Thee! It had not been fit and proper for us to take to ourselves any protectors other than Thee. But Thou hadst given them enjoyment and their fathers until they forgot the Remembrance and had been a lost folk","25:19":"So, surely, they denied you in what you say. Then, you will neither be able to turn away from it, nor help. And whoever does wrong among you, We will cause him to experience the great punishment","25:20":"And We sent not before thee any ones who are sent but that, truly, they eat food and walk in the markets. And We made some of you as a test for some others. Will you endure patiently, and thy Lord had been Seeing","25:21":"Those who hope not for a meeting with Us said: Why were angels not caused to descend to us and why see we not our Lord? Surely, they grew arrogant among themselves, defiant, turning in great disdain","25:22":"On a Day they will see the angels there will be no good tidings for the ones who sin. And they will say: Unapproachable! Banned","25:23":"We will advance on whatever actions they did. We will make them as scattered dust","25:24":"The Companions of the Garden on that Day will have the best resting place and the fairer place of noonday rest","25:25":"On a Day when heaven will be split open with the cloud shadows and the angels were sent down, a sending down successively","25:26":"on that Day the true dominion will belong to The Merciful. And it will be a Day difficult for the ones who are ungrateful","25:27":"And on a Day when one who is unjust will bite his hands, he will say: Would that I took myself to a way with the Messenger","25:28":"Ah! Woe is me! Would that I take not to myself so-and-so as a friend","25:29":"Certainly, he caused me to go astray from the Remembrance after it drew near me. And Satan had been a betrayer of the human being","25:30":"And the Messenger said: O my Lord! Truly, my folk took this, the Quran to themselves, as that which is to be abandoned","25:31":"And, thus, We assigned for every Prophet an enemy of the ones who sin. And thy Lord sufficed as one who guides and as a helper","25:32":"And those who were ungrateful said: Why was the Quran not sent down to him all at once? Thus, We will make firm thy mind by it. And We chanted a chanting","25:33":"And they bring thee no parable. We brought about The Truth to thee and fairer exposition","25:34":"Those who will be assembled on their faces in hell, those are worse placed, ones who go astray from the way","25:35":"And, certainly, We gave Moses the Book and assigned his brother Aaron to him as a minister","25:36":"And We said: You both go to the folk who denied Our signs. Then, We destroyed them, an utter destruction","25:37":"And the folk of Noah when they denied the Messengers, We drowned them. And We made them as a sign for humanity. And We made ready for the ones who are unjust a painful punishment","25:38":"and Ad and Thamud and the Companions of Rass and many generations in between that","25:39":"And We propounded parables for each of them. And We shattered each a shattering","25:40":"And, certainly, they approached the town where the reprehensible rain was rained down on them. Is it that they see it not? Nay! They had been not hoping for any rising up","25:41":"And when they saw thee, they take thee to themselves but in mockery: Is this the one whom God raised up as a Messenger","25:42":"He was about to cause us to go astray from our gods, if it were not that we endured patiently in them! And they will know at the time when they see the punishment, who is one who goes astray from the way","25:43":"Hadst thou considered him who took to himself his own desires as his god? Wouldst thou, then, be over him a trustee","25:44":"Or assume thou that most of them hear or are reasonable? They are not but as flocks. Nay! They are ones who go astray from a way","25:45":"Hast thou not considered how thy Lord stretched out the shade? If He willed, He would make it a place of rest. Again, We made the sun an indicator over it","25:46":"Again, We seized it to Us an easy seizing","25:47":"And it is He Who made the nighttime a garment for you and sleep a rest and made the daytime for rising","25:48":"And it is He Who sent the winds, bearers of good tidings in advance of His Mercy. And We caused to descend undefiled water from heaven","25:49":"that We give life by it to a lifeless land and with it We satiate. We created flocks on it and many humans","25:50":"And, certainly, We diversified among them so that they recollect. Then, most of humanity refused everything, but disbelief","25:51":"And if We willed, We would have raised up a warner in every town","25:52":"So obey not the ones who are ungrateful and struggle against them thereby with a great struggle","25:53":"And it is He Who let forth the two seas—this, agreeable and water of the sweetest kind and this, salty, bitter. He made between the two that which was unapproachable, a banned barrier","25:54":"And it is He Who created a mortal from water and made for him kindred by blood and kin by marriage. And thy Lord had been ever Powerful","25:55":"And they worship other than God what neither profits them nor hurts them. And the one who is ungrateful had been ever a sustainer against his Lord","25:56":"And We sent thee not, but as one who gives good tidings and as a warner","25:57":"Say: I ask of you no compensation for this but that whoever willed should take himself on a way to his Lord","25:58":"And put thy trust in the Living Who is Undying and glorify His praise. And He sufficed to be aware of the impieties of His servants","25:59":"He Who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between the two in six days, again, He turned His attention to the Throne. The Merciful! Ask the aware, then, about Him","25:60":"And when it was said to them: Prostrate yourselves to The Merciful, they said: And what is The Merciful? Will we prostrate ourselves to what thou hast commanded us? And it increased aversion in them.‡","25:61":"Blessed be He Who made constellations in the heaven and made in it a light-giving lamp and an illuminating moon","25:62":"And He it is Who made the nighttime and the daytime to follow in succession for who wanted to recollect, or who wanted thankfulness","25:63":"And the servants of The Merciful are those who walk on the earth in meekness. And when the ones who are ignorant addressed them, they said: Peace","25:64":"And those who spend the night with their Lord as ones who prostrate themselves and are upright","25:65":"and those who say: Our Lord! Turn Thou away the punishment of hell from us. Truly, its punishment will be continuous torment","25:66":"How evil a habitation and resting place","25:67":"And those who, when they spent, neither exceed all bounds, nor are they tightfisted, but had been between that, a just stand","25:68":"Those who call not to another god with God nor kill the soul which God forbade but rightfully, nor commit adultery. And whoever disregards and commits this will meet sinfulness","25:69":"The punishment will be multiplied for him on the Day of Resurrection. And he will dwell in it forever, as one who is despised","25:70":"Whoever has repented and believed and whose actions were done as one in accord with morality, for those God will substitute for their evil deeds benevolence. And God had been Forgiving, Compassionate","25:71":"And whoever repented and did as one in accord with morality, he, truly, repents to God, turning in repentance","25:72":"And those who bear not witness to untruth and if they passed by idle talk, they passed by nobly","25:73":"and those who, when they were reminded of the signs of their Lord, fall not down unwilling to hear and unwilling to see","25:74":"and those who say: Our Lord! Bestow on us from our spouses and our offspring the comfort of our eyes and make us leaders of the ones who are Godfearing","25:75":"those will be given recompense in the highest chambers because they endured patiently. They will be in receipt of greetings and peace","25:76":"ones who will dwell in it forever. Excellent it is for habitation and as a resting place","25:77":"Say: My Lord would not concern Himself with you if it had not been for your supplication, for, surely, you denied so it will be close at hand","26:1":"S M\\m","26:2":"That are the signs of the clear Book","26:3":"Perhaps thou wouldst be one who consumes thyself in grief because they become not ones who believe","26:4":"If We will, We send down to them from heaven a sign so that perhaps their necks would stay to it, ones that are bent in humility","26:5":"And there approaches them not any renewed Remembrance from The Merciful but that they had been ones who turn aside from it","26:6":"Surely, they denied it. So soon the tiding will approach them about what they had been ridiculing","26:7":"Consider they the earth, how much We caused to develop in and on it of every generous pair","26:8":"Truly, in that is a sign. Yet most of them had not been ones who believe","26:9":"Truly, thy Lord, He is, certainly, The Almighty, The Compassionate","26:10":"And when thy Lord proclaimed to Moses saying that: Approach the unjust folk","26:11":"a folk of Pharaoh saying: Will they not be Godfearing","26:12":"He said: My Lord! Truly, I fear that they will deny me","26:13":"and my breast be narrowed and my tongue will not be loosened. So send for Aaron","26:14":"And they charge an impiety against me. I fear that they will kill me","26:15":"He said: No indeed! Both of you go with Our signs. Truly, We will be with you, ones who are listening","26:16":"And both of you approach Pharaoh and say: We are the Messengers of the Lord of the worlds","26:17":"so send the Children of Israel with us","26:18":"Pharaoh said: Raise not we thee up among us as a child? Hadst thou not lingered in expectation with us for many years of thy lifetime","26:19":"And thou hadst accomplished thy accomplishment that thou hadst accomplished and thou art among the ones who are ungrateful","26:20":"Moses said: I accomplished it when I was of the ones who go astray","26:21":"So I ran away from you when I feared you. Then, my Lord bestowed on me critical judgment and made me among the ones who are sent","26:22":"Beyond this past favor with which thou hast reproached me, thou hadst enslaved the Children of Israel","26:23":"Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the worlds","26:24":"Moses said: The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between the two of them if you had been ones who are certain","26:25":"Pharaoh said to whoever was around him: Listen you not","26:26":"Moses said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers, the ancient ones","26:27":"Pharaoh said: Truly, your Messenger who was sent to you is one who is possessed","26:28":"Moses said: The Lord of the East and the West and whatever is between the two of them if you had been reasonable","26:29":"Pharaoh said: If thou hadst taken to thyself a god other than me. I will, certainly, assign thee to be imprisoned","26:30":"Moses said: What if I drew near thee with something that makes it clear","26:31":"Pharaoh said: Bring it, if thou hast been among the ones who are sincere","26:32":"So he cast his staff; that is when it was a clear serpent","26:33":"And he drew out his hand and that is when it was shimmering white to the ones who look","26:34":"He said to the Council around him: Truly, this is one who is a knowing sorcerer","26:35":"He wants to drive you out from your region by his sorcery. What is it, then, that you suggest","26:36":"They said: Put him and his brother off and raise up ones who summon in the cities","26:37":"They will bring every knowing witch to thee","26:38":"So the ones who were sorcerers were gathered at a time appointed on a known day","26:39":"and it was said to humanity: Will you, you be ones who gather together","26:40":"so that perhaps we follow the ones who are sorcerers if they had been the ones who are victors","26:41":"So when the ones who are sorcerers drew near, they said to Pharaoh: Is there a compensation for us if we had been the ones who are victors","26:42":"Pharaoh said: Yes! Truly, you will be the ones who are brought near to me","26:43":"Moses said to them: Cast what you will as ones who cast","26:44":"So they cast their ropes and their staffs and said: By the vainglory of Pharaoh, we, we will, surely, be the ones who are victors","26:45":"Then, Moses cast down his staff. That is when it swallows what they faked","26:46":"The ones who are sorcerers were cast down, ones who prostrate themselves","26:47":"They said: We believed in the Lord of the worlds","26:48":"the Lord of Moses and Aaron","26:49":"Pharaoh said: You believed in him before I give permission to you? He is, truly, your foremost master who taught you sorcery. Then, you will know. I will, certainly, cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will cause you to be crucified one and all","26:50":"They said: No grievance. Truly, to our Lord we are ones who are turning","26:51":"Truly, we are desirous that Our Lord forgive us our transgressions that we had been the first of the ones who believe","26:52":"And We revealed to Moses saying that: Set thou forth by night with My servants. Truly, you are ones who will be followed","26:53":"Then, Pharaoh sent to the cities, ones who summon","26:54":"They said: These are, truly, a small crowd","26:55":"and, truly, they are ones who enrage us","26:56":"We are altogether, truly, ones who are cautious","26:57":"So We drove them out from the gardens and springs","26:58":"and treasures and a generous station","26:59":"And We, thus, gave them as inheritance to the Children of Israel","26:60":"So they pursued them at sunrise","26:61":"Then, when the two multitudes sighted each other, the Companions of Moses said: Truly, we are ones who are to be overtaken","26:62":"Moses said: No indeed. Truly, my Lord is with me and He will guide me","26:63":"Then, We revealed to Moses saying that: Strike the sea with thy staff and it divided and each had been a separate part like a high, tremendous mountain","26:64":"And, again, We brought the others close","26:65":"and We rescued Moses and whoever was with him, one and all","26:66":"Again, We drowned the others","26:67":"Truly, in this is a sign and yet most of them had not been ones who believe","26:68":"And, truly, thy Lord, He is The Almighty, The Compassionate","26:69":"And recount to them the tidings of Abraham","26:70":"when he said to his father and his folk: What is it you worship","26:71":"They said: We worship idols. We will stay ones who give ourselves up to them","26:72":"He said: Hear they when you call them","26:73":"Or are they profiting you or hurting you","26:74":"They said: Nay! But we found our fathers acting likewise","26:75":"He said: Then, considered what you had been worshipping","26:76":"you and your fathers, the elders","26:77":"Truly, they are an enemy to me, but not so the Lord of the worlds","26:78":"Who created me. And it is He Who guides me","26:79":"And that He Who feeds me and gives me drink","26:80":"And when I was sick, it is He Who heals me","26:81":"and Who causes me to die, again, will give me life","26:82":"and from Whom I am desirous that He will forgive me my transgressions on the Day of Judgment","26:83":"My Lord! Bestow on me critical judgment and cause me to join with the ones in accord with morality","26:84":"And assign me a good name of good repute with the later ones","26:85":"and make me one who inherits the Garden of Bliss","26:86":"And forgive my father. Truly, he had been among the ones who go astray","26:87":"And cover me not with shame on a Day they will be raised up","26:88":"on a Day neither wealth will profit nor children","26:89":"but he who approached God with a pure-hearted heart","26:90":"And the Garden will be brought close for the ones who are Godfearing","26:91":"and hellfire will be advanced for the ones who are in error","26:92":"And it will be said to them: Where is what you had been worshipping","26:93":"instead of God? Are you helped by them? Or help they themselves","26:94":"Then, they were thrown down into it, they and the ones who are in error","26:95":"and the army of Iblis, one and all","26:96":"And they said while they are in it striving against one another","26:97":"By God! Truly, we had been clearly wandering astray","26:98":"when we made you equal with the Lord of the worlds","26:99":"And no one caused us to go astray but the ones who sin","26:100":"Now we have not ones who are intercessors","26:101":"nor an ardent friend, a loyal friend","26:102":"Would that there were for us a return again. Then, we would be among the ones who believe","26:103":"Truly, in this is a sign; yet most of them had not been ones who believe","26:104":"And, truly, thy Lord, He is The Almighty, The Compassionate","26:105":"The folk of Noah denied the ones who are sent","26:106":"when their brother, Noah, said to them: Will you not be Godfearing","26:107":"Truly, I am a trustworthy Messenger to you","26:108":"so be Godfearing of God and obey me","26:109":"And I ask you not for any compensation for it.

Deliver me and my people from what they do","26:170":"So We delivered him and his people one and all","26:171":"but an old woman of the ones who stay behind","26:172":"Again, We destroyed the others","26:173":"and We rained down on them a rain. And how evil was the rain for the ones who are warned","26:174":"Truly, in this is a sign. Yet most of them had not been ones who believe","26:175":"And, truly, thy Lord, He is, certainly, The Almighty, The Compassionate","26:176":"The Companions of the Thicket denied the ones who are sent","26:177":"When Shuayb said to them: Will you not be Godfearing","26:178":"Truly, I am a trustworthy Messenger to you","26:179":"so be Godfearing of God and obey me","26:180":"And I ask you not for any compensation for it. My compensation is only from the Lord of the worlds","26:181":"Live up to the full measure and be not of the ones who cause loss to others by fraud","26:182":"And weigh with a straight scale","26:183":"and diminish not to humanity their things nor do mischief in or on the earth as ones who make corruption","26:184":"And be Godfearing of Him Who created you and the array of the ancient ones","26:185":"They said: Thou art only ones against whom a spell is cast","26:186":"And thou art nothing but a mortal like us. And, truly, we think thee to be among the ones who lie","26:187":"So cause pieces of heaven to drop on us, if you had been among the ones who are sincere","26:188":"He said: My Lord is greater in knowledge of what you do","26:189":"But they denied him. So took them the punishment on the overshadowing day. Truly, that had been the punishment of a tremendous Day","26:190":"Truly, in this is a sign. Yet most of them had not been ones who believe","26:191":"And, truly, thy Lord, He is, certainly, The Almighty, The Compassionate","26:192":"And this, truly, is the sending down successively of the Lord of the worlds","26:193":"that the Trustworthy Spirit brought down","26:194":"on thy heart that thou be among the one who warn","26:195":"in a clear Arabic tongue","26:196":"And, truly, it is in the ancient scrolls of the ancient ones","26:197":"Would it not be a sign for them that is known to the knowing among the Children of Israel","26:198":"And if We sent it down to some of the non-Arabs","26:199":"and he recited it to them, they had not been ones who believe in it","26:200":"Thus, We thrust it into the hearts of the ones who sin","26:201":"They will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment","26:202":"Then, it will approach them suddenly while they are not aware","26:203":"Then, they will say: Are we ones who are given respite","26:204":"Seek they to hasten Our punishment","26:205":"Hadst thou considered that if We gave them enjoyment for years","26:206":"and, again, there drew near them what they had been promised","26:207":"they would not be availed by what they had been given of enjoyment","26:208":"We caused no town to perish but that it had ones who warn","26:209":"as a reminder. And We had not been ones who are unjust","26:210":"It came not forth by the satans","26:211":"and neither is it fit and proper for them nor are they able","26:212":"Truly, they, from having the ability to hear, are the ones who are set aside","26:213":"So call thou not to any god with God so that thou be among the ones who are punished","26:214":"And warn thy nearest kin, the kinspeople","26:215":"And make low thy wing to whoever followed thee among the ones who believe","26:216":"Then, if they rebelled against thee, then, say: Truly, I am free of what you do","26:217":"And put thy trust in The Almighty, The Compassionate","26:218":"Who sees thee at the time thou hast stood up","26:219":"and thy going to and fro of the ones who prostrate themselves","26:220":"Truly, He is The Hearing, The Knowing","26:221":"Will I tell you in whom the satans come forth","26:222":"They come forth in every sinful false one who gives listen","26:223":"but most of them are ones who lie","26:224":"As for the poets, the ones who are in error follow them","26:225":"Hast thou not considered that they wander in every valley","26:226":"and that they say what they accomplish not","26:227":"But those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality remembered God frequently and helped themselves after they were wronged. And those who did wrong will know by which overturning they will be turned about","27:1":"That are the signs of the Quran and a clear Book","27:2":"a guidance and good tidings for the ones who believe","27:3":"those who perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms so that they of the world to come, they are certain","27:4":"Truly, as for those who believe not in the world to come, We made their actions appear pleasing to them so that they wander unwilling to see","27:5":"Those are those for whom is the dire punishment and they, in the world to come, they are the ones who are the losers","27:6":"And, truly, thee, thou art in receipt of the Quran, that which proceeds from the Presence, Wise, Knowing","27:7":"Mention when Moses said to his people: Truly, I, I observed a fire! I will bring you news from it or I will approach you with a flaming firebrand so that perhaps you would warm yourselves","27:8":"But when he drew near it, it was proclaimed that: Blessed be He Who is in the fire and Who is around it, and glory be to God, the Lord of the worlds","27:9":"O Moses! Truly, I alone am God, The Almighty, The Wise","27:10":"Cast down thy staff. But when he saw it quiver as if it were a snake, he turned as one who draws back to retrace his steps. O Moses! Fear not! The ones who are sent fear not My nearness","27:11":"but whoever did wrong does. Again, he substituted goodness after evil and, truly, I am Forgiving, Compassionate","27:12":"Cause thy hand to enter into thy bosom. It will go forth shimmering white without evil. These are among nine signs to Pharaoh and his folk. Truly, they had been a folk, ones who disobey","27:13":"But when Our signs drew near them, ones who perceive, they said: This is clear sorcery","27:14":"And they negated them—although their souls confessed to them—out of injustice and self-exaltation. So look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who make corruption","27:15":"Certainly, We gave David and Solomon knowledge; and they said: All Praise belongs to God Who gave us advantage over many of His servants, ones who believe","27:16":"And Solomon inherited from David and he said: O humanity! We were taught the utterance of the birds and everything was given to us. Truly, this is clearly grace","27:17":"And there was assembled before Solomon his armies of jinn and humankind and birds and they are marching in rank","27:18":"until when they approached the Valley of the Ants. One ant said: O ants! Enter your dwellings so that Solomon and his armies not crush you while they are not aware","27:19":"So Solomon smiled as one who laughs at its saying and he said: My Lord! Arouse me that I give thanks for Thy divine blessing with which Thou wert gracious to me and ones who are my parents and that I do as one in accord with morality. May Thou be well-pleased and cause me to enter by Thy Mercy among Thy servants, ones in accord with morality","27:20":"And he reviewed the birds and said: Why see I not the hoopoe bird? Had it been among the ones who are absent","27:21":"I will, certainly, punish him with a severe punishment or deal a death blow to it unless it brings me a clear authority","27:22":"But it was not long in coming. Then, it said: I comprehended what thou hast not comprehended of it. And I drew near thee from Sheba with certain tidings","27:23":"Truly, I found a woman controlling them. And she was given everything and for her is a sublime throne","27:24":"I found her and her folk prostrating herself to the sun—instead of God—and Satan made to appear pleasing to them their actions and barred them from the way so they are not truly guided","27:25":"So they prostrate themselves not to God Who brings out that which is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you speak openly","27:26":"God, there is no god but He, the Lord of the Sublime Throne.‡","27:27":"Solomon said: We will look on if thou hadst been sincere or thou art of the ones who lie","27:28":"Go thou with this letter of mine and cast it to them. Again, turn away from them and look on what they return","27:29":"She said: O Council! Truly, a generous letter was cast down to me","27:30":"Truly, it is from Solomon and, truly, it is in the Name of God, The Merciful, The Compassionate","27:31":"Rise not up against me, but approach me as ones who submit to God","27:32":"She said: O Council! Render me an opinion in my affair. I had not been one who resolves unless you bear witness","27:33":"They said: We are imbued with strength and vigorous might, but the command is for thee. So look on what thou wilt command","27:34":"She said: Truly, when kings entered a town, they made corruption in it and made the most mighty of its people humiliated in spirit. Thus, this is what they accomplish","27:35":"But, truly, I am one who will send to them a present and will be one who looks with what returns the ones who are sent","27:36":"So when they drew near Solomon, he said: Are you furnishing me relief with wealth? What God gave me is better than what He gave you. Nay! It is you who should be glad with your present","27:37":"Return thou to them and We, truly, will approach them with armies against which they will not be capable and we will drive them out from there as ones who are disgraced and they, humble-spirited","27:38":"He said: O Council! Which of you will bring me her throne before they approach me as ones who submit to God","27:39":"A demon from among the jinn said: I will bring it to thee before thou wilt stand up from thy station. And, truly, I am strong, trustworthy","27:40":"Said he who has knowledge of the Book: I will bring it to thee before thy glance goes back to thee. And, then, when he saw that which is settled before him, he said: This is from the grace of my Lord to try me whether I give thanks or am ungrateful. And whoever gave thanks, truly, he gives thanks for himself. And whoever was ungrateful, then, truly, my Lord is Rich, Generous","27:41":"He said: Disguise her throne for her that we look on whether she will be truly guided or she will be of those who are not truly guided","27:42":"So when she drew near, it was said: Is thy throne like this? She said: It is as though it had been it. Solomon said: The knowledge was given us before her and we had been ones who submit to the One God","27:43":"She was barred from worshipping God by what she had been worshipping other than God for, truly, she had been of a folk, ones who are ungrateful","27:44":"It was said to her: Enter the pavilion. And when she saw it, she assumed it to be a pool and she bared her legs. He said: Truly, it is a smooth, crystal pavilion. She said: My Lord! Truly, I did wrong to myself and I submitted with Solomon to God, the Lord of the worlds","27:45":"And, certainly, We sent to Thamud their brother, Salih that they worship God! Then, when they became two groups of people striving against one another","27:46":"he said: O my folk! Why seek you to hasten the evil deed before benevolence? Why ask you not for forgiveness of God so that perhaps you will find mercy","27:47":"They said: We auger ill of thee and whoever is with thee. He said: That which is your omen is with God. Nay! You are a folk who are being tried","27:48":"And there had been nine groups of persons in the city who make corruption in the earth and make not things right","27:49":"They said: Swear to one another by God: We will, certainly, attack him by night and his people. Again, we will, certainly, say to his protector: We bore not witness to the destruction of his people and, truly, we are ones who are sincere","27:50":"So they planned a plan and We planned a plan while they were not aware","27:51":"So look on how had been the Ultimate End of their planning! Truly, We destroyed them and their folk one and all","27:52":"And that are their houses, ones that have fallen down for what they did wrong? Truly, in this is a sign for a folk who know","27:53":"And We rescued those who believed and had been Godfearing","27:54":"And Lot, when he said to his folk: You approach indecency and you perceive what you do","27:55":"Why approach you men with lust instead of women? Nay! You are a folk who are ignorant","27:56":"Then, there had been no answer by his folk, but that they said: Drive the people of Lot out from your town. Truly, they are a clan to cleanse themselves","27:57":"So We rescued him and his people, but his woman. We ordained her to be among the ones who stay behind","27:58":"And We rained down on them a rain. How evil was the rain to the ones who are warned","27:59":"Say: The Praise belongs to God and peace be on His servants, those whom He favored. Is God better or what they ascribe as partner with God","27:60":"Who created the heavens and the earth and caused to descend for you from the heavens, water? With it We caused joyous, fertile gardens to develop. It had not been for you to cause their trees to develop. Is there any god besides God? Nay! They are a folk who equate others with God","27:61":"Who made the earth a stopping place and made rivers in the midst and made firm mountains for it and made between the two sees that which hinders? Is there a god besides God? Nay! But most of them know not","27:62":"Who answers one who is constrained when he called to Him and He removes the evil and assigns you as vice-regents on the earth? Is there a god besides God? Little is what you recollect","27:63":"Who guides you in the shadows of the dry land the sea and Who sends the winds, bearer of good news in advance of His mercy? Is there a god besides God? Exalted is God above partners they ascribe with God","27:64":"Who begins creation, again, will cause it to return and Who provides you from the heaven and the earth. Is there a god besides God? Say: Prepare your proof if you had been ones who are sincere","27:65":"Say: None knows who is in the heavens and the earth, nor the unseen but God. Nor are they aware when they will be raised up","27:66":"Nay! Their knowledge of the world to come failed. Nay! They are in uncertainty about it. Nay! They are in the dark about it","27:67":"And those who were ungrateful said: When we had been earth dust like our fathers will we, truly, be ones who are brought out","27:68":"Certainly, we were promised this, we and our fathers before. Truly, this is nothing but fables of the ancient ones","27:69":"Say: Journey through the earth; then, look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who sin","27:70":"And feel thou not remorse for them, nor be troubled by what they plan","27:71":"And they say: When is the promise if you had been ones who are sincere","27:72":"Say: Perhaps coming close behind you be some of that which you seek to hasten","27:73":"And, truly, thy Lord is Possessor of Grace for humanity, but most of them give not thanks","27:74":"And, truly, thy Lord knows what their breasts hide and what they speak openly","27:75":"Not is that which is absent in the heaven and the earth, but that it is in the clear Book","27:76":"Truly, this, the Quran, relates about the Children of Israel and most of what they are at variance in it","27:77":"And, truly, it is a guidance and a mercy for the ones who believe","27:78":"Truly, thy Lord will decree between them with His determination. And He is The Almighty, The Knowing","27:79":"So put thy trust in God. Truly, thou art on The Clear Truth","27:80":"Truly, thou wilt not cause the dead to hear nor wilt thou cause to hear the unwilling to hear the calling to them when they turned as ones who draw back","27:81":"Nor wilt thou be one who guides the unwilling to see out of their fallacy. Thou wilt not cause to hear, but whoever believes in Our signs and so they are ones who submit to God","27:82":"And when the saying fell on them, We will bring out a moving creature for them from the earth that will speak to them, that: Humanity had not been certain of Our signs","27:83":"And on a Day We will assemble a unit out of every community of whoever denies Our signs and they will be marching in rank","27:84":"Until when they drew near, He will say: Denied you My signs without comprehending them in knowledge, or what is it that you had been doing","27:85":"And the saying will fall on them because they did wrong. And they will speak nothing for themselves","27:86":"Considered they not? We made the nighttime for them to rest in it and the daytime for ones who perceive. Truly, in that are signs for a folk who believe","27:87":"On a Day on which the trumpet will be blown, whoever is in the heavens will be terrified and whoever is on the earth, but him whom God willed. And all will approach Him as ones who are in a state of lowliness","27:88":"And thou wilt see the mountains thou hast assumed to be that which are fixed. But they will pass by as the passing of the clouds. This is the handiwork of God Who created everything very well. Truly, He is Aware of what you accomplish","27:89":"Whoever drew near with benevolence, for him will be better than it and they would be from the terror ones who are safe on that Day","27:90":"And whoever drew near with evil deeds, they would be slung on their faces in the fire: Are you given recompense but for what you had been doing","27:91":"Truly, I was commanded to worship the Lord of this land which He made sacred and to Whom everything belongs. And I was commanded that I be among the ones who submit to God","27:92":"and to recount the Recitation. So whoever was truly guided, then, he is truly guided only for himself. And to whoever went astray say: Truly, I am among the ones who warn","27:93":"And say: The Praise belongs to God. He will cause you to see His signs and you will recognize them. Thy Lord is not One Who is Heedless of what you do","28:1":"a S M\\m","28:2":"That are the signs of the clear Book","28:3":"We recount to thee the tiding of Moses and Pharaoh with The Truth for a folk who believe","28:4":"Truly, Pharaoh exalted himself on the earth and made his people partisans, taking advantage of due to their weakness, a section among them. He slaughters their children and saves alive their women. Truly, he had been of the ones who make corruption","28:5":"And We want to show grace to those who were taken advantage of due to their weakness on the earth and to make them leaders and to make them the ones who inherit","28:6":"and to establish them firmly on the earth. And We cause Pharaoh and Haman to see—and their armies from them— that of which they had been fearful","28:7":"And We revealed to the mother of Moses: Breast feed him. But if thou hadst feared for him, then, cast him into the water of the sea and neither fear nor feel remorse. Truly, We will be ones who restore him to thee, ones who make him among the ones who are sent","28:8":"Then, the people of Pharaoh picked him out to be an enemy to them and a cause of grief. Truly, Pharaoh and Haman and their armies had been ones who are inequitable","28:9":"And the woman of Pharaoh said: He will be a comfort to our eyes for me and for thee. Kill him not. Perhaps he may profit us or we may take him to ourselves as a son. But they are not aware","28:10":"And it came to be in the morning that the mind of the mother of Moses was that which is empty. Truly, she was about to show him, if We had not invigorated her heart so that she became among the ones who believe","28:11":"And she said to his sister: Track him. So she kept watching him from afar while they are not aware","28:12":"And We forbade any breast feeding female for him before. Then, she said: Shall I point you to the people of a house who will take control of him for you and they will be ones who will look after him","28:13":"So We returned him to his mother that her eyes settle down and she not feel remorse and that she knows that the Promise of God is true. But most of them know not","28:14":"And when he was fully grown, come of age and he straightened himself up, We gave him critical judgment and knowledge. And, thus, We give recompense to the ones who are doers of good","28:15":"And he entered the city at a time of heedlessness of its people. He found in it two men fighting one against the other. This who was from among his partisans and this who was from among his enemies. The one who was among his partisans cried for help against him who was among his enemies. So Moses struck him with his fist and Moses made an end of him. He said: This is the action of Satan. Truly, he is a clear enemy, one who leads astray","28:16":"He said: My Lord! Truly, I did wrong to myself so forgive me and He forgave him. Truly, He is The Forgiving, The Compassionate","28:17":"He said: My Lord! For that with which Thou wert gracious to me I will never be a sustainer of the ones who sin","28:18":"So he came to be in the morning in the city one who is fearful and is vigilant. That is when the one who had asked for help yesterday cries out aloud to him. Moses said to him: Truly, thou art clearly a hothead","28:19":"Then, when he wanted to seize by force the one who he was an enemy of both of them—he said: O Moses! Wouldst thou want to kill me as thou hadst killed a soul yesterday? Thou wouldst want nothing, but to be haughty on the earth? And thou wouldst want not to be among the ones who make things right","28:20":"A man drew near from the farther part of the city, coming eagerly, he said: O Moses! Truly, the Council is conspiring against thee to kill thee, so go forth. Truly, I am the one who gives advice to thee","28:21":"So Moses went forth from there as one who is fearful, is vigilant. He said: My Lord! Deliver me from the folk, ones who are unjust","28:22":"When of his own accord he turned his face toward Midian he said: Perhaps my Lord guides me to the right way","28:23":"And when he went down to the well of Midian, he found a community there of personages drawing water and he found other than them two women who keep away. He said: What is your business? They both said: We draw not water until the ones who are shepherds move on. And our father is an aged, old man","28:24":"So he drew water for them. Again, he turned away to the shade and said: My Lord! Truly, I am, certainly, of whatever Thou caused to descend of good to me, in need","28:25":"Then, drew near him one of the two women, walking bashfully. She said: Truly, my father calls to thee that he may give thee recompense of compensation because thou hadst drawn water for us. So when he drew near him and related to him the narrative, he said: Fear not. Thou wert delivered from the folk, ones who are unjust","28:26":"One of the two women said: O my father! Employ him. Truly, best is that thou wouldst employ the strong, the trustworthy","28:27":"He said: Truly, I want to wed thee to one of my two daughters if that thou wilt hire thyself to me for eight years. But if thou wert to fulfill ten years, then, it will be from thee, for I want not to press thee hard. Thou wilt find me, if God willed, among the ones in accord with morality","28:28":"He said: That is between thee and between me whichever of the two terms I satisfied. There will be no deep seated dislike from me. And God is Trustee over what we say","28:29":"Then, when Moses satisfied the term and journeyed with his people, he observed at the edge of the mount a fire. He said to his people: Abide! Truly, I, I observed a fire so that perhaps I will bring you some news from there or burning wood of fire so that perhaps you will warm yourselves","28:30":"So when he approached it, it was proclaimed from the right side of the ridge of the valley, in a corner of the blessed ground from the tree: O Moses! Truly, I am God, the Lord of the worlds","28:31":"Cast thy staff. But when he saw it quiver as if it were a snake, he turned as one who draws back, and he retraces his steps. O Moses! Come forward and fear not. Truly, thou art among the ones who are safe","28:32":"Insert thy hand into thy bosom. It will go forth shimmering white without evil and clasp thy arm pits against fright. These are two proofs from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his Council. Truly, they had been a folk, ones who disobey","28:33":"He said: My Lord! Truly, I killed a soul among them and I fear that they will kill me","28:34":"And my brother Aaron, he is more oratorical in language than I, so send him with me as a helpmate to establish me as true. Truly, I fear that they will deny me","28:35":"He said: We will strengthen thy arm through thy brother and assign to you both authority so that they reach not out to you both. With Our signs, you two and whoever followed you two will be the ones who are victors","28:36":"Then, when Moses drew near them with Our signs, clear portents, they said: This is nothing but forged sorcery. We heard not of this from our fathers, the ancient ones","28:37":"Moses said: My Lord is greater in knowledge of who drew near with guidance from Him and what will be the Ultimate End in the Abode. Truly, the ones who are unjust will not prosper","28:38":"And Pharaoh said: O Council! I knew not of any god for you other than me so kindle for me, O Haman, a fire on the clay and make a pavilion for me so that perhaps I will peruse the God of Moses. And, truly, I think that he is among the ones who lie","28:39":"And he grew arrogant, he and his armies, on the earth without right and they thought that they would not be returned to Us","28:40":"So We took him and his armies and We cast them forth in the water of the sea. So look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who are unjust","28:41":"We made them leaders. They call to the fire. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will not be helped","28:42":"And a curse pursued them in the present. And on the Day of Resurrection they will be of the ones who are spurned","28:43":"And, certainly, We gave Moses the Book, after We caused previous generations to perish as clear evidence for humanity and a guidance and a mercy so that they recollect","28:44":"And thou hadst not been on the western edge when We decreed the command to Moses and thou hadst not been among the ones who bear witness","28:45":"But We caused generations to grow and their lifetimes continued to be long. And thou hadst not been one who is a dweller with the people of Midian who recount Our signs to them, but it is We Who had been ones who send","28:46":"And thou hadst not been at the edge of the mount when We proclaimed, but as a mercy from thy Lord, that thou wast to warn a folk to whom no warner approached them before thee so that perhaps they will recollect","28:47":"So that if affliction lights on them for what their hands put forward, they say: Our Lord! Why hadst Thou not sent a Messenger to us that we would have followed Thy signs and we would be among the ones who believe","28:48":"But when The Truth drew near them from Us they said: Why was he not given the like of what was given to Moses? They are ones who are ungrateful for what was given to Moses before. They said: Two kinds of sorcery, each helped one against the other. And they said: Truly, we disbelieve in all of it","28:49":"Say: Then, bring a Book from God that is better guided than these two that I follow it, if you had been ones who are sincere","28:50":"But if they respond not to thee, then, know that they only follow their own desires. And who is one who goes astray than whoever followed his own desires without guidance from God? Truly, God guides not the folk, the ones who are unjust","28:51":"And, certainly, We caused the saying to reach them so that perhaps they will recollect","28:52":"Those to whom We gave the Book before it, they believe in it","28:53":"And when it is recounted to them, they say: We believed in it. Truly, it is The Truth from our Lord. Truly, even before it we had been ones who submit to God","28:54":"Those will be given their compensation two times because they patiently endured and drive off evil deeds with benevolence and they spend out of what We provided them","28:55":"And when they heard idle talk, they turned aside from it and said: To us are our actions and to you are your actions. Peace be to you! We are not looking for the ones who are ignorant","28:56":"Truly, thou hast not guided whom thou hast loved but God guides whomever He wills. And He is greater in knowledge of the ones who are truly guided","28:57":"They said: If we follow the guidance with thee, we would be snatched away from our region. Establish We not firmly for them a holy, safe place where all kinds of fruits are collected as provision from that which proceeds from Our Presence? But most of them know not","28:58":"And how many a town that We caused to perish boasted about its livelihood. And these are their dwellings, not to be inhabited after them but a little. And, truly, We, We had been the ones who inherit","28:59":"Thy Lord had not been One Who Causes towns to perish until He raises up to their mother-town a Messenger who recounts Our signs to them. We never had been Ones Who Cause towns to perish unless their people are ones who are unjust","28:60":"And whatever things you were given are enjoyment for this present life and its adornment. And what is with God is better for one who endures. Will you not, then, be reasonable","28:61":"Is he to whom We promised a fairer promise—and it is one that reaches fulfillment—like him to whom We gave the enjoyment of enjoyment for this present life? Again, on the Day of Resurrection he will be among the ones who are charged","28:62":"And on that Day He will proclaim to them and will say: Where are My ascribed associates whom you had been claiming","28:63":"They would say about whom will be realized the saying: Our Lord! These are they whom we led into error. We led them into error even as we erred. We clear ourselves with Thee. They had never been worshipping us","28:64":"And it would be said: Call to your ascribed associates. Then, they will call to them, but they will not respond to them and they will see the punishment. If only they had been truly guided","28:65":"And on a Day when He would proclaim to them and He would say: What have you answered to the ones who are sent","28:66":"Then, the tidings of that day will be in darkness and they will not demand anything of one another","28:67":"As for him who repented and believed and did as one in accord with morality, then, perhaps he will be among the ones who prosper","28:68":"And thy Lord creates whatever He wills and chooses. Not for them had there been a choice.

Will you not, then, perceive","28:73":"And it is out of His mercy that He assigned for you the nighttime and the daytime that you rest in it and that you be looking for His grace and so that perhaps you will give thanks","28:74":"And on a Day He will proclaim to them and say: Where are My ascribed associates whom you had been claiming","28:75":"And We will tear out a witness from every community and We will say: Prepare your proof. Then, they will know that The Truth is with God and will go astray from them what they had been devising","28:76":"Truly, Korah had been of the folk of Moses, but he was insolent towards them. And We gave him of the treasures which truly, the keys of it were a heavy ordeal to many imbued with strength. Mention when His folk said to him: Exult not. Truly, God loves not the exultant","28:77":"Look for what God gave thee for the Last Abode. And forget not thy share of the present and do good even as God did good to thee. And be not insolent, corrupting in and on the earth. Truly, God loves not the ones who make corruption","28:78":"Korah said: I was only given it because of the knowledge with me. Knows he not that God caused to perish before him some of the generations who were more vigorous in strength than he and more numerous in multitude yet the ones who sin will not be asked about their impieties","28:79":"So he went forth to his folk in his adornment. And said those who want this present life: O would that we had the like of what was given to Korah! Truly, he is the possessor of a sublime allotment","28:80":"And those who were given the knowledge said: Woe to you! The reward for good deeds from God is better for whoever believed and did as ones in accord with morality. And none will be in receipt of it, but the ones who remain steadfast","28:81":"So We caused to swallow him the earth and his abode! Then, there had been not any faction to help him against God. And he had been of the ones who are helpless","28:82":"And it came to be in the morning those who had coveted his place but yesterday, say: God extends the provision to whomever He wills of His servants and confines it to whomever He wills. Were it not that God showed grace to us, He would have caused the earth to swallow us; O how the ones who are ungrateful will not prosper","28:83":"This is the Last Abode that We will assign to those who want not self-exaltation in the earth, nor corruption. And the Ultimate End is for the ones who are Godfearing","28:84":"Whoever brought about benevolence, for him there will be better than it.

Truly, God is Powerful over everything","29:21":"He punishes whom He wills and has mercy on whom He wills. And to Him you will come back","29:22":"You will not be ones who frustrate Him on the earth nor in the heaven and there is not for you, other than God, either a protector or a helper","29:23":"And those who disbelieved in the signs of God and the meeting with Him, those gave up hope of My mercy and those, for them there will be a painful punishment","29:24":"So the answer of his folk had been not but that they said: Kill him or burn him! Then, God rescued him from the fire. Truly, in this are, certainly, signs for a folk who believe","29:25":"And he said: You take only to yourselves graven images instead of God because of affection among yourselves for this present life. Again, on the Day of Resurrection some of you will disavow some others and some of you will curse some others and your place of shelter will be the fire. And for you there will be no ones who help","29:26":"So Lot believed in him.• And Abraham said: Truly, I am one who emigrates for my Lord. Truly, He, He is The Almighty, The Wise","29:27":"And We bestowed Isaac and Jacob on him and We assigned to his offspring prophethood and the Book. We gave him his compensation in the present. And, truly, in the world to come he will be, certainly, among the ones in accord with morality","29:28":"And Lot, when he said to his folk: Truly, you approach indecency which none who preceded you committed in the worlds","29:29":"You approach men with lust and sever the way and approach that which is unlawful in your conclave.

He said: O my folk! Worship God and hope for the Last Day and do not mischief in and on the earth as ones who make corruption","29:37":"And they denied him. So the quaking of the earth took them and it came to be in the morning in their abodes, ones who are fallen prostrate","29:38":"And Ad and Thamud, surely, it became clear to you from their dwellings. Satan made their actions appear pleasing to them and barred them from the way and they had been ones who see clearly","29:39":"And Korah and Pharaoh and Haman and, certainly, Moses drew near to them with the clear portents, but they grew arrogant on the earth and they had not been ones who take the lead from Us","29:40":"So We took each of them in his impiety. And of them was he on whom We sent a sand storm and of them was he whom the Cry took and of them was he whom We caused the earth to swallow and of them were some whom We drowned.

God breaks not His Promise, but most of humanity knows not","30:7":"They know only that which is manifest in this present life. And of the world to come, they are ones who are heedless","30:8":"Or if they reflect not in themselves, God created not the heavens and the earth and whatever is between the two but with The Truth and for a term that is determined. And, truly, most of humanity, in the meeting with their Lord, are, certainly, ones who disbelieve","30:9":"Or journey they not through the earth and look on how had been the Ultimate End of those who were before them? They had been superior to them in strength. And they plowed the earth and frequented it more than they frequented it. And drew near them their Messengers with the clear portents.

Thus, We explain distinctly the signs to a folk who are reasonable","30:29":"Nay! Those who did wrong followed their own desires without knowledge. Then, who will guide whom God caused to go astray? And they will not have ones who help","30:30":"So set thy face towards a way of life as a monotheist. It is the nature originated by God in which He originated humanity. There is no substitution for the creation of God. That is the truth-loving way of life, but most of humanity knows not","30:31":"Be ones who turn in repentance to Him and be Godfearing and perform the formal prayer and be not among the ones who are polytheists","30:32":"or of those who separated and divided their way of life and had been partisans, each party is glad with what they have","30:33":"And when harm afflicted humanity, they call to their Lord as ones who turn in repentance to Him. When He caused them, again, to experience His mercy, that is when a group of people among them ascribe partners with their Lord","30:34":"for they are ungrateful for what We gave them. Then, take joy; you will know","30:35":"Or caused We to descend to them an authority that it assert what they had been ascribing as partners with Him","30:36":"And when We caused humanity to experience mercy, they were glad of it.

And what you gave in purifying alms, wanting the Countenance of God, then, those, they are the ones who will receive manifold","30:40":"God is He Who created you. Again, He provided for you and, again, He will cause you to die. Again, He will give you life. Is there among your ascribed associates with Him who accomplish anything of that? Glory be to Him! Exalted is He above partners they ascribe","30:41":"Corruption was manifested on the dry land and the sea because of what the hands of humanity earned. He causes them to experience some of what they did, so that perhaps they will return repentant","30:42":"Say: Journey through the earth; then, look on how had been the Ultimate End of those who were before. Most of them had been ones who are polytheists","30:43":"So set thy face to the truth-loving way of life before that Day approaches from God and there is no turning back. They will be split up on that Day","30:44":"Whoever was ungrateful, his ingratitude is on him. Whoever did as one in accord with morality will be arranging provision for themselves","30:45":"And He gives recompense to those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality from His grace. Truly, He loves not the ones who are ungrateful","30:46":"Among His signs are that He sends the winds as ones that give good tidings and causes you to experience His mercy and so that the boats run at His command and that you be looking for His grace so that perhaps you will give thanks","30:47":"And, certainly, We sent Messengers before thee to their own folk. They drew near them with the clear portents. Then, We requited those who sinned. And it had been an obligation on Us to help ones who believe","30:48":"God is He Who sends the winds so they raise clouds. He extends them in the heaven how He wills and He makes them into pieces until thou hast seen rain drops go forth from their midst. That is when He lit it on whomever He wills of His servants. That is when they rejoice at the good tidings","30:49":"And, truly, they had been—even before it is sent down on them—before that, ones who are seized with despair","30:50":"Look on the effects of the mercy of God, how He gives life to the earth after its death! Truly, that! He is One Who Gives Life to the dead and He is Powerful over everything","30:51":"And if We sent a wind and they saw fields, ones that are yellowing, they would stay ungrateful after that","30:52":"Then, truly, thou wilt not cause the dead to hear nor wilt thou cause the unwilling to hear, to hear the calling to them when they turned as ones who draw back","30:53":"And thou art not one who guides the unwilling to see from their fallacy. Thou hast caused none to hear but those who believe in Our signs. And they are ones who submit to God","30:54":"God is He Who created you in your weakness. Again, after that weakness, He assigned strength; again, after that strength, He assigned weakness and grayness of hair. And He creates what He wills. And He is The Knowing, The Powerful","30:55":"And on a Day when the Hour is secured for you, the ones who sin will swear that they lingered in expectation not but an hour.

This is the Day of Upraising, but you had not been knowing","30:57":"So on that Day will not profit them, those who did wrong, their excuses nor will they ask to be favored","30:58":"And, certainly, We propounded for humanity in this, the Quran, every kind of parable.

And he takes it to himself in mockery. Those, for them will be a despised punishment","31:7":"When Our signs are recounted to him, he turned as one who grows arrogant, as if he had not been hearing them, as if there had been heaviness in his ears. So give him the good tidings of a painful punishment","31:8":"Truly, those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, for them are Gardens of Bliss","31:9":"ones who will dwell in them forever. The promise of God is true. And He is The Almighty, The Wise","31:10":"He created the heavens without any pillars so that you see the heavens.

Truly, association with God is, certainly, a tremendous injustice","31:14":"And We charged the human being about ones who are his parents. His mother carried him in feebleness on feebleness and his weaning is in two years. Give thanks to Me and to ones who are thy parents. And to Me is the Homecoming","31:15":"But if they both struggled with thee that thou hast ascribed partners with Me of what for thee is no knowledge, then, obey them not. And keep their company in the present as one who is honorable but follow the way of him who was penitent to Me.

Truly, God loves not any proud boaster","31:19":"And be moderate in thy walking and lower thy voice. Truly the most horrible of voices is, certainly, the voice of the donkey","31:20":"Consider you not that God caused to become subservient to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth and lavished on you His divine blessing, that which is manifest and that which is inward and yet most of humanity is he who disputes about God without knowledge and with no guidance and without an illuminating Book","31:21":"And when it was said to them: Follow what God caused to descend. They said: Nay! We will follow what we found our fathers on. Even if it Satan had been calling them to the punishment of the blaze","31:22":"And whoever submits his face to God while he is one who is a doer of good, then, surely, he held fast to the most firm handhold.

And for whomever God causes to go astray, there is not anyone who guides","40:34":"And, certainly, Joseph drew near you before with the clear portents, but you ceased not in uncertainty as to what he brought about to you. Until when he perished you said: God will never raise up a Messenger after him. Thus, God causes him to go astray, one who is excessive, one who is a doubter","40:35":"those who dispute the signs of God without any authority having approached them. It is troublesome, repugnant with God and with those who believed. Thus, God sets a seal on every heart of one who increases in pride, haughtiness","40:36":"And Pharaoh said: O Haman! Build for me a pavilion so that perhaps I will reach the routes","40:37":"the routes to the heavens, and that I may peruse The God of Moses but, truly, I think that he is one who lies. Thus, it was made to appear pleasing to Pharaoh, the evil of his actions. And he was barred from the way. And the cunning of Pharaoh was not but in defeat","40:38":"And he who believed said: O my folk! Follow me; I will guide you to the way of rectitude","40:39":"O my folk! Truly, this present life is nothing but transitory enjoyment and that the world to come is the stopping place, the Abode","40:40":"Whoever did an evil deed will not be given recompense but the like of it. But whoever did as one in accord with morality, whether male or female, and such is one who believes, then, those will enter the Garden where they will be provided in it without reckoning","40:41":"And O my folk! What is it to me that I call to you for deliverance and you call to me for the fire","40:42":"You call to me to be ungrateful to God and to ascribe partners with Him of what there is no knowledge, while I call you to The Almighty, The Forgiver","40:43":"Without a doubt what you call me to has no merit. It is not a call to the present or to the world to come. And our turning back is to God. And, truly, the ones who are excessive, they will be Companions of the Fire","40:44":"And you will remember what I say to you. I commit my affair to God. Truly, God is Seeing of the servants","40:45":"So God guarded him from the evil deeds that they planned while surrounded the people of Pharaoh an evil punishment","40:46":"The fire to which they are presented the first part of the day and evening. And on a Day when the Hour is secure it is said: Cause the people of Pharaoh to enter the severest punishment","40:47":"And when they dispute with one another in the fire, the weak will say to those who grew arrogant: Truly, we had been followers of you so will you be ones who avail us from a share of the fire","40:48":"Those who grew arrogant would say: Truly, we are all in it. Truly, God, surely, gave judgment among His servants","40:49":"And those in the fire would say to ones who are keepers of hell: Call to your Lord to lighten the punishment for us for a day","40:50":"They would say: Be bringing not your Messengers the clear portents. They would say: Yea! They would say: Then, you call. And the supplication of the ones who are ungrateful only goes astray","40:51":"Truly, We will, certainly, help Our Messengers and those who believed in this present life and on a Day when the ones who bear witness will stand up","40:52":"a Day when their excuses will not profit the ones who are unjust. And for them will be the curse and for them will be an evil abode","40:53":"And, certainly, We gave Moses the guidance and We gave as inheritance to the Children of Israel the Book","40:54":"as a guidance and a reminder for those imbued with intuition","40:55":"So have thou patience. Truly, the promise of God is true. And ask for forgiveness for thy impiety. And glorify thy Lord with praise in the evening and the early morning","40:56":"Truly, those who dispute about the signs of God without any authority having approached them, there is nothing but having pride in their breasts. They will never be ones who reach its satisfaction. So seek refuge in God. Truly, He, He is The Hearing, The Seeing","40:57":"Certainly, the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of humanity, yet most of humanity knows not","40:58":"Not on the same level are the unwilling to see and the seeing nor those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality and the ones who are evil doers. Little do they recollect","40:59":"Truly, the Hour is that which arrives. There is no doubt about it, yet most of humanity believes not","40:60":"And your Lord said: Call to Me; I will respond to you. Truly, those who grow arrogant toward My worship, they will enter hell as ones who are in a state of lowliness","40:61":"God is He Who made for you the nighttime so that you may rest in it and the daytime for one who perceives. Truly, God is Possessor of Grace to humanity, but most of humanity gives not thanks","40:62":"That is God, your Lord, the One Who is Creator of everything. There is no god but He. Then, how you are misled","40:63":"Thus, are misled those who had been negating the signs of God","40:64":"God is He Who made the earth for you as a stopping place and the heaven as a canopy. And He formed you and formed you well and He provided you of what is good. That is God, your Lord. Then, blessed be God, the Lord of the worlds","40:65":"He is The Living! There is no god but He! So call to Him, ones sincere and devoted in the way of life to Him. The Praise belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds","40:66":"Say: Truly, I was prohibited from worshipping those whom you call to other than God, because the clear portents drew near me from my Lord. And I was commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds","40:67":"He it is Who created you from earth dust, again, from seminal fluid, again, from a clot. Again, He brings you out as infant children. Again, you come of age and are fully grown. Again, you be an old man. And of you is he whom death calls to itself before, and that you reach a term, that which is determined so that perhaps you will be reasonable","40:68":"He it is Who gives life and causes to die. And when He decreed an affair, He only says to it: Be! Then, it is","40:69":"Hast thou not considered those who dispute about the signs of God, where they are turned away","40:70":"Those who denied the Book and that with which We sent Our Messengers? Then, they will know","40:71":"When yokes are on their necks and the chains, they will be dragged","40:72":"into scalding water. Again, they will be poured forth into the fire as fuel","40:73":"Again, it will be said to them: Where are what you had been ascribing as partners","40:74":"other than God? They would say: They went astray from us. Nay! We be not calling to anything before. Thus, God causes to go astray ones who are ungrateful","40:75":"That was because you had been exultant on the earth without right and that you had been glad","40:76":"Enter the doors of hell as ones who will dwell in it forever. Then, miserable it will be as a place of lodging for the ones who increase in pride","40:77":"So have thou patience. Truly, the promise of God is true. And whether We cause thee to see some part of what We promise them or We call thee to Us, then, it is to Us they will be returned","40:78":"And, certainly, We sent Messengers before thee among whom We related to thee and of whom We relate not to thee. And it had not been for any Messenger that he bring a sign, except with the permission of God. So when the command of God drew near, the matter would be decided rightfully. And lost here are these, the ones who deal in falsehood","40:79":"God is He Who has made for you flocks among which you may ride on them and among which you eat of them","40:80":"And you have what profits from them and that with them you reach the satisfaction of a need that is in your breasts and you are carried on them and on boats","40:81":"And He causes you to see His signs. So which of the signs of God do you reject","40:82":"Journey they not through the earth and look on how had been the Ultimate End of those before them? They had been more than them and were more vigorous in strength and in regard to the traces they left on the earth. Then, availed them not what they had been earning","40:83":"Then, when their Messengers drew near them with the clear portents, they were glad in the knowledge that they had and surrounded them was what they had been ridiculing","40:84":"So when they saw Our might, they said: We believed in God alone and we were ungrateful in that we had been ones who are polytheists","40:85":"But their belief be not what profits them once they saw Our might. This is a custom of God which was, surely, in force among His servants. And lost here are the ones who are ungrateful","41:1":"M\\m","41:2":"A sending down successively from The Merciful, The Compassionate","41:3":"a Book in which its signs we37:181re explained distinctly, an Arabic Recitation for a folk who know","41:4":"a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, but most of them turned aside so they hear not","41:5":"And they said: Our hearts are sheathed from that to which thou hast called us and in our ears is a heaviness and between us and between thee is a partition. So work. Truly, we, too, are ones who work","41:6":"Say: I am only a mortal like you. It is revealed to me that your God is God, One; so go straight to Him and ask for forgiveness from Him, and woe to the ones who are polytheists—those who give not the purifying alms","41:7":"and who in the world to come are ones who disbelieve","41:8":"Truly, those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, for them will be compensation, that which is unfailing","41:9":"Say: Truly, are you ungrateful to Him Who created the earth in two days? And assign you to Him rivals? That is the Lord of the worlds","41:10":"And He made on it firm mountains from above it and He blessed it and ordained its subsistence within it in four days equally for the ones who ask","41:11":"Again, He turned His attention to the heaven while it was smoke and He said to it and to the earth: Approach both of you willing or unwilling. They both said: We approached as ones who are obedient","41:12":"Then, foreordaining seven heavens in two days, He revealed in each heaven its command. We made the present heaven appear pleasing with lamps and keeping them safe. Thus, decreed the Almighty, The Knowing","41:13":"But if they turned aside, then, say: I warned you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt of Ad and Thamud","41:14":"And when the Messengers drew near before them and from behind them saying: Worship none but God, they said: If our Lord willed, He would have caused angels to descend. Then, truly, in what you were sent, we are ones who disbelieve","41:15":"As for Ad, they grew arrogant on the earth without right and they said: Who is more vigorous than us in strength? Consider they not that God Who created them, He was more vigorous than they in strength? And they had been negating Our signs","41:16":"So We sent on them a raging wind in days of misfortune that We might cause them to experience the punishment of degradation in this present life. And the punishment in the world to come will be more degrading; and they will not be helped","41:17":"And as for Thamud, We guided them, but they embraced blindness of heart instead of guidance. Then, a thunderbolt took them with a humiliating punishment because of what they had been earning","41:18":"We delivered those who believed and had been Godfearing","41:19":"On a Day when will be assembled the enemies of God to the fire, then, they will be marching in rank","41:20":"until when they drew near it. Witness will be borne against them by their having the ability to hear, and by their sight and by their skins as to what they had been doing","41:21":"And they will say to their skins: Why bore you witness against us? They will say: We were given speech by God Who gave speech to all things. And He created you the first time and to Him you will be returned","41:22":"And you had not been covering yourselves so that witness be borne against you by your having the ability to hear or by your sight or by your skins but that you thought that God knows not much of what you do","41:23":"And that your thought, which you thought about your Lord has dealt destruction to you. Then, you became among the ones who are losers","41:24":"Then, even if they endure patiently, yet the fire will be the place of lodging for them. And if they ask for favor, yet they will not be of the ones to whom favor is shown","41:25":"And We allotted for them comrades who were made to appear pleasing to them whatever was before them and whatever was behind them. And the saying was realized against them in communities that passed away before them of jinn and humankind. Truly, they, they had been ones who are losers","41:26":"And those who are ungrateful said: Hear not this, the Quran, but talk idly about it while it is being recited so that perhaps you will prevail","41:27":"We will cause those who were ungrateful to experience a severe punishment. And We will give recompense to them for the bad deeds of what they had been doing","41:28":"That is the recompense of the enemies of God: The fire. For them is the infinite abode in it, recompense because they had been negating Our signs","41:29":"And those who were ungrateful would say: Our Lord! Cause us to see those who caused us to go astray among jinn and humankind. We will lay them both beneath our feet so that they become of the lowest","41:30":"Truly, those who said: Our Lord is God, again, they went straight, the angels come forth to them: Neither fear nor feel remorse, but rejoice in the Gardens which you had been promised","41:31":"We were protectors in this present life and in the world to come. And you will have in it that for which your souls lust and in it is what you call for","41:32":"a hospitality from the Forgiving, Compassionate","41:33":"And who has a fairer saying than he who called to God and did as one in accord with morality, and said: I am one of the ones who submit to God","41:34":"Not on the same level are benevolence or the evil deed. Drive back with what is fairer. Then, behold he who between thee and between him was enmity as if he had been a protector, a loyal friend","41:35":"And none will be in receipt of it but those who endured patiently. And none will be in receipt of it but the possessor of a sublime allotment","41:36":"But if Satan sows enmity, sowing enmity in thee, then, seek refuge in God. Truly, He is The Hearing, The Knowing","41:37":"And of His signs are the nighttime and the daytime and the sun and the moon. Prostrate not yourselves to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to God Who created both of them if it is He you had been worshiping","41:38":"But if they grew arrogant, then, those who are with thy Lord glorify Him during the nighttime and the daytime and they never grow weary.‡","41:39":"And among His signs are that thou hast seen the earth as that which is humble. But when We caused water to descend to it, it quivered and swelled. Truly, He Who gives life to it is the One Who Gives Life to the dead. Truly, He is Powerful over everything","41:40":"Truly, those who blaspheme Our signs are not hidden from Us. Is he who is cast down into the fire better off, or he who approaches as one who is safe on the Day of Resurrection? Do as you willed. Truly, He is Seeing of what you do","41:41":"Truly, those who were ungrateful for the Remembrance when it drew near them are not hidden from Us. And, truly, it is a mighty Book","41:42":"Falsehood approaches it not from before it, nor from behind it. It is a sending down successively from The Wise, The Worthy of Praise","41:43":"Nothing is said to thee but what, truly, was said to the Messengers before thee. Truly, thy Lord is, certainly, the Possessor of Forgiveness, and the Possessor of Painful Repayment","41:44":"And if We made this a non-Arabic Recitation, they would have said: Why were His signs not explained distinctly: A non-Arab tongue and an Arab! Say: It is a guidance for those who believe and a healing. And as for those who believed not, there is a heaviness in their ears and blindness in their hearts. Those are given notice from a far place","41:45":"And, certainly, We gave Moses the Book. Then, they were at variance about it. And if it were not for a Word that had preceded from thy Lord, it would have been decided between them. But, truly, they are in uncertainty, ones in grave doubt about it","41:46":"Whoever did as one in accord with morality, it is for himself. And whoever did evil, it is against himself, and thy Lord is not unjust to His servants","41:47":"To Him is returned the knowledge of the Hour. No fruits go forth from its sheath and no female conceives or brings forth offspring but with His knowledge. And on a Day He will cry out to them: Where are My ascribed associates? They would say: We proclaimed to Thee that none of us was a witness to that","41:48":"Gone astray from them is what they had been calling to before. They would think that there is for them no asylum","41:49":"The human being grows not weary of supplicating for good, but if the worst afflicted him, then, he is hopeless, desperate","41:50":"And, truly, if We caused him to experience mercy from Us, after some tribulation afflicted him, he will, certainly, say: This is due to me. And I think not that the Hour will be one that arises, but if I were returned to my Lord, truly, with Him will be the fairer for me. Then, certainly, We will tell those who were ungrateful of what they did. And We will cause them to experience a harsh punishment","41:51":"And when We were gracious to the human being, he turned aside, withdrew aside. But when the worst afflicted him, then, he is full of supplication","41:52":"Say: Considered you that even though it had been from God, again, you were ungrateful for it. Who is one who goes more astray than he who is in wide breach","41:53":"We will cause them to see Our signs on the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is The Truth. Suffices not thy Lord that, truly, He is Witness over all things","41:54":"They are hesitant about the meeting with their Lord. Truly, He is who One Who Encloses everything","42:1":"M\\m","42:2":"Ayn S Q[f]","42:3":"Thus, He reveals to thee and to those who were before thee, God is The Almighty, The Wise","42:4":"To Him belongs whatever is in and on the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. And He is The Lofty, The Sublime","42:5":"The heavens are about to split asunder from above them while the angels glorify the praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for whoever is on the earth. Truly, God, He is The Forgiving, The Compassionate","42:6":"As for those who took to themselves other than Him as protectors, God is Guardian over them and thou art not a Trustee over them","42:7":"And, thus, We revealed to thee an Arabic Recitation that thou wilt warn the Mother of the Towns and whoever is around it. And warn of the Day of Amassing. There is no doubt about it. A group of people will be in the Garden and a group of people will be in the blaze","42:8":"And if God willed, He would have made them one community but He causes to enter whom He wills into His mercy. And the ones who are unjust, there is not for them either a protector or a helper","42:9":"Or they took other than Him to themselves as protectors. But God, He alone is The Protector. And He gives life to the dead. And He is Powerful over everything","42:10":"Whatever thing about which you were at variance in it, then, its determination is with God. That is God, my Lord in Whom I put my trust and to Him I am penitent","42:11":"One Who is Originator of the heavens and the earth. He made for you spouses of yourselves and of the flocks, pairs by which means He makes you numerous in it. There is not like Him anything.

And if it were not for a Word that preceded from thy Lord—until a term, that which is determined—it would be decided between them. And, truly, those who were given as inheritance the Book after them are in uncertainty, in grave doubt about it","42:15":"Then, for that, call to this. And go thou straight as thou wert commanded. And follow not their desires. And say: I believed in what God caused to descend from a Book. And I was commanded to be just among you. God is our Lord and your Lord.

And to Him is the Homecoming","42:16":"And those who argue with one another about God, after He was assented to, their disputations are null and void with their Lord, and on them is His anger. And for them will be a severe punishment","42:17":"It is God Who caused the Book to descend with The Truth and the Balance. And what causes thee to recognize it so that perhaps the Hour is near","42:18":"Seeking to hasten are those who believe not in it. Those who believed are ones who are apprehensive of it. And they know that it is The Truth, those who altercate, truly, about the Hour are, certainly, going far astray","42:19":"God is Subtle with His servants. He provides to whom He wills. And He is The Strong, The Almighty","42:20":"Whoever had been wanting cultivation of the world to come, We increase his cultivation for him.

Were it not for a decisive word, it would be decided among them. And, truly, the ones who are unjust, for them is a painful punishment","42:22":"Thou wilt see the ones who are unjust as ones who are apprehensive of what they earned and it is that which falls on them. And those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, are in the well-watered meadows of the Gardens. For them will be whatever they will from their Lord. That it is the great grace","42:23":"That is what God gives as good tidings to His servants who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality. Say: I ask you not for compensation, but for the affection for any kin. And whoever gains benevolence, We will increase for him goodness in it. Truly, God is Forgiving, Most Ready to Appreciate","42:24":"Or they say: He devised against God a lie. But if God wills He would have sealed over thy heart. And God blots out falsehood and verifies The Truth by His Words. Truly, He is Knowing of what is in the breasts","42:25":"And He accepts the remorse of His servants and pardons their evil deeds. And He knows what you accomplish","42:26":"And He responds to those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, and increases them of His grace. And as for the ones who are ungrateful, theirs will be a severe punishment","42:27":"And if God extended the provision for His servants, they would be insolent in the earth, but He sends down by measure whatever He wills. Truly, He is The Aware, The Seeing of His servants","42:28":"And He it is Who sends down plenteous rain water after they despaired and He unfolds His mercy. And He is The Protector, The Worthy of Praise","42:29":"And among His signs are the creation of the heavens and the earth and whatever of moving creatures He disseminated in them. And He has the power of amassing them when He wills","42:30":"And whatever affliction lit on you is because of what your hands earned. And He pardons much","42:31":"And you are not ones who frustrate Him on the earth. And there is not for you other than God either a protector or a helper","42:32":"And among His signs are the ones that run on the sea like landmarks","42:33":"If He wills, He stills the wind. Then, they would stay, that which is motionless on the surface. Truly, in that are signs for every enduring and grateful one","42:34":"Or He wreck them because of what they earned.

And what is with God is better and is that which endures for those who believed and put their trust in their Lord","42:37":"and those who avoid the major sins and the indecencies and they forgive when they were angry","42:38":"and those who responded to their Lord and performed their formal prayer and their affairs are by counsel among themselves, and who spend of what We provided them","42:39":"and those who, when insolence lit on them, they help each other","42:40":"And the recompense for an evil deed is the like of an evil deed. Then, whoever pardoned and made things right, his compensation is due from God. Truly, He loves not the ones who are unjust","42:41":"As whoever helped himself after an injustice, so those, there is not any way against them","42:42":"The way is only against those who do wrong to humanity and are insolent in and on the earth unrightfully. Those, for them is a painful punishment","42:43":"And whoever endured patiently and forgave, truly, that is, certainly, a sign of constancy of affairs","42:44":"And whomever God causes to go astray has no protector apart from Him. And thou wilt see the ones who are unjust when they would see the punishment. They will say: Is there any way of turning it back","42:45":"And thou wilt see them being presented to it as ones who are humbled by a sense of humility looking on with secretive glances. And those who believed will say: Truly, the ones who are losers are those who lost themselves and their people on the Day of Resurrection.

There will be no shelter for you on that Day, nor is there for you any refusal","42:48":"But if they turned aside, We put thee not forward as a guardian over them. It is for thee not but the delivering of the message. And, truly, when We caused the human being to experience mercy from Us, he was glad in it. But when evil deeds light on him—because of what his hands sent—then, truly, the human being is ungrateful","42:49":"To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth.

Truly, will not all affairs come home to God","43:1":"M\\m","43:2":"By the clear Book","43:3":"We, truly, made it an Arabic Recitation so that perhaps you will be reasonable","43:4":"Truly, it is in the essence of the Book from Our Presence, Lofty, Wise","43:5":"Will We turn away the Remembrance from you, overlooking as you had been a folk, ones who are excessive","43:6":"And how many a Prophet sent We among the ancient ones","43:7":"And approaches them not a Prophet, but that they had been ridiculing him","43:8":"Then, We caused to perish the more vigorous in courage than them and the example of the ancient ones passed","43:9":"And, certainly, if thou hadst asked them: Who created the heavens and the earth? They will, certainly, say: The Almighty, The Knowing created them","43:10":"Who made the earth a cradle for you and made in it ways for you so that perhaps you would be truly guided","43:11":"and Who sent down water from heaven in measure.

They do nothing but guess","43:21":"Or gave We them any Book before this so they are ones who hold fast to it","43:22":"Nay! They said: We found our fathers in a community holding to a way of life and we are, truly, in their footsteps ones who are truly guided","43:23":"And, thus, We sent not a warner to any town before thee without ones who are given ease saying: We found our fathers in a community. We are, certainly, ones who imitate their footsteps","43:24":"He said: Even if I brought about better guidance for you than what you found your fathers on. They would say: Truly, we, in that with which you were sent are ones who disbelieve","43:25":"So We requited them. Then, look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who deny","43:26":"Mention when Abraham said to his father and his folk: Truly, I am released from obligation to what you worship","43:27":"other than He Who originated me and, truly, He will guide me","43:28":"And He made it an enduring Word among his posterity, so that perhaps they will return","43:29":"Nay! I gave enjoyment to these and to their fathers until The Truth drew near them and a clear Messenger","43:30":"And when The Truth drew near them, they said: This is sorcery and we are ones who disbelieve in it","43:31":"They said: Why was this, the Quran, not sent down to some eminent man of the two towns","43:32":"Would they divide the mercy of thy Lord? It is We Who divided out among them their livelihood in this present life. Exalted are some of them above some others in degree so that some take to themselves others in their bondage. And the mercy of thy Lord is better than what they gather","43:33":"And were it not that humanity be one community, would We have made for whoever is ungrateful for The Merciful, roofs of silver for their houses, and stairways which they would scale up","43:34":"and for their houses, doors, and couches on which they would recline","43:35":"and ornaments? Yet all this would have been nothing, but enjoyment of this present life. And the world to come with your Lord is for the ones who are Godfearing","43:36":"And whoever withdraws from the Remembrance of The Merciful, We allotted for him a satan, so he is a comrade for him","43:37":"And, truly, they bar them from the way, but they assume that they are ones who are truly guided","43:38":"Then, when he drew near us he would say: Would that there were a distance between me and between thee of two sunrises! Miserable was the comrade","43:39":"And it will never profit you this Day as you did wrong. You will be ones who are partners in the punishment","43:40":"So hast thou caused someone unwilling to hear, to hear or wilt thou guide the unwilling to see, or someone who had been clearly going astray","43:41":"And even if We take thee away, We will, truly, be ones who requite them","43:42":"or We will cause thee to see what We promised them. Then, We are ones who are omnipotent over them","43:43":"So hold thee fast to what was revealed to thee. Truly, thou art on a straight path","43:44":"And, truly, this is a remembrance for thee and thy folk. And you will be asked","43:45":"And ask ones whom We sent before thee of Our Messengers: Made We gods other than the Merciful to be worshiped","43:46":"And, certainly, We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his Council. So he said: Truly, I am a Messenger of the Lord of the worlds","43:47":"But when he drew near them with Our signs, that is when they laugh at them","43:48":"And We cause them not to see any sign, but it was greater than its sister’s sign. And We took them with the punishment so that perhaps they would return","43:49":"And they said: O one who is a sorcerer! Call for us to thy Lord by the compact He made with thee. Truly, We will be ones who are truly guided","43:50":"But when We removed the punishment from them, that is when they break their oath","43:51":"And Pharaoh proclaimed to his folk. He said: O my folk! Is not the dominion of Egypt for me and these rivers run beneath me? Will you not, then, perceive","43:52":"Or am I better than this one who is despicable, who scarcely makes things clear","43:53":"Why were bracelets of gold not cast down on him or the angels drawn near to him as ones who are connected with one another","43:54":"Thus, he irritated his folk. Then, they obeyed him. Truly, they had been a folk, ones who disobey","43:55":"So when they provoked against Us, We requited them and drowned them one and all","43:56":"and We made them a thing of the past and a parable for later ages","43:57":"And when the son of Mary was cited as an example, that is when thy folk cry aloud","43:58":"and said: Are our gods better or is he? They cited him to thee not but to be argumentative. Nay! They are a contentious folk","43:59":"He was but a servant to whom We were gracious, and We made him an example to the Children of Israel","43:60":"And if We will, We would have assigned angels to succeed among you on the earth","43:61":"And, truly, he is with the knowledge of the Hour, so contest not about it and follow Me. This is a straight path","43:62":"And let not Satan bar you. Truly, he is a clear enemy to you","43:63":"And when Jesus drew near with the clear portents, he said: Truly, I drew near you with wisdom and in order to make manifest to you some of that about which you are at variance in it. So be Godfearing of God and obey me","43:64":"Truly, God He is my Lord and your Lord so worship Him. This is a straight path","43:65":"The confederates were at variance among themselves. So woe to those who did wrong from the punishment of a painful Day","43:66":"Looked they on but for the Hour that will approach them suddenly while they are not aware","43:67":"Friends on that Day will be enemies some to some others, but ones who are Godfearing","43:68":"O My servants! This Day there shall be no fear in you nor will you feel remorse","43:69":"It will be said to those who believed in Our signs and had been ones who submit to God","43:70":"Enter the Garden, you and your spouses, to be walking with joy","43:71":"There will be passed around among them platters of gold and goblets. And in it will be whatever souls lust for and all that in which the eyes delight. And you will be ones who dwell in it forever","43:72":"This is the Garden that you were given as inheritance because of what you had been doing","43:73":"For you there will be much sweet fruit from which you will eat","43:74":"Truly, ones who sin will be in the punishment of hell, ones who will dwell in it forever","43:75":"It will not be decreased for them and they will be ones who are seized with despair in it","43:76":"And We did not wrong them, but they had been ones who are unjust","43:77":"And they would cry out: O Malik! Let thy Lord finish us. He would say: Truly, you will be ones who abide","43:78":"Certainly, We brought about The Truth to you, but most of you are ones who dislike The Truth","43:79":"Or fixed they on some affair? Then, We, too, are ones who fix some affair","43:80":"Assume they that We hear not their secret thoughts and their conspiring secretly? Yea! Our messengers are near them writing down","43:81":"Say: If The Merciful had had a son, then, I would be first of the ones who worship","43:82":"Glory be to the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne, from all that they allege","43:83":"So let them engage in idle talk and play until they encounter their Day which they are promised","43:84":"And it is He Who is in the heaven, God, and on the earth, God. And He is The Wise, The Knowing","43:85":"Blessed be He to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour and to Whom you will be returned","43:86":"And those whom they call to possess no power other than Him for intercession, only whoever bore witness to The Truth, and they know","43:87":"And if thou hadst asked them: Who created them? They would, certainly, say: God. Then, how are they misled","43:88":"And his saying: O my Lord! Truly, these are a folk who believe not","43:89":"so overlook them and say: Peace. And they will know","44:1":"M\\m","44:2":"By the clear Book","44:3":"truly, We caused it to descend on a blessed night. Truly, We had been ones who warn","44:4":"Every wise command is made clear in it","44:5":"a command from Us. Truly, We had been ones who send it","44:6":"as a mercy from thy Lord. Truly, He is The Hearing, The Knowing","44:7":"Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. If you had been ones who are certain","44:8":"There is no god but He. It is He Who gives life and causes to die. He is your Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers","44:9":"Nay! They play in uncertainty","44:10":"Then, thou be on the watch for a Day when the heavens will bring a clear smoke","44:11":"overcoming humanity. This is a painful punishment","44:12":"Our Lord! Remove thou the punishment from us! Truly, we are ones who believe","44:13":"What will there be as a reminder for them? A clear Messenger drew near them","44:14":"Again, they turned away from him and they said: He is one who is taught by others, one who is possessed","44:15":"Truly, We are ones who remove the punishment for a little. Truly, you are ones who revert to ingratitude","44:16":"On the Day when We will seize by force with the greatest attack, truly, We will be ones who requite","44:17":"And, certainly, We tried a folk of Pharaoh before them when there drew near them a generous Messenger","44:18":"Give back to me the servants of God, the Children of Israel. Truly, I am a trustworthy Messenger to you","44:19":"And rise not up against God. Truly, I am one who arrives with a clear authority","44:20":"Truly, I took refuge in my Lord and your Lord so that you not stone me","44:21":"But if you believe not in me, then, withdraw","44:22":"So he called on his Lord: Truly, these are a folk, ones who sin","44:23":"He said: Set thou forth with my servants by night. Truly, you will be ones who are followed","44:24":"And leave the sea calmly as it is. Truly, they will be an army, one that is drowned","44:25":"How many they left behind of gardens and springs","44:26":"and crops and generous stations","44:27":"and prosperity in which they had been, ones who are joyful","44:28":"And, thus, We gave it as inheritance to another folk","44:29":"And neither the heavens wept for them nor the earth nor had they been ones who are given respite","44:30":"And, certainly, We delivered the Children of Israel from the despised punishment","44:31":"of Pharaoh. Truly, He had been one who exalts himself and was of the ones who are excessive","44:32":"And, certainly, We chose them with knowledge above the worlds","44:33":"and gave them the signs in which there was a clear trial","44:34":"Truly, these say","44:35":"There is nothing but our first singled out death and we will not be ones who are revived","44:36":"Then, bring our fathers back if you had been ones who are sincere","44:37":"Are they better or a folk of Tubba and those who were before them? We caused them to perish. They, truly, had been ones who sin","44:38":"And We created not the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them as ones who play","44:39":"We created them not but with The Truth but most of them know not","44:40":"Truly, the Day of Decision is the time appointed for them one and all","44:41":"a Day when a defender will not avail another defender at all nor will they be helped","44:42":"but him on whom God had mercy. Truly, He is The Almighty, The Compassionate","44:43":"Truly, the tree of Zaqqum","44:44":"will be the food of the sinful","44:45":"Like molten copper it will bubble in the bellies","44:46":"like boiling, scalding water","44:47":"It will be said: Take him and drag him violently into the depths of hellfire","44:48":"Again, then, unloose over his head the punishment of scalding water","44:49":"Experience this! Truly, thou, thou art seemingly the mighty, the generous","44:50":"Truly, this is what you had been contesting","44:51":"Truly, the ones who are Godfearing will be in the station of trustworthiness","44:52":"among Gardens and springs","44:53":"wearing fine silk and brocade, ones who face one another","44:54":"Thus, it is so. We will give in marriage lovely, most beautiful eyed ones","44:55":"They will call therein for every kind of sweet fruit, ones that are safe","44:56":"They will not experience death with them but the first singled out death. And He will protect them from the punishment of hellfire","44:57":"a grace from thy Lord. That, it is the winning the sublime triumph","44:58":"Truly, We made this easy in thy language so that perhaps they will recollect","44:59":"So be on the watch! Truly, they are ones who watch","45:1":"M\\m","45:2":"The sending down the Book successively is from God, The Almighty, The Wise","45:3":"Truly, in the heavens and the earth are signs for the ones who believe","45:4":"And in your creation and what He disseminates of moving creatures are signs for a folk who are certain","45:5":"the alternation of the nighttime and the daytime and what God caused to descend from the heaven of provision. He gave life with it to the earth after its death and the diversifying of the winds—signs for a folk who are reasonable","45:6":"These are the signs of God We recount to thee with The Truth. Then, in which discourse, after God and His signs, will they believe","45:7":"Woe to every false, sinful one","45:8":"He hears the signs of God being recounted to him. Again, he persists as one who grows arrogant as if he hears them not. So give him good tidings of a painful punishment","45:9":"And if he knew anything about Our signs, he took them to himself in mockery. Those, for them is a despised punishment","45:10":"Behind them there is hell. What they earned will avail them not at all nor whatever they took to themselves other than God as protectors. And for them will be a tremendous punishment","45:11":"This is a guidance. Those who were ungrateful for the signs of their Lord, for them there is a punishment of painful wrath","45:12":"God! It is He Who caused the sea to be subservient to you that the boats may run through it by His command and so that you be looking for His grace and so that perhaps you will give thanks","45:13":"And He caused to be subservient to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. All is from Him. Truly, in that are signs for a folk who reflect","45:14":"Say to those who believed: Forgive those who hope not for the Days of God that He give recompense to a folk according to what they had been earning","45:15":"Whoever did as one in accord with morality, it is for himself and whoever did evil, it is against himself. Again, to your Lord you will be returned","45:16":"And, certainly, We gave the Children of Israel the Book, the critical judgment and the prophethood and We provided them from what is good and We gave them advantage over the worlds","45:17":"and We gave them clear portents of the command. And they are not at variance until after the knowledge drew near them through insolence among themselves. Truly, thy Lord will decree between them on the Day of Resurrection about what they had been at variance in it","45:18":"Again, We assigned thee an open way of the command so follow it and follow not the desires of those who know not","45:19":"Truly, they will never avail thee against God at all. And, truly, the ones who are unjust, some of them are protectors of some others. But God is Protector of the ones who are Godfearing","45:20":"This is a clear evidence for humanity and a guidance and a mercy for a folk who are certain","45:21":"Assumed those who sought to do evil deeds that We will make them equal with those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality? Are their living and dying equal? How evil is the judgment they give","45:22":"And God created the heavens and the earth with The Truth so that every soul would be given recompense for what it earned and they, they will not be wronged","45:23":"Hadst thou considered he who took to himself his own desire as his god and whom God caused to go astray out of a knowledge, sealed over his having the ability to hear and his heart and laid a blindfold on his sight? Who, then, will guide him after God? Will you not, then, recollect","45:24":"And they said: There is nothing, but this present life of ours. We die and we live and nothing causes us to perish but a long course of time. And there is for them not any knowledge. Truly, they are but surmising","45:25":"And when are recounted to them Our signs, clear portents, then, disputation had not been but that they said: Bring our fathers if you had been ones who are sincere","45:26":"Say: God gives you life. Again, He causes you to die. Again, He will gather you on the Day of Resurrection in which there is no doubt but most of humanity knows not","45:27":"And to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. And on a Day that the Hour will be secure, on that Day the ones who deal in falsehood will lose","45:28":"Thou wilt see each community one who crawls on its knees. Each community will be called to its book: This Day you will be given recompense for what you had been doing","45:29":"This is Our Book that speaks for itself against you with The Truth. Truly, We registered what you had been doing","45:30":"Then, as for those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, their Lord will cause them to enter in His mercy. That will be the winning the clear triumph","45:31":"But as for those who were ungrateful: Be not My signs recounted to you? Then, you grew arrogant and you had been a folk, ones who sin","45:32":"And when it was said: Truly, the promise of God is true and the Hour, there is no doubt about it. You said: We are not informed about the Hour. Truly, We think it but an opinion and we are not ones who ascertain it","45:33":"And shown to themselves will be the evil deeds they did. They will be surrounded by what they had been ridiculing","45:34":"It would be said: This Day We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this your Day. Your place of shelter will be the fire and there is not for you any one who helps","45:35":"This is because you took to yourselves the signs of God in mockery and this present life deluded you. So this Day they will not be brought out from there nor will they ask to be favored","45:36":"So The Praise belongs to God, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, and the Lord of the worlds","45:37":"And His is the domination of the heavens and the earth. And He is The Almighty, The Wise","46:1":"M\\m","46:2":"The sending down successively of the Book is from God The Almighty, The Wise","46:3":"We created not the heavens and the earth and whatever is between the two, but with The Truth and for a term, that which is determined. And those who disbelieved in what they were warned about are ones who turn aside","46:4":"Say: Considered you what you call to other than God? Cause me to see what of the earth they created. Have they an association in the heavens? Bring me a Book from before this, or a vestige of knowledge if you had been ones who are sincere","46:5":"And who is one who has gone more astray than one who calls to other than God, one who responds not to him until the Day of Resurrection? And they are of their supplication to them, ones who are heedless","46:6":"And when humanity will be assembled, they will become their enemies and will be ones who disavow their worship","46:7":"And when Our signs are recounted, clear portents, those who were ungrateful for The Truth said when it drew near them: This is clear sorcery","46:8":"Or they say: He devised it. Say: If I devised it, you still possess nothing for me against God. He is greater in knowledge of what you press on about. He sufficed as a Witness between me and between you. And He is The Forgiving, The Compassionate","46:9":"Say: I had not been an innovation among the Messengers, nor am I informed of what will be wreaked on me, nor with you. I follow only what is revealed to me and I am only a clear warner","46:10":"Say: Considered you if this had been from God and you were ungrateful for it and bore witness as one who bears witness from among the Children of Israel to its like and believed in it, yet you grew arrogant, how unjust you are; truly, God guides not the folk, the ones who are unjust","46:11":"Those who were ungrateful said of those who believed: If it had been good, they would not have preceded us towards it. And when they are not truly guided by it, they say: This is a ripe, aged calumny","46:12":"Yet before it was the Book of Moses for a leader and as a mercy. And this is a Book, that which establishes as true in the Arabic language to warn those who did wrong and as good tidings to the ones who are doers of good","46:13":"Truly, those who say: Our Lord is God again, go straight, neither will there be fear in them, nor will they feel remorse","46:14":"Those are the Companions of the Garden, ones who will dwell in it forever as a recompense for what they had been doing","46:15":"And We charged the human being with kindness to ones who are his parents. His mother carried him painfully and she painfully brought him forth. And the bearing of him and the weaning of him are thirty months. When he was fully grown, having come of age and reached forty years he said: My Lord! Arouse me that I may give thanks for Thy divine blessing, that with which Thou wert gracious to me and to ones who are my parents and that I do as one in accord with morality so that Thou be well-pleased and make things right for me and my offspring. Truly, I repented to Thee and, truly, I am of the ones who submit to God","46:16":"Those are those from whom We will receive the fairer of what they did and we will pass on by their evil deeds. They are among the Companions of the Garden. This is the promise of sincerity that they had been promised","46:17":"But he who would say to ones who are his parents a word of disrespect to both of them: Promise you me that I will be brought out when generations before me passed away? And they will both cry to God for help: Woe unto thee! Believe! Truly, the promise of God is true. But he said: This is only the fables of the ancient ones","46:18":"Those are those against whom the saying was realized about the communities that passed away before of the jinn and humankind. Truly, they had been ones who are losers","46:19":"And for each there will be degrees according to what he did and He will pay them their account in full for their actions and they, they will not be wronged","46:20":"On a Day when they will be presented—those who were ungrateful—to the fire, it will be said: You caused what is good to be put away in your present life while you enjoyed it. Then, you will be given recompense with a punishment of humiliation because you had been growing arrogant on the earth without right and because you had been disobeying","46:21":"And remember the brother of Ad when he warned his folk in the curving sandhills. Warnings passed away before and after him saying: Worship nothing but God. Truly, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day","46:22":"They said: Hadst thou drawn near to us to mislead us from our gods? Then, bring us that which thou hast promised us if thou hadst been among the ones who are sincere","46:23":"He said: The knowledge is only with God and I state to you what I was sent with, but I see that you are a folk who are ignorant","46:24":"Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud proceeding towards their valleys, they said: This is a dense cloud, that which gives rain to us. Nay! It is what you seek to hasten, a wind in which there is a painful punishment","46:25":"It will destroy everything at the command of its Lord. So it came to be in the morning nothing was seen but their dwellings. Thus, We give recompense to the folk, ones who sin","46:26":"And, certainly, We established them firmly in what We established you firmly not and We made for them the ability to hear and sight and minds. Yet having the ability to hear availed them not, nor their sight, nor their minds at all since they had been negating the signs of God. And surrounded were they by what they had been ridiculing","46:27":"And, certainly, We caused to perish towns around you and We diversified the signs so that perhaps they will return","46:28":"Then, why helped them not those whom they took to themselves other than God as gods as a mediator. Nay! They went astray from them. And that was their calumny and what they had been devising","46:29":"And when We turned away from thee groups of men or jinn who listen to the Quran, when they found themselves in its presence, they said: Pay heed. And when it was finished, they turned to their folk, ones who warn","46:30":"They said: O our folk! Truly, We heard a Book was caused to descend after Moses, that which establishes as true what was in advance of it. It guides to The Truth and to a straight road","46:31":"O our folk! Answer one who calls to God and believe in Him. He will forgive you your impieties and will grant protection to you from a painful punishment","46:32":"And who answers not to one who calls to God? He is not one who frustrates Him in and on the earth. And there will not be for him other than God any protectors. Those are clearly gone astray","46:33":"Considered they not that God Who created the heavens and the earth and is not wearied by their creation—is One Who Has Power to give life to the dead? Yea! He, truly, is Powerful over everything","46:34":"And on a Day when will be presented those who were ungrateful to the fire saying: Is not this The Truth? They would say: Yea! By our Lord! He will say: Then, experience the punishment because you had been ungrateful","46:35":"So have thou patience as endured patiently those imbued with constancy of the Messengers and let them not seek to hasten the Judgment. As, truly, on a Day they will see what they are promised as if they lingered not in expectation but for an hour of daytime. This is delivering the message! Will any be caused to perish but the folk, the ones who disobey","47:1":"Those who were ungrateful and who barred from the way of God—He caused their actions to go astray","47:2":"And those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality and believed in what was sent down to Muhammad—for it is The Truth from their Lord—He will absolve them of their evil deeds and will make right their state of mind","47:3":"That is because those who were ungrateful followed falsehood, while those who believed followed The Truth from their Lord. Thus, God propounds for humanity their parables","47:4":"So when you met those who were ungrateful, then, strike their thick necks until you gave them a sound thrashing. Then, tie them fast with restraints. And afterwards either have good will towards them or take ransom for them until the war ends, laying down its heavy load. Thus, it is so! But if God willed, He Himself would have, certainly, avenged you. But it is to try some of you with some others. As for those who were slain in the way of God, He will never cause their actions to go astray","47:5":"He will guide them and He will make right their state of mind","47:6":"And He will cause them to enter the Garden with which He acquainted them","47:7":"O those who believed! If you help God, He will help you and make firm your feet","47:8":"As for those who are ungrateful, for them is falling into ruin! And He caused their actions to go astray","47:9":"That is because they disliked what God caused to descend so He caused their actions to fail","47:10":"Journey they not through the earth and look on how had been the Ultimate End of those who were before them? God destroyed them. And for ones who are ungrateful is its likeness","47:11":"That is because God is the Defender of those who believed. And for the ones who are ungrateful, there is no defender of them","47:12":"Truly, God will cause to enter those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, gardens beneath which rivers run. While those who were ungrateful, take joy in eating as the flocks eat, the fire will be the place of lodging for them","47:13":"And how many a town had there been which was stronger in strength than thy town which drove thee out, that We have caused to perish? And there was no one who helps them","47:14":"Is he who had been on a clear portent from his Lord like him for whom was made to appear pleasing his dire actions and they followed their own desires","47:15":"This is the parable of the Garden which was promised the ones who are Godfearing: In it are rivers of unpolluted water and rivers of milk, the taste of which is not modified and rivers of intoxicants delightful to ones who drink and rivers of clarified honey, and in it for them all kinds of fruits and forgiveness from their Lord. Is this like ones who will dwell forever in the fire and they were given scalding water to drink so that it cuts off their bowels","47:16":"And among them are some who listen to thee until when they went forth from thee. They said to those who were given the knowledge: What was that he said just now? Those are those upon whose hearts God set a seal. And they followed their own desires","47:17":"And those who were truly guided, He increased them in guidance and He gave to them their God-consciousness","47:18":"Look they, then, on not but the Hour, that it approach them suddenly? Certainly, its tokens drew near. Then, what will it be like for them when their reminder drew near to them","47:19":"So know thou that there is no god but God and ask forgiveness for thy impieties and also for the males, ones who believe and the females, ones who believe, and God knows your place of turmoil and your place of lodging","47:20":"And those who believed say: Why was a Chapter of the Quran not caused to descend? But when was caused to descend a definitive Chapter of the Quran and fighting was remembered in it, thou hadst seen those who in their hearts is a sickness looking on thee with the look of one who is fainting at death","47:21":"But better for them would be obedience and an honorable saying! And when the affair was resolved, then, if they were sincere to God, it would have been better for them","47:22":"Will it be that if you turned away, you would make corruption in the earth and cut off your ties with blood relations","47:23":"Those are those whom God cursed, so He made them unwilling to hear and their sight, unwilling to see","47:24":"Meditate they not, then, on the Quran or are there locks on their hearts","47:25":"Truly, those who went back—turn their back— after the guidance became clear to them, it was Satan who enticed them and He granted them indulgence","47:26":"That is because they said to those who disliked what God sent down: We will obey you in some of the affair. And God knows what they keep secret","47:27":"Then, how will it be for them when the angels will call them to themselves, striking their faces and their backs","47:28":"That is because they followed what displeased God and they disliked His contentment so He caused their actions to fail","47:29":"Or assumed those who in their hearts is a sickness that God will never bring out their rancor","47:30":"If We will, We would have caused thee to see them. Thou wouldst have recognized them by their mark. But, certainly, thou wilt recognize them by the twisting of sayings. And God knows all your actions","47:31":"And, certainly, We will try you until We know the ones who struggle among you and the ones who remain steadfast and We will try your reports","47:32":"Truly, those who were ungrateful and barred from the way of God and made a breach with the Messenger after guidance became clear to them, they never hurt or profit God at all, but He will cause their actions to fail","47:33":"O those who believed! Obey God and obey the Messenger and render not your actions untrue","47:34":"Truly, those who were ungrateful and barred from the way of God, again, they died while they were ones who are ungrateful, then, God will never forgive them","47:35":"So be not faint and call for peace while you have the upper hand. God is with you and He will never cheat you out of your actions","47:36":"This present life is only a pastime and a diversion. But if you believe and are Godfearing, He will give you your compensation and will not ask of you for your property","47:37":"When He asks it of you and, then, urges persistently, you would be a miser and He will bring out your rancor","47:38":"Lo and behold! These are being called to spend in the way of God, yet among you are some who are misers. And whoever is a miser, then, he is a miser only to himself. God is Sufficient and you are poor. And if you turn away, He will have a folk other than you in exchange. Again, they will not be the like of you","48:1":"Truly, We gave victory to thee, a clear victory","48:2":"that God forgive thee what was former of thy impiety and what remained behind that He fulfill His divine blessing on thee and guide thee on a straight path","48:3":"and that God help thee with a mighty help","48:4":"He it is Who caused the tranquility to descend into the hearts of the ones who believe that they add belief to their belief. And to God belongs the armies of the heavens and the earth. And God had been Knowing, Wise","48:5":"that He causes to enter the males, ones who believe and the females, ones who believe Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever, and that He absolve them of their evil deeds. And that had been with God a winning a sublime triumph","48:6":"And that He punish the males, ones who are hypocrites and the females, ones who are hypocrites and the males, ones who are polytheists and the females, ones who are polytheists, the ones who think an evil thought about God, a reprehensible thought, for them is the reprehensible turn of fortune. And God was angry with them. And He cursed them and prepared hell for them. And how evil a Homecoming","48:7":"And to God belongs the armies of the heavens and the earth. And God had been Almighty, Wise","48:8":"Truly, We sent thee as one who bears witness and one who gives good tidings and as a warner","48:9":"so that you believe in God and His Messenger and that you support him and revere Him and glorify Him at early morning dawn and eventide","48:10":"Truly, those who take the pledge of allegiance to thee, take the pledge of alliance only to God. The hand of God is over their hands. Then, whoever broke his oath, breaks his oath only to the harm of himself.

They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: Who, then, has sway over you against God at all if He wanted to harm you or wanted to bring you profit? Nay! God had been aware of what you do","48:12":"Nay! You thought that the Messenger would never turn about and the ones who believe to their people ever, and that was made to appear pleasing in your hearts. But you thought a reprehensible thought, and you had been a lost folk","48:13":"And whoever believes not in God and His Messenger, truly, We made ready a blaze for the ones who are ungrateful","48:14":"And to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And God had been Forgiving, Compassionate","48:15":"The ones who are left behind will say when you set out to take the gains: Let us follow you. They want to substitute for the assertion of God. Say: You will not follow us. Thus, God said before; then, they will say: Nay! You are jealous of us. Nay! They had not been understanding, but a little","48:16":"Say to the ones who are left behind among the nomads: You will be called against a folk imbued with severe might. You will fight them or they will submit to God. Then, if you obey, God will give you a fairer compensation. But if you turn away as you turned away before, He will punish you with a painful punishment","48:17":"There is neither a fault on the blind, nor a fault on the lame, nor a fault on the sick, and whoever obeys God and His Messenger, He will cause him to enter Gardens beneath which rivers run. And whoever turns away, He will punish him with a painful punishment","48:18":"God was well-pleased with the ones who believe (f) when they take the pledge of allegiance to thee beneath the tree for He knew what was in their hearts and He caused the tranquility to descend on them and He repaid them with a victory near at hand","48:19":"And they will take much gain. And God had been Almighty, Wise","48:20":"God promised you much gain that you will take and He quickened this for you. He limited the hands of humanity from you so that perhaps it will be a sign to the ones who believe and that He guide you to a straight path","48:21":"and other gains which are not yet within your power. Surely, God enclosed them. And God had been over everything Powerful","48:22":"And if those who were ungrateful fought you, they would have turned their backs. Again, they would not have found a protector or a helper","48:23":"This is a custom of God which was, surely, in force before. Thou wilt never find in a custom of God any substitution","48:24":"And He it is who limited their hands from you and your hands from them in the hollow of Makkah after He made you victors over them. And God had been Seeing of what you do","48:25":"They were ungrateful, and they barred you from the Masjid al-Haram, and were ones who detained the sacrificial gift from reaching its place of sacrifice. If it had not been for men, ones who believe, and for women, ones who believe, whom you know not that you tread on them and guilt should light on you without your knowledge. This was so that God may cause to enter into His mercy whomever He wills. If they were clearly apart, separated, We would have punished those who were ungrateful among them with a painful punishment","48:26":"Mention when those who were ungrateful laid zealotry in their hearts, like the zealotry of the Age of Ignorance. Then, God caused to descend His tranquility on His Messenger and on the ones who believe and fastened on them the Word of God-consciousness. They had been with right to it and were more worthy of it. And God had been Knowing","48:27":"Certainly, God was sincere to the dream of His Messenger with The Truth: You will enter the Masjid al-Haram, if God willed, as ones who are safe, as ones who shaved your heads or as ones whose hair is cut short. You will fear not. He knew what you know not and He assigned other than that a victory near at hand","48:28":"He it is Who sent His Messenger with guidance and the way of life of The Truth that He uplift it over all of the ways of life. And God sufficed as a witness","48:29":"Muhammad is the Messenger of God. And those who are with him are severe against the one who is ungrateful, but compassionate among themselves. Thou hast seen them as ones who bow down as ones who prostrate themselves. They are looking for grace from God and contentment. Their mark is on their faces from the effects of prostration. This is their parable in the Torah. And their parable in the Gospel is like sown seed that brought out its shoot, energized. It, then, became stout and rose straight on its plant stalk impressing the ones who sow so that He enrage by them the ones who are ungrateful, God promised those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, for them forgiveness and a sublime compensation","49:1":"O those who believed! Put not yourselves forward in advance of God and His Messenger. And be Godfearing of God. Truly, God is Hearing, Knowing","49:2":"O those who believed! Exalt not your voices above the voice of the Prophet nor publish a saying to him as you would openly publish something to some others so that your actions not be fruitless while you are not aware","49:3":"Truly, those who lower their voices near the Messenger of God, those are those who are ones God put to test their hearts for God-consciousness. For them is forgiveness and a sublime compensation","49:4":"Truly, those who cry out to thee from behind the inner apartments, most of them are not reasonable","49:5":"And if they endured patiently until thou wouldst go forth to them, it would have been better for them. And God is Forgiving, Compassionate","49:6":"O those who believed! If one who disobeys drew near to you with a tiding, then, be clear so that you not light on a folk out of ignorance. Then, you would become ones who are remorseful for what you accomplished","49:7":"Know you that the Messenger of God is of you. If he obeys you in much of the affairs, you would, certainly, fall into misfortune. But God endeared belief to you and made it appear pleasing to your hearts. And He caused to be detestable to you ingratitude and disobedience and rebellion. Those, they are the ones who are on the right way","49:8":"This is a grace from God and His divine blessing. And God is Knowing, Wise","49:9":"And if two sections among the ones who believe fought one against the other, then, make things right between them both. Then, if one of them was insolent against the other, then, fight the one who is insolent until it changed its mind about the command of God. Then, if it changes its mind, make things right between them justly. And act justly. Truly, God loves the ones who act justly","49:10":"Only the ones who believe are brothers/sisters, so make things right between your two brothers/sisters. And be Godfearing of God so that perhaps you will find mercy","49:11":"O those who believed! Let not a folk deride another folk. Perhaps they be better than they, nor women deride other women. Perhaps they be better than they. Nor find fault with one another nor insult one another with nicknames. Miserable was the name of disobedience after belief! And whoever repents not, then, those, they are the ones who are unjust","49:12":"O those who believed! Avoid suspicion much. Truly, some suspicion is a sin. And spy not nor backbite some by some other. Would one of you love to eat the flesh of his lifeless brother? You would have disliked it. And be Godfearing of God.

Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate","49:15":"The ones who believe are not but those who believed in God and His Messenger. Again, they were not in doubt and they struggled with their wealth and themselves in the way of God. Those, they are the ones who are sincere","49:16":"Say: Would you teach God about your way of life while God knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth? And God is Knowing of everything","49:17":"They show grace to thee that they submitted to God. Say: Show you submission to God as grace to me? Nay! God shows grace to you in that He guided you to belief if you, truly, had been ones who are sincere","49:18":"Truly, God knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth. And God is Seeing of what you do","50:1":"Q[f. By the glorious Quran]","50:2":"Nay! They marveled that there drew near them one who warns from among themselves. So the ones who are ungrateful said: This is a strange thing","50:3":"When we died and had been earth dust, that is a far-fetched returning","50:4":"Surely, We knew what the earth reduces from them. And with Us is a guardian Book","50:5":"Nay! They denied The Truth when it drew near them, so they are in a confused state of affairs","50:6":"Look they not on the heaven above them, how We built it and made it appear pleasing? And there are not any gaps in it","50:7":"And the earth, We stretched it out and cast on it firm mountains and caused in it to develop every lovely, diverse pair","50:8":"for contemplation and as a reminder to every servant, one who turns in repentance","50:9":"And We sent down blessed water from heaven.

And He is The Almighty, The Wise","57:2":"To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes to die. And He is Powerful over everything","57:3":"He is The First and The Last, The One Who is Outward and The One Who is Inward.

And those who were ungrateful and denied Our signs, those are the Companions of Hellfire","57:20":"Know that this present life is only a pastime, a diversion and an adornment and a mutual boasting among you and a rivalry in respect to wealth and children as the likeness of plenteous rain water. The plants impressed ones who are ungrateful. Again, it withers; then, thou hast seen it yellowing. Again, it becomes chaff while in the world to come there is severe punishment and forgiveness from God and contentment. And this present life is nothing but a delusion of enjoyment","57:21":"Move quickly towards forgiveness from your Lord and the Garden whose depth is as the breadth of the heavens and earth. It was prepared for those who believed in God and His Messengers. That is the grace of God. He gives it to whom He wills.

We prescribed it not for them but they were so looking for the contentment of God. Then, they gave it not the attention giving its right attention so We gave those who believed among them their compensation. And many of them are ones who disobey","57:28":"O those who believed! Be Godfearing of God and believe in His Messenger. He will give you a double like part of His mercy. And He assigns you a light to walk by. And He will forgive you. And God is Forgiving, Compassionate","57:29":"Certainly, the People of the Book know that they have no power over anything of the grace of God and that the grace of God is in the hand of God.

And for him who is unable to fast, the feeding of sixty needy persons. That is so that you believe in God and His Messenger. And those are the ordinances of God. And for the ones who are ungrateful, a painful punishment","58:5":"Truly, those who oppose God and His Messenger, they were suppressed as those who before them were suppressed. And, surely, We caused clear portents, signs to descend. For the ones who are ungrateful is a despised punishment","58:6":"on a Day when God will raise them up altogether and tell them of what they did. God counted it while they forgot it. And God is a Witness over everything","58:7":"Hast thou not considered that God knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. There will be no conspiring secretly of three, but He is their fourth nor of five, but He is the sixth, nor of fewer than that nor of more, but He is with them wherever they had been. Again, He will tell them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection. Truly, God is Knowing of everything","58:8":"Hast thou not considered those who were prohibited from conspiring secretly? Again, they revert to what they were prohibited from and hold secret counsel in sin and deep-seated dislike and in opposition to the Messenger? And when they drew near thee they gave thee greetings with that with which God gives not as a greeting to thee and they say to themselves: Why punishes us not God for what we say? Hell will be enough for them. They will roast in it. Then, miserable will be the Homecoming","58:9":"O those who believed! When you hold secret counsel, hold not secret counsel in sin and deep-seated dislike and in opposition to the Messenger. But hold secret counsel for virtuous conduct and God-consciousness and be Godfearing of God before Whom you will be assembled","58:10":"Conspiring secretly is only from Satan that he dishearten those who believed.

God will exalt those among you who believed and those who were given the knowledge in degrees. And God is Aware of what you do","58:12":"O those who believed! When you consulted with the Messenger, put charity forward in advance of your conversing privately. That is better for you and purer. But if you find not the means, then, truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate","58:13":"Are you apprehensive to put forward charity in advance of your conversing privately? If, then, you accomplish it not, God turned in forgiveness to you. Perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms and obey God and His Messenger. And God is Aware of what you do","58:14":"Hast thou considered those who turned in friendship to a folk against whom God was angry? They are not of you, nor are you of them and they swear to a lie while they know","58:15":"God prepared a severe punishment for them. Truly, they, how evil is what they had been doing","58:16":"They took their oaths to themselves as a pretext and they barred from the way of God. So for them is a despised punishment","58:17":"Avails them not their wealth and their children against God at all. Those will be the Companions of the Fire. They are ones who will dwell in it forever","58:18":"On a Day when God will raise them up altogether, then, they will swear to Him as they swear to you, assuming that they are something. They, they are ones who lie","58:19":"Satan gained mastery over them, so he caused them to forget the Remembrance of God. Those are of the Party of Satan. Regard the Party of Satan, they will be the ones who are losers","58:20":"Truly, those who oppose God and His Messenger, those are among the humiliated in spirit","58:21":"God prescribed: I will prevail, truly, I and My Messengers. Truly, God is Strong, Almighty","58:22":"Thou wilt not find any folk who believe in God and the Last Day who make friends with whoever opposed God and His Messenger even if they had been their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kinspeople. Those, He prescribed belief in their hearts, and confirmed them with a Spirit from Himself. And He will cause them to enter Gardens beneath which rivers run as ones who will dwell in them forever.

And He is The Almighty, The Wise","59:2":"It is He Who drove out those who were ungrateful—among the People of the Book—from their abodes at the first assembling. You thought that they would not go forth. And they thought that they are ones who are secure in their fortresses from God. But God approached them from where they anticipate not. And He hurled alarm into their hearts. They devastate their own houses with their own hands and the hands of the ones who believe. Then, take warning, O those imbued with insight","59:3":"If God prescribed not banishment for them, He would have punished them in the present.
