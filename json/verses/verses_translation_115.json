They have drawn on themselves wrath upon wrath, and for such disbelievers there is a disgraceful punishment","2:91":"When they are asked to believe in what Allah has revealed, they reply: \"We only believe in what Allah has sent to us (Torah), and we reject what is beside that,\" while it is the truth confirming their own scriptures! Well, ask them, \"If you sincerely believe in what was sent to you , why did you kill the Prophets of Allah who were sent to you from amongst yourselves before","2:92":"Moses came to you with clear Signs, no sooner was he away from you, than you committed evil by worshipping the calf","2:93":"Remember when We took a Covenant from you and We lifted the Mount of Tur over your heads saying: \"Take what We have given you firmly and listen to Our Commandments,\" you replied: \"we have heard but we will not obey.\" So much was the love of that calf in their hearts due to their unbelief.

But the fact is that most of them are faithless","2:101":"Whenever there came to them a Messenger from Allah confirming their own Holy Book, a group from those to whom the Holy book were given cast off the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they knew nothing about it","2:102":"and accepted what the Satans falsely attributed to the kingdom of Solomon; not that Solomon was an unbeliever, it was the Satans who were unbelievers; they taught witchcraft to the people and that which was revealed to the two angels, Harut and Marut in the city of Babylon. Yet, these two angels never taught magic to anyone without saying: \"We have been sent to tempt you; do not renounce your faith.\" In spite of this warning, those people kept on learning from the angels, the magic of which could cause discord between husband and wife; although they could harm none with it except with Allah’s permission. They learned, indeed, what harmed them and did not profit them; even though they knew fully well that the buyers of magic would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. Surely, they sold their souls for a bad price, if they could understand it","2:103":"If they would have believed (accepted Islam) and kept themselves away from evil, there would have been a better reward from Allah, if they could understand it","2:104":"O Believers, do not say to our Messenger: \"Ra'ina\" (an ambiguous word for: \"Listen, may you become deaf\" or \"Our shepherd\" or in Judeo-Arabic language conveys the sense, \"our evil one.\") But say \"Unzurna\" (\"look upon\" us \"or pay attention\" to us) and listen to him carefully; and remember that there is a painful punishment for the unbelievers","2:105":"The unbelievers among the People of the Book, and the pagans, would never wish that any good be sent down to you, O Muhammad, from your Lord, but Allah chooses for His special Mercy whom He pleases, and Allah is the most Gracious","2:106":"We do not abrogate any of Our verses of the Qur'an or cause it to be forgotten except that We substitute it with something better or similar; don't you know that Allah has full power over everything","2:107":"Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and that besides Allah, you have no protector or helper","2:108":"Do you intend to ask questions from your Messenger (Muhammad) as Moses was questioned before?

Allah is Compassionate and Merciful to mankind","2:144":"O Muhammad, many a time We noticed you turning your face towards heaven; now We will make you turn towards a Qiblah that will please you.

If in peacetime anyone wants to take the advantage of performing Umrah and Hajj' together, he should make an offering which he can afford; but if he lack the means, let him fast three days during the Hajj and seven days on his return making ten days in all.

Later when people invented other religions, Allah appointed Prophets as bearers of good news and warnings; and revealed to them the Book with the True Guidance to settle the matters of dispute between mankind.

In such cases their husbands have a right to take them back in that period if they desire reconciliation. Women have rights similar to those exercised against them in an equitable manner, although men have a status (degree of responsibility) above them. Allah is Mighty, Wise","2:229":"The pronouncement of revocable divorce is only allowed twice: then she should be allowed to stay with honor or let go with kindness after the third pronouncement.

The reasonable cost of their maintenance and clothing will be the responsibility of the child’s father. No one should be charged with more than they can afford. Neither a mother should be made to suffer on account of her child nor a father on account of his child. The father’s heirs are under the same obligation. But if, with mutual agreement, they both decide to wean the child, there is no blame on them. If you decide to have a foster-mother for your offspring, there is no blame on you provided you pay what you have promised to pay in an honorable manner. Fear Allah and beware that Allah observes your actions","2:234":"As for those of you who die and leave widows behind, let them abstain from marriage for four months and ten days: when they have reached the end of this period, there is no blame on you for what they do for themselves in a decent manner. Allah is aware of what you do","2:235":"There is no blame on you if you make a proposal of marriage during their waiting period openly or keep it in your hearts. Allah knows that you will naturally cherish them in your hearts; however, be careful not to make any secret agreement, and if you wish to marry, speak to them in an honorable manner.

Bear in mind that Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing","2:236":"There is no blame on you if you divorce women before the marriage is consummated or the dowry is settled. Pay them something anyhow, the rich man according to his means and poor according to his, a reasonable amount in all fairness. This is an obligation on the righteous people","2:237":"And if you divorce them before the marriage is consummated but after the fixation of a dowry, give them half of their dowry unless the woman wants to waive it or the man in whose hand is the marriage tie agrees to forego (and pay the dowry in full). To forego and give full dowry is closer to piety. Do not forget to show kindness to each other.

Allah alone can decrease and increase wealth, and to Him you all shall return","2:246":"Have you not reflected on what the leaders of the children of Israel demanded from one of their Prophets after the death of Moses? \"Appoint for us a king,\" they said, \"and we will fight in the cause of Allah.\" The Prophet replied: \"What if you refuse to fight when you are ordered to do so?\" They replied, \"How could we refuse to fight in the cause of Allah, while we along with our children were driven out of our homes?\" But when, on their demand, they were ordered to fight, all refused except a few of them. Allah knows the evildoers","2:247":"Their Prophet told them: \"Allah has appointed TaLut to be your king.\" They replied: \"How can he be our king when some of us are more deserving than him? Besides, he is not rich.\" The Prophet said: \"Allah has chosen him to rule over you and blessed him with knowledge and stature. Allah grants kingship to whom He pleases and Allah has boundless knowledge","2:248":"Furthermore, their Prophet told them: \"The sign of his appointment as a king is that there will come to you the chest in which there is tranquillity from your Lord and the residue of relics which the family of Moses and the family of Haroon (Aaron) left behind, and that chest will be carried by the angels. Surely therein is a sign for you if you are true believers","2:249":"When TaLut marched forth with his army, he announced: \"Allah will test you at a certain river; anyone who will drink from its water shall cease to be my soldier, and those who will not drink to quench their thirst with its water except a sip or so from the hollow of their hands shall fight on my side.\" They all drank from it, inspite of this warning, except a few of them. When he and those who believed with him crossed the river, they said: \"We have no power left this day against JaLut (Goliath) and his warriors.\" But the believers, who knew they would meet Allah, replied: \"It has often happened that a small group, by the grace of Allah, has vanquished a mighty army. Allah is with those who endure with patience","2:250":"When they advanced to face JaLut (Goliath) and his warriors, they prayed: \"Our Lord! Fill our hearts with steadfastness, make our steps firm, and help us (give us victory) against the unbelievers","2:251":"By Allah’s will they put the unbelievers to flight, and Davidkilled JaLut. Allah gave David the kingdom and wisdom and taught him what else He pleased.

Surely you, O Muhammad, are one of Our Messengers","2:253":"These are the Messengers (which We have sent for the guidance of mankind). We have exalted some above others. To some Allah spoke directly; others He raised high in ranks; to Jesus the son of Mary We gave clear Signs and supported him with the Holy Spirit. If Allah wanted, the people who received the clear signs would not have fought against each other; but they disputed as a result, there were some who believed while others rejected. Yet If Allah wanted, they would not have fought each other; but Allah does what He intends","2:254":"O believers! Spend out of the sustenance which We have provided for you before the arrival of that Day when there will be no bargaining, friendship or intercession. It is the unbelievers who are wrongdoers","2:255":"Allah! There is no god but Him: the Living, the Eternal. He neither slumbers nor sleeps. To Him belongs all that is in the Heavens and the Earth. Who can intercede with Him without His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them. They cannot gain access to any thing out of His knowledge except what He pleases. His throne is more vast than the heavens and the earth, and guarding of these both does not fatigue Him. He is the Exalted, the Supreme","2:256":"There is no compulsion in religion. True guidance has been made clearly distinct from error. Therefore, whoever renounces ‘Taghut’ (forces of Satan) and believes in Allah has grasped the firm hand-hold that will never break. Allah, Whose hand-hold you have grasped, hears all and knows all","2:257":"Allah is the Wali (Protector) of those who believe, He brings them out of the depth of darkness and leads them into the light.

As a result they will become the companions of the Hell fire and shall live therein forever","2:258":"Have you ever reflected upon the one, to whom Allah had given a kingdom, who argued with Abraham about his Lord. When Abraham said: \"My Lord is He Who has power to give life and to cause death.\" He replied: \"I too have the power to give life and to cause death.\" Abraham said: \"Well, Allah causes the sun to rise from the east; just make it rise from the west.\" Thus the unbeliever was confounded; Allah does not guide the evildoers","2:259":"Or take another example of the one (Prophet Ezra) who passed by a town which had fallen down upon its roofs. He exclaimed: \"How can Allah bring this dead township back to life?\" Thereupon Allah caused him to die, and after one hundred years brought him back to life. Allah asked: \"How long did you remain here?\" Ezra replied: \"Perhaps a day or part of a day.\" Allah said: \"Nay! You have remained here for one hundred years: now just have a look at your food and drink; they are not rotten; and then look at your donkey and see that his very bones have decayed. We have done this to make you a Sign for mankind. Look at the bones of your donkey how We bring them together then clothe them with flesh and bring him back to life!

Allah is Self-sufficient, Forbearing","2:264":"O believers! Do not make your charity worthless by reminders of your generosity or by injury to the recipients feelings, like those who spend their wealth to be seen by people and believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. Their parable is like a hard barren rock covered with a thin layer of soil; a heavy rain falls, leaving it just a bare stone. Such people will not gain any reward that they thought they had earned. Allah does not guide the unbelievers","2:265":"The example of those who spend their wealth to seek the pleasure of Allah and to strengthen their souls is like a garden on a high and fertile ground: when heavy rain falls on it, it yields up twice its normal produce; and if no rain falls, even a light moisture is sufficient. Whatever you do is in the sight of Allah","2:266":"Would any one of you like that his garden, which is full of palm trees, grape vines, and all kinds of fruits and watered by running streams, be blasted and consumed by a fiery whirlwind at the time when he has become too old and his children are too feeble to earn anything?

Those who turn back (repeat this crime), they shall be the inmates of hellfire wherein they will live forever","2:276":"Allah has laid His curse on usury and blessed charity to prosper. Allah does not love any ungrateful sinner","2:277":"Those who believe and do good deeds, establish regular prayers, and give regular charity will have their reward with their Lord. They will have nothing to fear or to regret","2:278":"O You who believe! Fear Allah and waive what is still due to you from usury if you are indeed believers","2:279":"or war shall be declared against you by Allah and His Messenger. If you repent, you may retain your principal, causing no loss to debtor and suffering no loss","2:280":"If the debtor is in a difficulty, grant him time till it is easy for him to repay; but if you waive the sum by way of charity it will be better for you, if you understand it","2:281":"Fear the Day when you shall all return to Allah; when every one shall be paid in full what they have earned and none shall be dealt with unjustly","2:282":"O believers! When you deal with each other in lending for a fixed period of time, put it in writing. Let a scribe write it down with justice between the parties. The scribe, who is given the gift of literacy by Allah, should not refuse to write; he is under obligation to write. Let him who incurs the liability (debtor) dictate, fearing Allah his Lord and not diminishing anything from the settlement. If the borrower is mentally unsound or weak or is unable to dictate himself, let the guardian of his interests dictate for him with justice. Let two witnesses from among you bear witness to all such documents, if two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice should bear witness, so that if one of the women forgets anything the other may remind her. The witnesses must not refuse when they are called upon to do so. You must not be averse to writing (your contract) for a future period, whether it is a small matter or big. This action is more just for you in the sight of Allah, because it facilitates the establishment of evidence and is the best way to remove all doubts; but if it is a common commercial transaction concluded on the spot among yourselves, there is no blame on you if you do not put it in writing. You should have witnesses when you make commercial transactions. Let no harm be done to the scribe or witnesses; and if you do so, you shall be guilty of transgression. Fear Allah; it is Allah that teaches you and Allah has knowledge of everything","2:283":"If you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe to write down the transaction, then transact your business by taking possession of a pledge. If one of you entrust another with a pledge, let the trustee deliver the pledged property to its owner, and let him fear Allah, his Lord. Do not conceal testimony, and whoever conceals it, his heart is surely sinful. Allah is aware of all your actions","2:284":"To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth. Whether you reveal what is in your minds or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it. He, however, has full authority to pardon or punish anyone He pleases. Allah has complete power over everything","2:285":"The Messenger believes in the Guidance revealed to him from his Lord and so do the Believers. They all believe in Allah, His angels, His books and His Messengers. They say: \"We do not discriminate against anyone of His Messengers.\" And they say: \"We hear and we obey. Grant us Your forgiveness, O Lord; to You we shall all return","2:286":"Allah does not burden any human being with more than he can bear. Everyone will enjoy the credit of his deeds and suffer the debits of his evil-doings. The believers say: \"Our Lord! Do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord! Do not place on us a burden as You placed on those before us. Our Lord! Lay not on us the kind of burden that we have no strength to bear. Pardon us, Forgive us, Have mercy on us. You are our Protector, help us against the unbelievers","3:1":"Alif L'am M'im","3:2":"Allah! There is no god but Him; the Living, the Eternal","3:3":"He has revealed to you this Book with the Truth, confirming the scripture which preceded it, as He revealed the Torah and Gospel","3:4":"before this, as a guidance for mankind and also revealed this Al-Furqan (criterion for judgment between right and wrong). Surely those who reject Allah’s revelations will be sternly punished; Allah is Mighty, capable of retribution","3:5":"For sure nothing in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah","3:6":"It is He Who shapes your bodies in the wombs of your mothers as He pleases. There is no god but Him; the Mighty, the Wise","3:7":"He is the One Who has revealed to you the Book. Some of its verses are decisive they are the foundation of the Book - while others are allegorical. Those whose hearts are infected with disbelief follow the allegorical part to mislead others and to give it their own interpretation, seeking for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allah. Those who are well grounded in knowledge say: \"We believe in it; it is all from our Lord.\" None will take heed except the people of understanding","3:8":"They say: \"Our Lord, do not let our hearts deviate from the truth after you have guided us, and grant us Your own mercy; You are the Grantor of bounties without measure","3:9":"Our Lord, You will surely gather all mankind before You on the Day about which there is no doubt; surely Allah does not break His promise","3:10":"Surely neither their wealth nor their children will save the unbelievers from the wrath of Allah: they are the ones who will become the fuel for hellfire","3:11":"Their end will be the same as that of the people of Pharaoh and their predecessors who denied Our revelations, so Allah called them to account for their sins. Allah is strict in retribution","3:12":"O Muhammad, say to the unbelievers: \"Soon you will be overpowered and driven together to Hell - which is a horrible refuge","3:13":"Indeed there was a sign (lesson) for you in the two armies which met on the battlefield (of Badr): one was fighting for the cause of Allah and the other had rejected Allah; the believers saw with their own eyes that the unbelievers were twice their number. But the result of the battle proved that Allah strengthens with His own aid whom He pleases. Surely there is a lesson in this for those who have sight","3:14":"The life of men is tempted by love and desire for women, children, the hoarding of treasures of gold and silver, branded horses, wealth of cattle and plantations. These are the comforts for the transitory life of this world; the everlasting best comfort, however, is with Allah","3:15":"Say : \"Shall I tell you of better things than these, with which the righteous will be rewarded by their Lord? There will be gardens beneath which rivers flow, where they will live forever with spouses of perfect chastity and the good pleasure of Allah. Allah is watching His servants very closely","3:16":"The righteous people are those who pray: \"Our Lord! We sincerely believe in You: please forgive our sins and save us from the agony of the hellfire","3:17":"who are steadfast, sincere, obedient, and charitable, and who pray for forgiveness in the morning time","3:18":"Allah Himself has testified to the fact that there is no god but Him and so do the angels and those who are well grounded in knowledge standing firm on justice. There is no Ilah (God) except Him, the Mighty, the Wise","3:19":"Surely the only Deen (true religion and the Right Way of life) in the sight of Allah is Al-Islam. Those to whom the Book was given did not adopt ways different than this except out of envy among themselves, and after true knowledge had come to them. They should know that Allah is swift in calling to account those who deny His revelations","3:20":"So if they argue with you (O Muhammad), tell them: \"I have submitted myself entirely to Allah and so have those who follow me.\" Then ask those who are given the Book and those who are illiterate: \"Will you also submit yourselves to Allah?\" If they become Muslims they shall be rightly guided but if they turn back, you need not worry, because your sole responsibility is to convey the Message. Allah is watching all His servants very closely","3:21":"Give a warning to those who deny Allah’s revelations, who slay the Prophets without any justification, and who kill those from among the people who enjoin justice, that there is a painful punishment for them","3:22":"They are the ones whose deeds will become void in this world and in the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers","3:23":"Have you not seen the behavior of those (Jews) who have been given a portion of the Book? When they are invited to settle their disputes according to the Book of Allah, some of them turn back and decline","3:24":"This is because they say: \"The fire of Hell shall not touch us; even if it does, it will be for a few days.\" In their religion they are deceived by their own self-invented beliefs","3:25":"What will they do when We will gather them together on the Day which is sure to come, when every soul will be given what it has earned and there shall be no injustice","3:26":"Say: \"O Allah! Master of all the Kingship, You give the kingdom to whom You please and take away the kingdom from whomsoever You please; You give honor to whom You please and disgrace whom You please; all the good is in Your hand; surely You have power over everything","3:27":"You cause the night to pass into the day and You cause the day to pass into the night; You draw the living from the dead and You draw the dead from the living; and You provide sustenance for anyone You wish without measure","3:28":"Let not the believers make unbelievers their protectors rather than the believers; anyone who does so will have nothing to hope for from Allah - except if you do so as a precaution to guard yourselves against their tyranny. Anyhow, Allah warns you to fear Him: because with Allah is your final refuge","3:29":"Say: \"Whether you conceal what is in your heart or reveal it, it is known to Allah","3:30":"He knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Allah has full power over everything. On the Day of Judgment, when every soul will be confronted with whatever good it has done - as for its evil deeds, it will wish they were a long way off. Allah cautions you to beware of Him. Allah is full of kindness towards His devotees","3:31":"Tell the people O Muhammad: \"If you sincerely love Allah, then follow me; Allah will also love you and forgive you your sins. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","3:32":"Also tell them, \"Obey Allah and His Messenger.\" Inspite of this, if they turn back, then warn them, that Allah does not love the disbelievers","3:33":"Indeed Allah exalted Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham and the family of Imran above all the worlds","3:34":"They were the offsprings of one another. Allah hears all and knows all","3:35":"Allah heard when the wife of `Imran said, \"O my Lord! I dedicate to Your service what is in my womb. Please accept it from me. You Alone hear all and know all","3:36":"When she gave birth to a girl instead of a boy, she said: \"My Lord! I have given birth to a girl,\" - Allah knew very well what she had delivered - \"and that the male is not like the female, I have named her Mary and I seek Your protection for her and her children from the mischief of Satan, the accursed","3:37":"Her Lord graciously accepted that girl. He made her grow up as a good girl and entrusted her to the care of Zakariya. Whenever Zakariya entered the sanctuary to see her, he found with her food. He asked, \"O Mary! From where did you get it?\" She replied, \"It came from Allah. In fact, Allah gives to whom He wants without measure","3:38":"Thereupon Zakariya prayed to his Lord saying: \"O my Lord! Grant me a righteous child as Your special favor; surely You hear all prayers","3:39":"As he stood praying in the Mahrab (a prayer place in the sanctuary) the angels called out to him saying: \"Allah gives you good news of a son to be named John, he will confirm the word of Allah, he will be a great leader, chaste and a Prophet from among the righteous","3:40":"He said: \"O my Lord! How can I have a son now that I have reached an old age and my wife is barren?\" \"Such is the will of Allah\" he replied, \" Allah does what He wants","3:41":"Zakariya said: \"My Lord! Grant me a sign.\" It was said: \"Your sign is that you will not be able to speak to people for three days except through gestures. During this time you should remember your Lord very much and glorify Him in the evening and in the morning","3:42":"There came the time when angels said: \"O Mary! Surely Allah has exalted you, purified you, and preferred you for His service over all the women of the worlds","3:43":"O Mary! Be obedient to your Lord, prostrate and bow down in worship with other worshippers","3:44":"O Muhammad, this is the news from the Unseen which We are revealing to you. You were not present with them when priests of the temple cast their pens to decide which of them should be the guardian of Mary; nor were you with them when they argued about it","3:45":"When the angels said \"O Mary! Allah gives you the good news with a Word from Him that you will be given a son: his name will be Messiah, Jesus (Jesus Christ) the son of Mary. He will be noble in this world and the Hereafter; and he will be from those who are very close to Allah","3:46":"He will speak to the people in the cradle and in his old age and he will be among the righteous","3:47":"Hearing this, Mary said, \"O my Lord! How can I have a son when no man has ever touched me?\" He replied, \"Even so, Allah creates however He wants; whenever He decides to do anything, He only says to it, 'Be,' and it is","3:48":"Allah will teach your son the Book, the Wisdom, the Torah, and the Gospel","3:49":"and send him forth as a Messenger to the Children of Israel with this message: 'I have brought you signs of my appointment from your Lord. I will make for you the likeness of a bird from clay; I will breathe into it and, with Allah’s leave, it will become a living bird. I will heal the blind and the lepers, and raise the dead to life, by Allah's leave. Furthermore, I will tell you what you have eaten and what you have stored in your houses. Surely these are the signs to convince you if you are believers","3:50":"I am appointed to confirm that which is before me from the Torah and to make lawful to you some of the things forbidden to you. Now I have brought you the signs from your Lord, therefore fear Allah and obey me","3:51":"In fact, Allah is my Lord as well as your Lord, therefore, worship Him; this is the Right Way","3:52":"When Jesus found out that they (most of the children of Israel) had no faith, he asked: \"Who will help me in the cause of Allah?\" The Disciples replied: \"We will help you in the cause of Allah. We believe in Allah. Be our witness that we are Muslims","3:53":"(Then they invoked Allah and said): \"Our Lord! We believe in what you have revealed and we follow Your Messenger. Please count us with those who bear witness","3:54":"The unbelievers among the children of Israel plotted against Jesus and Allah also devised a plan to raise him up, and Allah is the best in planning","3:55":"Allah said: \"O Jesus! I am going to recall you (from your mission) and raise you up to Myself. I will clean you of those who rejected you and exalt your followers above the unbelievers until the Day of Resurrection; then to Me shall be your return and I shall judge those matters in which you have been disputing","3:56":"Those who are unbelievers will be punished with severe punishment in this world and the Hereafter; they shall have no helpers","3:57":"As for those who believe and do good deeds, Allah will pay them their full reward. Allah does not love the transgressors","3:58":"This revelation which We recite to you is full of signs and wise reminders","3:59":"In fact, the example of the birth of Jesus ( Jesus) in the sight of Allah is like the example of Adam who had no father and mother, whom He created out of dust, then said to him: \"Be\" and he was","3:60":"This is the Truth from your Lord, therefore, do not be of those who doubt it","3:61":"If anyone disputes with you concerning this matter (the birth of Jesus) after full knowledge has come to you, say: \"Come! Let us gather our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves: then let us earnestly pray and invoke the curse of Allah on the liars","3:62":"Verily this is the absolute true explanation. The fact of the matter is, that there is no god but Allah; and for sure Allah is the Mighty, the Wise","3:63":"But if they turn away from accepting this challenge, it will be clear proof of their mischief and Allah has full knowledge of mischief-mongers","3:64":"Say: \"O people of the Book! Let us get together on what is common between us and you: that we shall worship none but Allah; that we shall not associate any partners with Him; that we shall not take from among ourselves any lords beside Allah.\" If they reject your invitation then tell them: \"Bear witness that we are Muslims (who have surrendered to Allah)","3:65":"O people of the Book! Why do you argue with us about Abraham, as to whether he was a Jew or a Christian? You know that the Torah and the Gospel were revealed long after him? Have you no sense at all","3:66":"So far you have been arguing about things of which you had some knowledge! Must you now argue about that of which you know nothing at all? Allah knows while you do not","3:67":"Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian but he was a Muslim, true in faith. He was not one of the Pagans (who set up partners with Allah)","3:68":"Surely the people nearest to Abraham are those who follow him, which are this Prophet (Muhammad) and those who believe with him; Allah is the Protector of only those who are the believers","3:69":"Some of the People of the Book want to mislead you; but they mislead none except themselves, though they do not realize it","3:70":"O People of the Book! Why do you deny the revelations of Allah when you know that they are true","3:71":"O People of the Book! Why do you confound the truth with falsehood and knowingly conceal the truth","3:72":"Some of the People of the Book say to one another: \"Believe in what is revealed to the believers (Muslims) in the morning and deny it in the evening; so that they (the Muslims) may follow suit and abandon their faith","3:73":"Do not follow anyone except the one who follows your own religion.\" O Muhammad, tell them: \"The only true guidance is the guidance of Allah.\" These people of the Book do not believe that revelation could be sent to anyone besides themselves, like that which has been sent to you; or that they will ever argue with you in the presence of your Lord. Tell them: \"For sure, grace is in the hands of Allah: He bestows it on whom He pleases; Allah has boundless knowledge","3:74":"He chooses for His mercy whom He pleases, Allah is the Owner of mighty grace","3:75":"Among the People of the Book there are some who, if you trust them with a heap of gold, will readily return it back; and there are others who, if you trust them with a single dinar (silver coin) will not return it back unless you constantly keep on demanding; because they say, \"We are not going to be called to account for our behavior with the illiterates (non Jews or Christians).\" Thus they deliberately ascribe a lie to Allah -knowing well that He never permitted such wrongdoing","3:76":"In fact, those who keep their promise and guard themselves against evil are His beloved, for Allah loves only those who guard themselves against such evils","3:77":"In fact, those who sell the covenants of Allah and their own oaths for a petty price, shall have no portion in the hereafter. Allah will neither speak to them nor even look at them nor cleanse them from their sins on the Day of Judgment. They shall have painful punishment","3:78":"There are some among them who twist their tongues pretending a quote from their Holy Book; so that you may think that what they read is a part of the Book, whereas, in fact it is not a part of the Book. They also assert, \"It is from Allah\" whereas, in fact it is not from Allah. Thus they deliberately ascribe a lie to Allah","3:79":"It is not possible for a man whom Allah has given the Book, the Wisdom and the Prophethood, that he would say to the people: \"Worship me instead of Allah.\" On the contrary he would say: \"Be devoted worshippers of your Lord in accordance with the Holy Book you have been teaching and reading","3:80":"He would never ask you to take angels and prophets as your lords. Would he ask you to become kafir (unbeliever) after you have become Muslim (believer)","3:81":"Allah took a covenant with the Prophets, saying: \"Now that you have been given the Book and Wisdom; there will come to you a Messenger who will confirm that which is with you, you will have to believe in him and help him in his mission.\" Then He said \"Do you affirm this covenant and agree to take this heavy responsibility?\" The Prophets replied, \"Yes, we do affirm.\" Allah said, \"Very well, bear witness to this and I too bear witness with you","3:82":"Now if anyone turns back after this, he will become the transgressor","3:83":"Are they looking for a religion other than the Deen (religion and Way of Life) of Allah knowing well that everything in the heavens and in the earth, willingly or unwillingly, has submitted to Him? And to Him they shall all return","3:84":"O Prophet, say: \"We believe in Allah and what is revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and their descendants; and in that which was given to Moses, Jesus and other Prophets from their Lord; we do not discriminate between any one of them, and to Allah do we submit in Islam","3:85":"If anyone is looking for a religion other than Islam, then let it be known that it will not be accepted from him; and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers","3:86":"How can it be that Allah would guide those people who commit Kufr (reject faith) after their Iman (acceptance of faith), acknowledge that the Messenger is true, and clear proofs have come to them? Allah does not guide such wrongdoers","3:87":"The reward of such people is that upon them is the curse of Allah, the angels and all mankind","3:88":"They shall remain under it forever; neither will their punishment be lightened nor will they be given respite","3:89":"However, those who repent after this and mend their ways, verily Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","3:90":"However, those who disbelieve after their belief (acceptance of Islam) then go on adding to their disbelief, their repentance will never be accepted; because they intentionally chose to go astray","3:91":"As to those who are unbelievers and die while they were unbelievers, if they were to fill the whole earth with gold and offer it as a ransom for each one of them, that would not be accepted.

They say (to themselves): \"If we had had anything to do with this affair, We should not have been in the slaughter here.\" Say: \"Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death\"; but (all this was) that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts.

If the deceased left children behind, each of the parents shall get one sixth of the estate, but if the deceased left no children and the parents are the only heirs, the mother shall get one third of the estate, but if the deceased left brothers and sisters, then the mother will get one sixth of it.

It is not lawful for you consider women as a part of your inheritance and retain them against their will in order that you may force them to give up a part of the dowry you have given them, unless they are guilty of proven fornication.

This is the order of Allah relating to marriage prohibitions. All women other than these are lawful provided you seek them in marriage with gifts from your property (dowry), desiring chastity and not lust. Give them their dowry as an obligation for the benefit you have received from your marriage relationship. However, there is no blame on you if you change the agreement of dowry with mutual consent. Allah is the Knowledgeable, Wise","4:25":"If any of you cannot afford to marry a free believing woman, let him marry one of his own slave girls who is a believer; Allah knows how good you are in your faith. You all belong to one and the same community. Marry them with the permission of their family and give them their fair dowry so that they may live a decent life in wedlock and not live as prostitutes or look for secret illicit relationships. Then if after marriage they commit adultery, they shall be given half the punishment prescribed for a free adulteress. The concession of such a marriage is for those of you who fear that they might commit a sin if they do not get married, but it is better for you to practice self- restraint. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","4:26":"Allah desires to clarify, and guides you to the ways which were followed by the righteous people before you, and turns to you in mercy.

As for those with whom you have made firm agreements, give them their share. Surely Allah is a Witness to everything","4:34":"Men are overseers over women because Allah has given the one more strength than the other, and because men are required to spend their wealth for the maintenance of women. Honorable women are, therefore, devoutly obedient and guard in the husband’s absence what Allah requires them to guard their husband’s property and their own honor. As to those women from whom you fear disobedience, first admonish them, then refuse to share your bed with them, and then, if necessary, beat them. Then if they obey you, take no further actions against them and do not make excuses to punish them. Allah is Supremely Great and is aware of your actions","4:35":"If you fear a breach of marriage between a man and his wife, appoint one arbiter from his family and another from hers; if they wish to reconcile, Allah will create a way of reconciliation between them.

This is because one who commits shirk with Allah, does indeed invent a great sinful lie","4:49":"Have you not seen those who speak very highly of their own purity even though they are committing shirk. In fact, Allah purifies whom He wishes. If the pagans are not purified, no injustice - even equal to the thread of a date-stone - is being done to them","4:50":"See how they invent a lie against Allah, and this in itself is enough to show their manifest sin","4:51":"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Book?

As for those who pay no heed, they should know that We have not sent you as a taskmaster over them","4:81":"They will say: \"We are at your service!\" Yet when they leave you, some of them meet together secretly at night to plot against what you have said. Allah notes down all their plots. Therefore, leave them alone and put your trust in Allah. Allah is your all sufficient trustee","4:82":"Why don’t they research the Qur’an? Don’t they realize that if it was from someone other than Allah, they would find many discrepancies in it","4:83":"Whenever they hear news of peace or of danger, they spread it quickly; but if they would report it to the Messenger and to the responsible people in the community, it would come to the knowledge of those who could draw the right conclusions. If it had not been for Allah’s grace and mercy, all of you with the exception of a few, would have followed Satan","4:84":"Therefore, O Muhammad, fight in the path of Allah, you are accountable for no one except for yourself. Urge the believers to fight, it may be that Allah will overthrow the might of the unbelievers, for Allah is the strongest in might and severe in punishment","4:85":"Anyone who intercedes for a good cause shall have a share in it, and anyone who intercedes for an evil cause shall also get a share in its burden.

Allah keeps account of everything","4:87":"Allah! There is no god besides Him. He will certainly gather you all together on the Day of Resurrection; there is no doubt in it, and who can be more truthful in his words than Allah","4:88":"What is the matter with you, why are you divided into two groups concerning the hypocrites, while Allah has cast them off on account of their misdeeds? Do you wish to guide those whom Allah has confounded? Whomever Allah has confounded you cannot find a way for them to be guided","4:89":"Their real wish is to see that you become a disbeliever, as they themselves have disbelieved, so that you may become exactly like them. So you should not take friends from their ranks unless they immigrate in the way of Allah; and if they do not, seize them and kill them wherever you find them, and do not take any of them as protectors or helpers","4:90":"The exception to this is for those who take refuge with your allies or come over to you because their hearts restrain them both from fighting against you and from fighting against their own people. If Allah had wanted, He would have given them power over you and they might easily have fought against you; therefore, if they withdraw from you and cease their hostility and offer you peace, in that case Allah has not granted you permission to fight against them","4:91":"You will find other hypocrites who wish to be safe from you as well as from their own people; but who would plunge into mischief whenever they get an opportunity. Therefore if they do not keep distance from you and neither offer you peace, nor cease their hostilities against you, you may seize them and kill them wherever you find them, against such people We give you absolute authority","4:92":"It is not befitting for a believer to kill a believer except by accident, and whoever accidently kills a believer, he is commanded to free a believing slave and pay bloodwit to the family of the victim, unless they forgo it as a charity. If the victim is from a hostile nation, then the freeing of a believing slave is enough, but if he belonged to a nation with whom you have a treaty, then bloodwit must be paid to his family along with the freeing of a believing slave. Those who do not have the means (bloodwit and / or a slave) must fast two consecutive months: a method of repentance provided by Allah. Allah is the Knowledgeable, Wise","4:93":"Whoever kills a believer intentionally, his punishment is hell to live therein forever. He shall incur the wrath of Allah, Who will lay His curse on him and prepare for him a woeful punishment","4:94":"O believers! When you struggle in the way of Allah, investigate carefully, and do not say to anyone who offers you a saLutation: \"You are not a believer\" in order to seek worldly gain by this. Allah has abundant spoils for you. Remember that you yourselves were in the same condition before. Allah has conferred His favors on you. Therefore, make a thorough investigation before considering someone an unbeliever. Allah is well aware of all your actions","4:95":"Those believers who stay at home - having no physical disability - are not equal to those who make Jihad (struggle) in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their persons. Allah has granted a higher rank to those who make Jihad with their wealth and their persons than to those who stay at home. Though Allah has promised a good reward for all, Allah has prepared a much richer reward for those who make Jihad for Him than for those who stay at home","4:96":"they have special higher ranks, forgiveness and mercy. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","4:97":"When the angels of death cause those people to die who have wronged their souls, they ask: \"What was your condition?\" They reply: \"We were oppressed in the earth.\" The angels say: \"Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to emigrate and go somewhere else?\" Hell will be their abode and it is a very evil refuge","4:98":"However, those helpless men, women and children who have neither the means to migrate nor strength to escape","4:99":"Allah may pardon them. Allah is the Pardoning, Forgiving","4:100":"He who emigrates in the path of Allah shall find numerous places of refuge in the Earth and abundant resources. He who leaves his home to migrate for Allah and His Messenger and dies on the way, his reward becomes due and sure with Allah. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","4:101":"When you travel in the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, especially when you fear that the unbelievers may attack you, since the unbelievers are your open enemies","4:102":"When you, O Muhammad, are with them, leading their Salah (prayer in the state of war), let one party of them stand up to pray with you, armed with their weapons. After they finish their prostrations, let them withdraw to the rear and let the other party who have not yet prayed come forward to pray with you; and let them also be on their guard, armed with their weapons. The unbelievers wish to see you neglect your arms and your baggage, so that they could suddenly attack to overpower you all in one stroke. However, there is no blame on you if you lay aside your arms because of heavy rain or because you are sick, but you should still be on your guard. Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for the unbelievers","4:103":"When you finish your Salah (prayers) remember Allah whether you are standing, sitting or reclining; then as soon as you are safe (out of danger) establish regular Salah in full. Surely Salah are made obligatory for the believers at their prescribed times","4:104":"Do not show weakness in following up the enemy; if you are suffering hardships they too are suffering similar hardships; moreover, you have hope to receive reward from Allah while they have none. Allah is the Knowledgeable, Wise","4:105":"We have revealed to you the Book with the Truth so that you may judge between people in accordance with the Right Way which Allah has shown you, so be not an advocate for those who betray trust","4:106":"seek Allah’s forgiveness, surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","4:107":"Do not plead on behalf of those who betray their own souls; Allah does not love the treacherous, sinful","4:108":"They might be able to hide their crimes from people, but they cannot hide from Allah. He is with them even when they plot by night in words that He cannot approve. Allah encompasses all their actions","4:109":"You may plead for them in this life, but who will plead for them with Allah on the Day of Resurrection? Or who will be their defender","4:110":"If anyone does evil or wrongs his own soul and then seeks Allah’s forgiveness, he will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful","4:111":"Whoever commits a sin, he commits it against his own soul. Allah is knowledgeable, Wise","4:112":"But if anyone commits a crime and charges an innocent person with it (a Muslim from the tribe of Bani Dhafar committed theft and put the blame on a Jew who was innocent), he indeed shall bear the guilt of slander and a flagrant sin","4:113":"If Allah’s grace and mercy were not with you to save you from their mischief, a group of them (tribe of Bani Dhafar) was determined to lead you astray. They led astray none but themselves, and they cannot do you any harm. Allah has revealed to you the Book and wisdom and taught you what you did not know; great indeed is the grace of Allah upon you","4:114":"There is no virtue in most of the secret counsels of the people; it is, however, good if one secretly enjoins charity, kindness, and reconciliation among people; the one who does this to please Allah, will soon be given a mighty reward","4:115":"Anyone who is hostile to the Messenger after guidance has been plainly conveyed to him and follows a path other than that of the believers, We shall leave him in the path he has chosen and cast him into Hell, which is an evil refuge","4:116":"Surely Allah will never forgive the one who commits the sin of shirk and may forgive anyone else if He so pleases. One who commits shirk has indeed gone far away from the Right Way","4:117":"The pagans call upon female deities beside Him; by doing so they call nothing but the rebellious Satan","4:118":"on whom Allah has laid His curse; and who has said: \"I will take a good portion of Your servants and mislead them","4:119":"I will create in them false desires and order them to slit the ears of cattle. I will order them to tamper with Allah’s creation.\" Therefore, whoever takes Satan as a guardian instead of Allah, has indeed become a clear-cut loser","4:120":"Satan makes promises to stir up in them false desires; but Satan makes them promises only to deceive them","4:121":"The home of such people who follow him will be hell, from where they will find no way to escape","4:122":"As for those who have faith and do righteous deeds, We shall soon admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow to live therein forever.

He who does evil will be requited with evil: he will find no protector or helper besides Allah","4:124":"But the one who does righteous deeds, whether a male or a female - provided he or she is a believer - shall enter paradise and will not be harmed a speck","4:125":"Who has a better Deen (way of life or religion) than the one who is a Muslim (submits himself entirely) to Allah, does good to others and follows the faith of Abraham the upright one, whom Allah chose to be His friend","4:126":"To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth. Allah encompasses everything","4:127":"They ask your decision concerning the women. Tell them: Allah makes His decision concerning them and along with it reminds you about those commandments, recited to you in the Book (The Qur'an), relating to orphan girls to whom you do not give their lawful rights and to whom you do not wish to marry. He also reminds you regarding the helpless children, and to stand firm for justice to orphans. Whatever good you do, Allah surely knows it","4:128":"If a woman fears cruelty or desertion from her husband, there is no blame if both of them agree to reconcile by means of a compromise, after all compromise is better. Human souls are prone to narrow- mindedness, but if you show generosity and fear Allah in your dealings, surely Allah is well aware of your actions","4:129":"It is not possible for you to do justice between your wives even if you wish to do so; therefore, in order to comply with Divine Law, do not lean towards one wife to the extent that you leave the other hanging in air.

We directed the People of the Book before you and now direct you also, to fear Allah in your dealings with one another. But if you disobey ( you will do so at your own risk) for Allah owns all that is in the Heavens and in the Earth and Allah is Self-sufficient, Praiseworthy","4:132":"Yes!

Allah hears all and sees all","4:135":"O believers! Stand firm for justice and bear true witness for the sake of Allah, even though it be against yourselves, your parents or your relatives.

If you distort your testimony or decline to give it, then you should remember that Allah is fully aware of your actions","4:136":"O believers! Believe in Allah, His Messenger, the Book which He has revealed to His Messenger, and every Book which He previously revealed. He who denies Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Last Day has gone far astray","4:137":"As for those who accept the faith then renounce it, who again embrace it and again deny it, and go on increasing in unbelief, Allah will neither forgive them nor guide them to the Right Way","4:138":"Announce the painful punishment to those hypocrites","4:139":"who choose the unbelievers to be their protectors rather than believers.

Whereas all honor belongs to Allah Alone","4:140":"He has already revealed for you in the Book that when you hear Allah’s revelations being denied or ridiculed by people, you must not sit with them unless they change the topic of their talk, otherwise you shall be considered guilty like them. Rest assured that Allah is going to gather the hypocrites and the unbelievers all together in hell","4:141":"These hypocrites are the ones who wait and watch to see how the wind blows. If Allah grants you a victory, they say: \"Were we not with you?\" And if the unbelievers gain success, they will say to them: \"Were we not strong enough to fight against you? Yet we protected you from the believers (Muslims).\" Allah will judge between you and them on the Day of Resurrection. Allah will not leave the way for the unbelievers to triumph over the believers","4:142":"Surely the hypocrites try to deceive Allah, whereas, in fact, He has reverted their deception to them; when they stand up for Salah they stand reluctantly, merely to be seen by people and do not remember Allah but a little","4:143":"wavering between belief and disbelief, belonging neither to this nor to that. Whom Allah lets go astray, you cannot find a Way for him","4:144":"O believers! Do not choose unbelievers to be your protecting friends instead of believers.

Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","4:153":"The People of the Book ask you to bring down for them a book from Heaven. From Moses they demanded an even harder miracle than that. They asked him: \"Make us see Allah with our own eyes.\" As a result of their wickedness, the thunderbolt overtook them. Then they took the calf for worship after receiving clear revelations. After all that, We still pardoned them and gave to Moses clear authority","4:154":"We lifted the mount of Tur over them and took the covenant from them that they will obey Our commandments. On another occasion We commanded them to enter the gates prostrating in humility. Yet on another occasion We commanded them not to transgress in the matter of the Sabbath and took a solemn commitment from them","4:155":"After all this, they still broke their covenant, rejected the Revelation of Allah, killed the Prophets unjustly.

They have no faith except a little","4:156":"They went in their unbelief to such an extent that they uttered terrible slander against Mary","4:157":"They even say: \"We have killed the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah.\" Whereas in fact, neither did they kill him nor did they crucify him but they thought they did because the matter was made dubious for them. Those who differ therein are only in doubt. They have no real knowledge, they follow nothing but merely a conjecture, certainly they did not kill him (Jesus)","4:158":"Nay! The fact is that Allah took him up to Himself. Allah is Mighty, Wise","4:159":"There is none of the People of the Book but will believe in this fact before his death; and on the Day of Resurrection Jesus will bear witness against them","4:160":"Because of the iniquity of those who call themselves Jews, their hindering of many people from the way of Allah","4:161":"taking of usury in spite of its prohibition, and cheating others of their properties - We made many wholesome things unlawful which were formerly lawful for them.

Do not transgress the limits of your religion. Speak nothing but the Truth about Allah. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary was no more than a Messenger of Allah and His Word \"Be\" which He bestowed on Mary and a Spirit from Him which took the shape of a child in her womb. So believe in Allah and His Messengers and do not say: \"Trinity\".\" Stop saying that, it is better for you. Allah is only One Deity. He is far above from the need of having a son! To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and in the Earth. Allah Alone is sufficient for protection","4:172":"The Messiah (Jesus) never disdained to be the worshipper of Allah nor do the angels who are nearest to Allah.

There has come to you convincing proof of Truth from your Lord. We have sent to you a glorious light (Al-Qur'an) that shows you the Right Way clearly","4:175":"Now those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him, Allah will soon cover them with His mercy and grace and will show them the Right Way to Himself","4:176":"They ask you for a legal decision relating to inheritance in the case of a childless person. Say: Allah gives you His decision about those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs. If a man dies childless and leaves behind a sister, she shall inherit one-half of his estate. If a woman dies childless, her brother will inherit all of her estate. If the childless person leaves behind two sisters, they both shall inherit two-third of his estate; but if he leaves more than two brothers and sisters, the share of each male shall be equal to that of two females. Thus Allah makes His commandments clear to you lest you go astray. Allah has perfect knowledge of everything","5:1":"O believers! Fulfil your contract obligations. All four-legged animals from livestock are lawful to you other than those which are hereby announced. However do not violate the prohibition of hunting while you are in Ihram (Hajj dress). Indeed Allah orders whatever He pleases","5:2":"O believers! Do not violate the sanctity of the Symbols of Allah: the Sacred Month , the animals brought for sacrifice, the garlands that mark such animals, and those people visiting the Sacred House (Ka'bah) to seek the grace and good pleasure of their Lord. When you put off your Ihram (pilgrimage is over) then you are allowed to hunt. Let not the hatred of some people - who once hindered you from the Sacred Mosque - incite you to commit transgression. Cooperate with one another in righteousness and piety, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression. Have fear of Allah. Allah is stern in punishment","5:3":"You are forbidden to eat the meat of any animal that dies by itself (dead body), blood, the flesh of swine (pork) and that on which any name other than Allah's has been invoked; also that which is strangled to death , killed by a violent blow, killed by a headlong fall and of those beaten or gored to death; and that which has been partly eaten by a wild animal unless you are able to slaughter it before its death; also that which is sacrificed on altars or is divided by raffling of arrows. All these are sinful acts. Today the unbelievers have given up all their hope of vanquishing your religion. Have no fear of them, fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you, completed my favor upon you and approved Al-Islam as a Deen (way of life for you).

Eat what they catch and hold for you, however, pronounce the name of Allah over it. Have fear of Allah. Allah is swift in settling the accounts","5:5":"Today all good clean things have been made lawful for you; and the food of the People of the Book is also made lawful for you and your food is made lawful for them. Likewise, marriage with chaste free believing women and also chaste women among the People who were given the Book before you is made lawful for you, provided that you give them their dowries and desire chastity, neither committing fornication nor taking them as mistresses. Anyone who commits Kufr with Iman (rejects the rules provided by faith), all his good deeds will be in vain and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers","5:6":"O believers! When you rise up for Salah (prayer), wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbows, wipe your heads with wet hands and wash your feet to the ankles. If you had an emission of semen, then take a full bath. However, if you are sick or on a journey or you have used the toilet or you had intercourse with your women (your wives) and you do not find any water then resort to Tayammum - find clean soil and rub your faces and hands with it. Allah does not wish to burden you; He only wishes to purify you and to perfect His favor upon you, so that you may be thankful","5:7":"Remember Allah’s favor to you and the covenant which He ratified with you when you said: \"We hear and we obey.\" Have fear of Allah; surely Allah knows the secrets of your hearts","5:8":"O believers! Be steadfast for the sake of Allah and bear true witness and let not the enmity of a people incite you to do injustice; do justice; that is nearer to piety. Fear Allah, surely Allah is fully aware of all your actions","5:9":"Allah has promised those who believe and do good deeds that for them there is forgiveness and mighty reward","5:10":"As for those who reject faith and deny Our revelations, they will be the companions of hellfire","5:11":"O believers! Also remember Allah’s favor which He recently bestowed upon you when He restrained the hands of those who sought to harm you (Jewish plan to kill the Prophet and eminent companions through an invitation to a dinner which Allah informed him not to attend). Have fear of Allah; and in Allah let the believers put their trust","5:12":"Allah did in fact make a covenant with the Children of Israel and appointed twelve chieftains from among them and said: \"I am with you; if you establish Salah (prayers) pay Zakah, believe in My Messengers, support them and give a generous loan to Allah (spend in charity), I will certainly forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow.

He creates what He pleases and has power over everything","5:18":"The Jews and the Christians say: \"We are the children of Allah and His beloved ones.\" Ask them, \"Why then does He punish you for your sins? Nay! In fact you are human beings like others which He has created. He forgives whom He pleases and He punishes whom He pleases.

Indeed Our Messenger has now come to you making clear to you the teaching of the Right Way, after a long break in the series of the Messengers, so that you may not be able to say, \"No one has come to give us good news or to warn us.\" Now someone has come to give you good news and warn you so listen to him.

Yet, even though Our Messengers came to them one after the other with clear revelations, it was not long before, many of them committed excesses in the land","5:33":"The punishment for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive to create mischief in the land is death or crucifixion or the cutting off their hands and feet from opposite sides or exile from the land based on the gravity of their offense.

Fear Allah and seek the means to be closer to Him and make Jihad (struggle) in His Way so that you may be successful","5:36":"As for those who are unbelievers, if they have everything that the earth contains or twice as much to offer as a ransom to redeem themselves from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them and they shall have a painful punishment","5:37":"They will desire to get out of the fire but will not be able to do so and they shall have an everlasting punishment","5:38":"Male or female, whoever is guilty of theft, cut off the hand (that was used in theft) of either of them as a punishment for their crime. This is exemplary punishment ordained by Allah. Allah is Mighty, Wise","5:39":"But whoever repents after committing the crime and reforms his conduct, Allah will surely turn to him with forgiveness. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","5:40":"Don’t you know that Allah has sovereignty over the heavens and the earth? He may punish whom He pleases and forgive whom He pleases. Allah has power over everything","5:41":"O Messenger! Do not grieve for those who plunge headlong into unbelief; those who say with their tongues: We believe, but have no faith in their hearts; and do not grieve for those Jews, who listen to lies and spy for other people who had never come to you. They tamper with the words of Allah and take them out of their context and say: \"If you are given such and such commandment, accept it; but if it is other than this, reject it.\" If Allah intends to put anyone to trial, you have no authority in the least to save him from Allah. Such people are those whose hearts Allah does not desire to purify; they will have humiliation in this world and a grievous punishment in the Hereafter","5:42":"That is because they listen to falsehood and eat what is forbidden. Therefore, if they come to you with their cases, you may judge between them or refuse to do so. Even if you refuse, they will not be able to harm you the least, but if you do act as a judge, judge between them with fairness, for Allah loves those who judge with fairness","5:43":"But why do they come to you for Judgment when they have the Torah which contains Allah’s commandments? Yet they turn back after that. In fact, they are not true believers","5:44":"Indeed We revealed the Torah to Moses, in which there is guidance and light: By its laws, all the Prophets, who were Muslims, judged those who call themselves Jews and so did the Rabbis and jurists of law. They were entrusted the protection of Allah’s Book and they themselves were witnesses. Have no fear of people; fear Me, and do not sell My revelations for a petty price: those who do not judge by the law which Allah has revealed, are indeed kafirs (unbelievers)","5:45":"We ordained in Torah for them: \"A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth and for a wound an equal retaliation.\" But if anyone remits the retaliation by way of charity it will be an act of atonement for him; those who do not judge by the law which Allah has revealed, they are the wrongdoers","5:46":"Then in the footsteps of those Prophets, We sent Jesus the son of Mary confirming whatever remained intact from the Torah in his time, and gave him the Gospel wherein was guidance and light, corroborating what was revealed in the Torah; a guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah","5:47":"Therefore, let the people who follow the Gospel judge by the Law which Allah has revealed therein; those who do not judge by the Law which Allah has revealed, they are the transgressors","5:48":"To you, O Muhammad, We have revealed this Book with the truth. It confirms whatever has remained intact in the scriptures which came before it and also to safeguard it. Therefore, judge between people according to Allah’s revelations and do not yield to their vain desires, diverging from the truth which has come to you. We have ordained a law and a Way of life for each of you. If Allah wanted He could have made all of you a single nation. But He willed otherwise in order to test you in what He has given you; therefore try to excel one another in good deeds. Ultimately you all shall return to Allah; then He will show you the truth of those matters in which you dispute","5:49":"So, O Muhammad, pronounce Judgment among them according to the law which Allah has revealed and do not follow their vain desires, and beware of them lest they tempt you away from a part of that which Allah has revealed to you. If they reject your Judgment, then know that it is Allah’s wish to scourge them for some of their sins. In fact most of the people are transgressors","5:50":"By rejecting the Divine Law do they wish to be judged by the laws of ignorance? Who is a better Judge than Allah for those who believe in Him","5:51":"O believers! Take neither Jews nor Christians as your protecting friends: they are only protecting friends of one another. Whoever of you disobeys this commandment will be counted as one of them. Surely Allah does not guide the wrongdoers","5:52":"You see that those who have the disease of hypocrisy in their hearts move around in their camp saying: \"We fear lest a turn of fortune strike us.\" But soon when Allah gives you victory or a decision according to His will, they will regret for what they are hiding in their hearts","5:53":"At that time the believers will say: \"Are these the same people who solemnly swore by Allah that they would stand beside you?\" As a result all their deeds will be voided and they will become losers","5:54":"O believers! Whoever among you renounce Islam, let them do so; soon Allah will replace them with others whom He will love and they will love Him, who will be humble towards the believers, mighty against the unbelievers, striving hard in the way of Allah, and will have no fear of reproach from any critic. Now this is the grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He pleases. Allah has boundless knowledge","5:55":"Your real protecting friends are Allah, His Messenger, and the fellow believers - the ones who establish Salah, pay Zakah and bow down humbly before Allah","5:56":"Whoever makes Allah, His Messenger and the fellow believers his protecting friends, must know that Allah’s party will surely be victorious","5:57":"O believers! Do not make your protecting friends those, from among the people who were given the Book before you and the unbelievers, who have made your religion a mockery or pastime, fear Allah if you are true believers","5:58":"When you call for Salah (prayers) they make it as an object of mockery and pastime; this is because they are a people devoid of understanding","5:59":"Tell them: \"O people of the Book! What makes you against us other than that we believe in Allah and in what has been revealed to us and what was revealed before? The fact is that most of you are rebellious transgressors","5:60":"Ask them: \"Should I tell you of those who will have even worse than this in retribution from Allah? They are those whom Allah has cursed; who have incurred His wrath; some of whom were turned into apes and pigs; who worshipped Taghut (forces of Satan); these are worse in rank and far more astray from the Right Way","5:61":"When they come to you they say: \"We believe\". But in fact, unbelievers they came and unbelievers they depart. Allah knows fully well what they hide in their hearts","5:62":"You will see many of them try to beat each other in sin and rancor, and they consume what is unlawful. Evil indeed is what they do","5:63":"Why don’t their Rabbis and the Jurists of laws forbid them from uttering sinful words and eating unlawful things? Evil indeed are their deeds","5:64":"The Jews say: Allah’s hand is tied up! - Nay! Their own hands will be tied up and they will be cursed for what they utter. Both of His hands are free; However, He spends as He pleases. The fact is that the revelations that have come to you from Allah will surely make many of them increase in their wickedness and unbelief. We have stirred among them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindle the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it. Now they are striving to spread mischief in the land. Allah does not love those who do mischief","5:65":"If instead of this rebellious attitude the people of the Book had believed and become Godfearing, We would certainly have removed their iniquities and admitted them to the gardens of Bliss (Paradise)","5:66":"If they would have observed the Laws of Torah and the Gospel and other Revelations which were sent to them from their Lord, they would have certainly enjoyed abundance from above and from beneath. Though there are some among them on the moderate course; yet most of them do nothing but evil","5:67":"O Messenger! Deliver the message which has been revealed to you from your Lord, and if you do not, you are not doing justice to your mission. Allah will protect you from the mischief of the people. Rest assured that Allah will not let the unbelievers succeed against you","5:68":"Tell them: O people of the Book! You have no ground to stand on unless you observe the Torah, Gospel and other revelations that have come to you from your Lord. This revelation (The Qur'an) which has come to you from your Lord will surely increase the rebellion and disbelief of many of them but you should not grieve for the disbelievers","5:69":"Rest assured that the believers (Muslims), the Jews, the Sabians and the Christians - whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does righteous deeds - will have nothing to fear or to regret","5:70":"Certainly We took a covenant from the Children of Israel and sent them Messengers. Whenever there came to them a Messenger with a message that did not suit their fancies, either they called him an impostor or they put him to death","5:71":"They thought no affliction would follow; so they acted blind and deaf. Yet Allah, in extreme mercy, accepted their repentance, but again many acted blind and deaf towards the message of Allah. Allah is observant of their actions","5:72":"Certainly they have disbelieved who say: \"Allah is Christ the son of Mary.\" While Christ himself said: \"O children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" Whoever commits shirk (joins partners with Allah), Allah will deny him the paradise, and the hellfire will be his home. There will be no helper for the wrongdoers","5:73":"Certainly they are unbelievers who say: \"Allah is one of three in a Trinity.\" There is no god except One Allah. If they do not stop saying what they say, a painful punishment will befall the disbelievers among them","5:74":"Will they not then turn to Allah and seek His forgiveness? Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","5:75":"Christ, the son of Mary, was no more than a Messenger; many Messengers had already passed away before him. His mother was a truthful woman; they both ate earthly food like other human beings. See how the Revelations are made clear to them to know the reality; yet see how they ignore the truth","5:76":"Ask them: \"Would you worship besides Allah someone who can neither harm nor benefit you? While Allah is He who hears all and knows all","5:77":"Tell them: \"O people of the Book! Do not transgress the bounds of truth in your religion, and do not yield to the fancies of those people who went astray before you, They misled many others and have themselves strayed away from The Right Way","5:78":"Those who disbelieved from among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of Davidand Jesus the son of Mary: because they disobeyed and committed excesses","5:79":"They would not forbid one another from committing iniquities; evil indeed were their deeds","5:80":"As you can see many of them are taking the side of the unbelievers. Evil is that, which their souls have sent forth for them for the Hereafter. Because they have incurred the wrath of Allah, so in punishment, they are going to live forever","5:81":"Had they believed in Allah, in the Prophet, and in what was revealed to him, they would have never taken unbelievers as their protecting friends instead of believers, but most of them are rebellious transgressors","5:82":"You will find the most violent in enmity to the believers are the Jews and the pagans (pagan Arabs); and nearest in affection to the believers are those who say: \"We are Christians.\" That is because among them there are men that are priests and monks, who do not behave arrogantly","5:83":"When they (monks and priests) listen to that which is revealed to the Messenger, you can see their eyes filled with tears, because they recognize the truth. They say: \"Our Lord! We believe, therefore, write us down among the witnesses of truth","5:84":"Why should not we believe in Allah and the truth which has come to us? Why should we not hope that our Lord will admit us to the company of the righteous","5:85":"And for their prayer Allah has rewarded them with gardens beneath which rivers flow to live therein forever. Such is the recompense of the righteous (who do good to others)","5:86":"As for those who reject and deny Our revelations, they shall become the inmates of hellfire","5:87":"O believers! Do not make unlawful those wholesome things which Allah has made lawful for you. Do not transgress; Allah does not love the transgressors","5:88":"Eat of the lawful and wholesome things which Allah has provided for you. Fear Allah, in Whom you believe","5:89":"Allah will not call you to account for what is inadvertent in your oaths. But He will hold you accountable for that which you solemnly swear. The penalty for a broken oath is to feed ten indigent persons with such food as you normally provide to your own family, or to clothe ten needy people, or to free one slave. The one who cannot afford any of these must fast three days. This is the expiation for breaking your oaths. Therefore, be mindful of your oaths. Thus Allah makes clear to you His revelations that you may be thankful","5:90":"O believers! Intoxicants and gambling (games of chance), dedication to stones (paying tribute to idols) and division by arrows (lottery) are the filthy works of Satan. Get away from them, so that you may prosper","5:91":"Satan desires to stir up enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling and to prevent you from the remembrance of Allah and from Salah (prayers). Will you not abstain","5:92":"Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and abstain from these things. If you do not, then you should know that Our Messenger’s duty is only to pass on My message clearly","5:93":"There is no blame on those who believe and do good deeds for what they ate in the past, provided they abstain from those things which have been made unlawful, then remain steadfast in their belief and do righteous deeds, then abstain themselves from whatever they are forbidden and believe in Divine Law, and then fear Allah and do good deeds. For Allah loves those who do good deeds","5:94":"O believers! Allah will put you to trial by making game (that which is to be hunted) well within the reach of your hands and your spears in order to see who fears Him, though unseen. There shall, therefore, be a painful punishment for those who transgress after this warning","5:95":"O believers! Do not kill game while you are in Ihram (pilgrim garb). If anyone kills game intentionally, he will have to pay a penalty through an offering brought to the Ka’bah of a domestic animal equivalent to the one which was killed as determined by two just men among you; or as an expiation, either feed a few indigent or fast their equivalent days, so that he may taste the evil consequences of what he did. Allah has forgiven what happened in the past; but if anyone repeats it now, Allah will inflict retribution on him. Allah is Mighty, Capable of Retribution","5:96":"Game of the sea and its use as food is lawful for you and the seafarers, but the game of the land is forbidden as long as you are in Ihram (pilgrim garb). Have fear of Allah to whom you shall all be assembled","5:97":"Allah has made the Ka‘bah of the Sacred House an eternal value for mankind, and so are the Sacred Months, the animal offerings, and the animals which are collared as a mark of dedication; so you must know that Allah has knowledge of what is in the heavens and in the earth and that Allah is well aware of everything","5:98":"You should also know that Allah is stern in Retribution, and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","5:99":"The only duty of the Messenger is to pass on My Message. Allah knows all what you reveal and what you conceal","5:100":"Tell them, \"Bad and good are not equal, even though the abundance of the bad may dazzle you; so fear Allah, O people of understanding, that you may prosper","5:101":"O believers! Do not ask questions about things that if revealed to you, may cause you trouble. But if you ask a question about something when the Qur’an is being revealed, it will be made known to you. Allah has forgiven you what you did to date, Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing","5:102":"Some people before you did ask such questions and later lost their faith because of those very things","5:103":"Allah did not institute superstitions like those of a slit-ear she-camel or a she-camel let loose for free pasture or idol sacrifices for twin-births in animals or stallion-camels freed from work; this lie is invented by the unbelievers against Allah, and most of them lack understanding","5:104":"When it is said to them: \"Come to what Allah has revealed and come to the Messenger.\" They reply: \"Sufficient for us are the ways on which we found our forefathers.\" What! Even though their forefathers knew nothing and were not rightly guided","5:105":"O believers! You are accountable for none but for yourselves; anyone who has gone astray cannot harm you if you are on the Right Way. To Allah you shall all return and He will let you know the truth of all that you did","5:106":"O believers! When death approaches any one of you, let two just men from among yourselves act as witnesses at the time of making your last will; or from the non-Muslims if you are travelling through the land and the calamity of death overtakes you. If you doubt their honesty, detain them after prayer and let them both swear by Allah: \"We will not sell our testimony for any price, even to a relative, and we will not hide the testimony which we will be giving for the sake of Allah; for we shall be sinners if we do so","5:107":"Then, if it becomes known that those two were guilty of the sin of perjury, then let two others better qualified witnesses from among those who were deprived of their right come forward and testify upon oath, \"By Allah, our testimony is truer than theirs. We have not transgressed in our testimony; for we should be wrongdoers if we did so","5:108":"By this procedure, it is more likely that they will bear true witness or at least fear that their oaths could be contradicted by subsequent oaths. Have fear of Allah and listen; Allah does not guide to those who are disobedient transgressors","5:109":"On the Day of Resurrection when Allah gathers the Messengers and asks: \"What response were you given from your addressees?\" They will say: \"We have no knowledge, only You have all the knowledge of the unseen","5:110":"Then Allah will ask: \"O Jesus son of Mary! Recall my favor upon you and to your mother, how I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit, so you could speak to the people in cradle and in old age, how I taught you the Book, Wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel. How you were able to make the figure of a bird out of a clay, by My permission, how you breathed into it and changed it into a real bird, by My permission. How you could heal the born-blind and the lepers by My permission. How you could bring the dead body back to life by My permission. How I protected you from the violence of the Children of Israel when you came to them with clear signs and the unbelievers among them said: \"This is nothing but a clear sorcery","5:111":"Remember, when I inspired the disciples to have faith in Me and My Messenger and they said: ‘We believe and bear witness that we have become Muslims","5:112":"How when the disciples asked: \"O Jesus, son of Mary! Can your Lord send down to us from heaven a table spread with food?\" And you said: \"Have fear of Allah if you are true believers","5:113":"They said: \"We only wish to eat thereof to satisfy our hearts and to know that you have indeed told us the truth, and that we bear witness to it","5:114":"Jesus, son of Mary said: \"O Allah, our Lord! Send us from heaven a table spread with food that it may mark a feast, one of a kind for those before us and for those after us, as a sign from You; and provide us our sustenance, You are the best Sustainer","5:115":"Allah responded: \"I shall send it down to you, but if any of you disbelieve after that, I shall punish him with a torment which I have never inflicted on anyone in the worlds","5:116":"After reminding him of these favors, Allah will say: \"O Jesus, son of Mary, Did you ever say to the people, \"worship me and my mother as gods beside Allah?\" He will answer: \"Glory to You! How could I say what I had no right to say? If I had ever said so, you would have certainly known it. You know what is in my heart, but I know not what is in Yours; for You have full knowledge of all the unseen","5:117":"I never said anything other than what You commanded me to say, that is to worship Allah, Who is my Lord and your Lord. I was a witness over them as long as I remained among them; but when You called me off, You were the Watcher over them and You are a Witness to everything","5:118":"If You punish them, they surely are Your servants; and if You forgive them, You are Mighty, Wise","5:119":"Allah will say: \"This is the day on which the truthful will profit from their truth; they shall have gardens beneath which rivers flow to live therein forever. Allah is well-pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. This is the mighty achievement","5:120":"To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is therein, and He has power over everything","6:1":"All praise be to Allah, the One Who has created the heavens and the earth and made the darkness and the light; yet the unbelievers set up equal partners with their Lord","6:2":"He is the One Who has created you from clay, then decreed a fixed term of life and set a deadline for you Himself; yet you go on doubting","6:3":"He is the same One Allah in both the heavens and the earth. He knows what you conceal, what you reveal and what you do","6:4":"Yet the reaction of the people has been that whenever a revelation came to them from their Lord, they neglected it","6:5":"Now that the truth has come to them, they have denied it. Soon they will come to know the reality which they are ridiculing","6:6":"Have they not seen how many generations We have destroyed before them? We had made those nations more powerful in the land than yourselves. We sent down for them abundant rain from the sky and made the rivers to flow beneath their feet: yet for their sins We destroyed them all and raised up other generations in their places","6:7":"O Prophet, if We had sent to you a Book written on paper and they could have touched it with their own hands, the unbelievers would still have said: \"This is nothing but plain sorcery","6:8":"They ask: \"Why has no angel been sent down to us?\" Well, if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been settled at once and no respite would have been granted after that","6:9":"and if We had sent an angel, We would have certainly sent him in a human form and thus involved them in the same confusion as they are in at this time","6:10":"O Muhammad! many Messengers before you were also ridiculed, but in the long run those who ridiculed were hemmed in by the very thing they were ridiculing","6:11":"O Muhammad, say: \"Travel through the earth and see what was the end of those who denied the truth","6:12":"Ask them: \"To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth?\" If they don't respond, tell them: \"To Allah!\" He has decreed mercy for Himself, that is why He does not punish you for your misdeeds right away. He will certainly gather you all together on the Day of Resurrection; there is no doubt about it. Yet those who have lost their souls will not believe","6:13":"To Him belongs all that takes rest in the night and in the day. He is the Hearer, the Knower","6:14":"Say: \"Should I take as my protector anyone other than Allah, who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. Who feeds all and is fed by none?\" Say: \"Nay! I am commanded to be the first of those who submit to Allah in Islam and not of those who commit shirk","6:15":"Say: \"I will never disobey my Lord, for I fear the torment of a Mighty Day","6:16":"He who is delivered from the torment of that Day, has indeed received Allah’s Mercy; and this is a clear cut achievement","6:17":"If Allah afflicts you with any harm, none can relieve you other than Him; and if He blesses you with happiness, you should know that He has power over everything","6:18":"He is the Supreme Authority over His servants; and He is the Wise, the Aware","6:19":"Ask them: \" Whose testimony is the most reliable? \" When they say Allah, then tell them: \"Let Allah be Witness between me and you (that I am the Messenger of Allah) and this Qur’an has been revealed to me by Him so that I may warn you thereby and all those whom it may reach. Can you really testify that there are other gods besides Allah?\" Tell them: \"As far as I am concerned I will never testify to this!\" Say: \"Indeed He is the One and the Only God and I am absolutely disgusted with the shirk you commit","6:20":"Those to whom We have given the Book know this fact as they know their own sons. In fact those who have lost their souls, will not believe","6:21":"Who can be more wicked than a person who forges a lie against Allah or denies His revelations? Surely the wrongdoers shall never get salvation","6:22":"On the Day of Judgment when We shall gather them all together, We shall ask the pagans: \"Where are those deities whom you ascribed to be My partners","6:23":"They will have no argument but to say: \"By Allah, our Lord, we were not at all pagan","6:24":"See how they will lie against their own souls, and how the deities of their own inventions will leave them in the lurch","6:25":"Of them there are some who pretend that they listen to you; but their prejudices have dulled their faculties and We have cast veils over their hearts and deafness in their ears so they are unable to understand. Even if they see every one of Our Signs, they will not believe. So much so, that when they come to you, they argue with you. The unbelievers say: \"These are nothing but tales of the old times","6:26":"They themselves have turned away from the truth and also forbid other people to believe in it. With such a behavior they harm none but their own souls but they do not perceive it","6:27":"If you could witness the scene, when they will be made to stand before the hellfire, they will say: \"We wish we could return to earthly life again; then we would not deny the revelations of our Lord, and we would join the believers","6:28":"In fact, they will say this because they had come to know the reality which they were concealing before. As a matter of fact even if they be sent back, they would certainly repeat the same things which they had been forbidden to do. Indeed they are liars","6:29":"Today they say: \"There is no other life except the life on this earth and we shall never be raised to life again","6:30":"If you could witness the scene when they will be brought before their Lord; He will ask, \"Is this not a reality?\" They will say: \"Yes, our Lord, this is the reality.\" He will order: \"Well, then taste the punishment for denying this reality","6:31":"Those people are indeed lost who deny that they will ever meet Allah. When the hour of Doomsday will overtake them all of a sudden, they will exclaim: \"Alas! How negligent we have been about this Hour.\" They will be carrying the burden of their sins on their backs; and evil indeed are the burdens that they carry","6:32":"The life of this world is nothing but play and amusement, but the life of the Hereafter will be better for those who are righteous. Will you not use your common sense","6:33":"O Muhammad We know it well that what they say grieves you: it is not you that they deny, these wrongdoers actually deny the revelations of Allah","6:34":"Many Messengers before you were denied but patiently bore with their denial and persecution until Our help came down to them: for none can change the decrees of Allah. You have already received the news of what happened to those Messengers","6:35":"If you find their aversion hard to bear, then see if you can make a tunnel in the ground or put a ladder to ascend in the skies by which you can bring them a sign. O Prophet, you know well that if Allah wanted, He would have given guidance to all. So do not be like the ignorant","6:36":"Surely those who listen accept the Truth. As for the dead (those with closed minds), Allah will bring them back to life, on the Day of Judgment, to be produced in His court","6:37":"They ask: \"Why has a sign not been sent down to him from his Lord?\" Tell them: \"Allah is surely able to send down a Sign; but most of them do not understand the wisdom behind it","6:38":"If you really want to see the signs of Allah, just look at any animal that walks upon the earth and any bird that flies in the air; they too are the communities like you. We have not left out anything from the Book in determining the courses of their lives. They all shall be gathered before their Lord","6:39":"Those who deny Our Revelations are deaf and dumb, living in many layers of darkness. Allah confounds whom He will, and guides to the Right Way whom He pleases","6:40":"Ask them to think carefully and answer: \"When you face a disaster or the last Hour approaches you, do you call for help anyone other than Allah? Answer me if you are truthful","6:41":"No, on Him Alone you will call, and forget those whom you have set up as His partners; then if He pleases, He relieves you from the affliction about which you have prayed to Him","6:42":"We did send Messengers before you to other nations and afflicted them with suffering and adversities so that they might learn humility","6:43":"Why did they not humble themselves when the sufferings overtook them? On the contrary their hearts became hardened and Satan made their sinful acts seem fair to them","6:44":"When they neglected the warning they had received, then, instead of punishment, We opened the gates of every kind of prosperity for them; but just as they were rejoicing in what they were given, We suddenly seized them; lo! They were plunged into despair","6:45":"Thus We cut off the roots of the wrongdoers. All praises are due to Allah the Lord of the worlds","6:46":"Ask them: \"Just think, if Allah takes away your hearing and your sight and seals up your hearts, is there any deity other than Allah who could restore them to you?\" See how We present Our revelations over and over again and yet they turn away","6:47":"Say: \"Just think if the punishment of Allah comes to you whether suddenly or openly, would any be destroyed other than the wrongdoers","6:48":"We have sent the Messengers only to give good news and to warn: so those who believe and mend their ways shall have nothing to fear or to regret","6:49":"But those who deny Our Revelations shall be punished for their transgression","6:50":"Say: \"I do not claim that I possess the treasures of Allah, or that I know the unseen nor do I claim that I am an angel. What I say is that I follow only that which is revealed to me.\" Ask them: \"Are the blind and the seeing alike? Why don’t you think","6:51":"O Muhammad, admonish with this (The Qur'an), those who have the fear of being assembled before their Lord in such a condition that there will be no one to protect them or intercede on their behalf other than Him. It may be that, by this admonition, they may become righteous","6:52":"Do not drive away those (poor people like Bilal, Ammar and Suhaib) who call on their Lord morning and evening, seeking only to gain His favor. You are in no way accountable for their deeds nor they are in any way accountable for yours. So if you drive them away, you shall be counted among the wrongdoers","6:53":"That’s how We have made some of them (poor and slaves who accepted Islam) a means for testing the others (the chiefs of Qureysh), so that they should say: \"Are these the people whom Allah favors among us (the poor, indigent and low class)?\" Well, does Allah not know best those who are grateful","6:54":"When those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say: \"Peace be upon you. Your Lord has decreed mercy upon Himself. If anyone among you commits evil because of ignorance and thereafter repents and mends his ways; you will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful","6:55":"Thus, We spell out Our revelations, so that the way of the culprits may become evident","6:56":"O Muhammad, tell them: \"I am forbidden to worship those whom you call upon besides Allah.\" Say: \"I am not going to follow your wishes: if I do, I would be lost and cease to be from the rightly guided","6:57":"Say: \"I am on a clear proof from my Lord which you have denied, but the scourge of Allah, which you are in such a rush to see, is not in my power. No one has the authority of passing Judgment except Allah: He declares the truth and He is the best of Judges","6:58":"Say: \"If what you rush to see was in my power, the matter between you and me would have been settled long ago; but Allah knows best how to deal with wrongdoers","6:59":"He Alone has the keys of the unseen treasures, of which no one knows except Him. He knows whatever is in the land and in the sea; there is not a single leaf that falls without His knowledge, there is neither a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry which has not been recorded in a Clear Book","6:60":"He is the One Who takes your souls at night (makes you go to sleep) and knows what you do during the day, then next day raises you up again to complete your allotted span of life. To Him you shall all return, then He will notify you of all that you have done","6:61":"He is the Irresistible (reigns supreme) over his servants and sends guardian angels over you. At length, when death approaches anyone of you, Our angels take his soul and they are not negligent in performing their duty","6:62":"Then those souls are brought back to Allah, their real Master. Beware! He is the Judge and He is the swiftest in settling accounts","6:63":"Ask them: \"Who delivers you from calamities in the darkness of the land and of the sea, when you call upon Him in open humility and silent terror: If You deliver us from this affliction, we shall become truly grateful","6:64":"Say: \"Allah delivers you from these and all other calamities, yet you commit shirk (worship false gods)","6:65":"Say: \"He has the power to send calamities on you from above and from below or to split you into discordant factions to make you taste the violence of one another. See how We present Our revelations over and over again so that they may understand the reality","6:66":"But your people are rejecting this (The Qur'an), although it is the very truth.\" Tell them: \"I am not appointed as your caretaker","6:67":"For every prophecy there is an appointed time, and soon you will come to know","6:68":"When you see those who are engaged in arguments about Our revelations, turn away from them until they change their topic of discussion. If Satan ever makes you forget this commandment, then as soon as you realize, withdraw from the company of wrongdoers","6:69":"Though righteous people will not be held responsible for wrongdoers' actions, yet it is their duty to admonish them; perhaps they may refrain from evil deeds","6:70":"Leave those people alone, who take their religion as mere play and amusement and are deceived by the life of this world. However, keep on admonishing them with this (The Qur'an), lest their souls be damned by their own sinful deeds. They will not have any protector or intercessor to rescue them from Allah, and if they seek to offer every imaginable ransom, it shall not be accepted from them. Such are those who are damned by their own sinful deeds. They will get boiling water to drink and painful torture for their rejection of the Truth","6:71":"Ask the pagans: \"Should we call on those, instead of Allah, who can neither benefit us nor harm us? Should we turn upon our heels after Allah has guided us to the Right Way? Like the one whom Satan has misled and is wandering around in the land, while his friends are calling him to the right way, shouting: \"Come this way!\" Tell them: \"Allah’s guidance is the only guidance. We are commanded to surrender (become Muslims) to the Lord of the worlds","6:72":"to establish Salah and fear Him, before Whom you shall all be assembled on the Day of Judgment","6:73":"He is the One Who has created the heavens and the earth to manifest the Truth. On the Day when He will say: \"Be,\" it shall be (the Day of Resurrection). His Word is the truth. He shall be the sole Sovereign on the Day when the trumpet will be blown. He has the full knowledge of the invisible and the visible. He is the Wise, the Aware","6:74":"Tell them about Abraham, who said to Azer, his father: \"Are you taking idols for gods? Surely, I see you and your people in manifest error","6:75":"We showed Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth , as We show you with examples from nature, so he became one of the firm believers","6:76":"When the night drew its shadow over him, he saw a star and said, \"this is my Lord.\" But when it set, he said: \"I do not love to worship such a god that fades away","6:77":"Afterwards he saw the moon shining, he said; \"This is my Lord.\" But when it also set, he cried: \"If my Lord does not guide me, I shall certainly become one of those who go astray","6:78":"Then when he saw the sun with its brighter shine, and he said: \"This must be my Lord; it is larger than the other two.\" But when it also set, he exclaimed: \"O my people! I am done with your shirk (associating partners with Allah)","6:79":"As far as I am concerned, I will turn my face, being upright, to Him Who has created the heavens and the earth, and I am not one of the pagans","6:80":"When his people started arguing with him, he told them: \"Will you argue with me about Allah, whereas He Himself has guided me? I do not fear those whom you take for gods besides Him, none can harm me unless my Lord so wills, the knowledge of my Lord encompasses everything, why don’t you get admonition","6:81":"Why should I fear your idols, when you are not afraid of your actions of making them partners with Allah, for which He has not given you any sanction? Which one from the two parties of us deserves to feel secure? Tell me, if you know the truth","6:82":"As a matter of fact those who believe and do not taint their faith with wrongdoings will feel more secure and will be better guided","6:83":"This was the argument which We furnished Abraham against his people. We exalt in ranks whom We please; surely your Lord is Wise, Aware","6:84":"We gave him Isaac and Jacob and guided them all as We guided Noah before them, and among his descendants were David (David), Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses and Haroon (Aaron); thus do We reward those who do good to others","6:85":"Other descendants include Zakariya, John, Jesus, and Ilyas (Elias); all of them were righteous","6:86":"and Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah and Lot. We exalted every one of them over the worlds","6:87":"as We exalted some of their forefathers, their children and their brothers. We chose them for Our service and guided them to the Right Way","6:88":"This is the guidance from Allah; He bestows it upon whom He pleases of His devotees. If they had committed shirk (worshiped anyone else besides Allah) all their deeds would have become void","6:89":"Such were the people to whom We gave the Book, wisdom and Prophethood. Now if these people deny this guidance, it does not matter; We would bestow this guidance upon other people who would not disbelieve","6:90":"O Muhammad, those were the people who were rightly guided by Allah, therefore, follow their guidance and tell these people: \"I am not asking you any compensation for this work of delivering the Message to you, this message is nothing but a reminder to all the worlds","6:91":"Those people have not valued the attributes of Allah, the way His attributes should be valued, who say: \"Allah has never revealed anything to a human being.\" Ask them: \"Who then sent down the Book (Torah) which Moses brought, a light and guidance for mankind? You have transcribed it on separate sheets, publishing some and suppressing much of that given knowledge, which neither you nor your forefathers previously possessed.\" If they do not answer, then just say: \"Allah\" and leave them alone with the discourse of their useless arguments","6:92":"This is the blessed Book, like the one given to Moses, which We have revealed, confirming what came before it, that you, O Muhammad, may warn the people living in the Mother City (Mecca) and those who live around her. Those who believe in the hereafter, will believe in this (Book) and will be steadfast in taking care of their Salah (prescribed prayers)","6:93":"Who can be more wicked than the one who invents a lie against Allah, or says: \"This was revealed to me,\" while nothing was revealed to him? Or the one who says: \"I can reveal the like of what Allah has revealed?\" If you could only see these wrongdoers when they are in the agonies of death and the angels stretch forth their hands saying, \"Take out your soul! Today you will be rewarded with a disgraceful punishment for saying falsehood against Allah which you had no right to say and showing arrogance against His revelations","6:94":"Allah adds to what the angels said, \"So you have come back to Us Alone as We created you at the first time, leaving behind all that which We gave you in that world and We don’t see with you your intercessors, whom you claimed to be Allah’s partners in your affairs; all your ties have been cut off and what you presumed has failed you","6:95":"Surely it is Allah Who causes the seed and the fruit-stone to split and sprout. He brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living. It is Allah, Who does all this; then why are you being misled","6:96":"He causes the daybreak from the dark. He makes the night for rest and makes the rising and setting of the sun and the moon for you to determine times ( days, weeks, months and years), these are the arrangements of the Almighty, the All-Knowing","6:97":"He is the One Who has made the stars for you, so that you might find your way thereby in the darkness whether you are on the land or the sea. We have spelled out Our revelations very clearly for people of common sense","6:98":"He is the One Who has created you from a single soul and granted you dwelling on Earth and a resting place in the hereafter. We have spelled out Our revelation very clearly for people of understanding","6:99":"It is He Who sends down rainwater from the sky and therewith produces vegetation of all kinds: He brings forth green crops producing grain piled up in the ear, palm-trees laden with clusters of dates hanging within reach, gardens of grapes, olives, and pomegranates; though their fruit resembles in kind yet is different in variety. Look at their fruits as they yield and ripen. Behold! In these things there are signs for true believers","6:100":"Yet they make the Jinns (Genies: creature which has been created out of fire) as the partners with Allah, whereas He is their Creator; and also ascribe to Him sons and daughters without having any knowledge. Glory to Him! He is highly exalted far above what they ascribe","6:101":"He is the creator of the heavens and the earth. How could He have a son when He has no consort? He has created everything and is aware of everything","6:102":"That is Allah your Lord! There is no god but Him, the creator of everything. Therefore, worship Him, He is the Guardian of everything","6:103":"No vision can grasp Him while He grasps all visions. He is the Subtle, the Aware","6:104":"Now there have come to you clear proofs from your Lord to open your eyes. Therefore, anyone who will open his eyes, it is good for his own soul and anyone who will play blind, it is to his own harm, and I am the Prophet, not assigned as a keeper over you","6:105":"Thus do We explain Our revelations over and over again so that the unbelievers may say: \"You have learned from someone, but not from Allah\" and that this may become clear to people of understanding","6:106":"Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord, there is no god but Him and turn aside from the pagans","6:107":"If Allah wanted they would not be pagans. We have neither appointed you their keeper nor made you their guardian","6:108":"O believers, do not insult those, whom these pagans call upon besides Allah, lest in retaliation they call bad names to Allah out of their ignorance. Thus We have made the deeds of every group of people seem fair to them. In the end they will all return to their Lord and then, He will inform them of the reality of all that they have done","6:109":"These pagans solemnly swear by Allah that if a Sign came to them they would most certainly believe in your Prophethood. Say: \"All signs are vouchsafed by Allah.\" What should make you understand that if a sign comes to them they will still not believe","6:110":"We will turn away their hearts and their eyes from the Truth because of their attitude which prompted them to disbelieve in the first place, and We will leave them to wander in their rebellious wrongdoing","6:111":"Even if We had sent to them the angels, made the dead speak to them, and presented all the different things of the world before them as proof, they would have not believed, unless Allah wanted otherwise (and forcing someone to believe is not what He wants): Yet most of them act out of ignorance","6:112":"Like this Messenger, We had granted each Messenger his opponents - Satans from among the human beings and Jinns - some of them inspire the others with seductive discourses of deception. If your Lord wanted, they would not have done so. Therefore, neglect them as well as what they invent","6:113":"so that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may be inclined to what they say, and be pleased with it; and so that they can earn what they wish to earn","6:114":"Say: Should I seek a judge other than Allah, when He is the One Who has revealed this Book (The Qur'an) with full details? Those whom We gave the Book, before you, know very well that it is revealed to you from your Lord with the Truth; therefore, you should not be of those who have doubts","6:115":"The Words of your Lord have been completed with credibility and justice; there is no way to change His Words. He is the Hearer, the Knower","6:116":"If you obey (other than the Messenger, then you should know that) most of the people on earth will lead you away from the Way of Allah, for they follow nothing but guesswork and preach nothing but falsehood","6:117":"In fact, your Lord knows best those people who have strayed from His Way and He knows best those who are on the Right Way","6:118":"So eat of that meat on which Allah’s name has been pronounced if you truly believe in His revelations","6:119":"Why should you not eat that on which Allah’s name has been pronounced, when He has clearly spelled out for you in detail what is forbidden - except in a case of extreme helplessness? In fact, many do mislead people by their appetites unchecked by knowledge. Your Lord knows best those who transgress","6:120":"Eschew all sin whether open or secret: surely those who earn sin will get due punishment for their wrongdoings","6:121":"Do not eat of that meat on which Allah’s name has not been pronounced, since that is most surely a transgression. In fact the Satans inspire their friends that they should argue with you, and if you obey them, most surely you will be considered a pagan","6:122":"Can a person who was dead (ignorant), and whom We raised to life and gave the Light to walk with among people, be like the one who is in the depths of darkness from which he can never come out? Since they treat both of them alike, the actions of the unbelievers are made lucrative to them","6:123":"and that is why in every town We have placed the criminals as their ring leaders to plot therein, they plot against none but their own souls, though they do not perceive it","6:124":"Whenever there comes to them a sign (verses of The Qur'an) they say: \"We shall not believe until we are given directly that which is given to the Messengers of Allah.\" Allah knows best to whom He should give His Message. Soon these criminals will be overtaken by humiliation and by a severe punishment from Allah for their evil plots","6:125":"Whomever Allah wills to guide, He opens his chest to Islam and whomever He intends to confound, He makes his chest narrow and squeezes so tight that, at the very idea of Islam, he feels as if his soul is going to climb up towards the sky. That is how Allah places a blight on those who do not believe","6:126":"whereas in fact this way (Al-Islam) is the Right Way of your Lord and We have spelled out Our revelations very clearly for the people who use their common sense","6:127":"For them there will be a home of peace with their Lord. He will be their protector because of their good deeds","6:128":"On the Day when He will assemble them all together, (Allah will address the Jinns): \"O assembly of Jinns! You seduced mankind in great number.\" And their votaries from among mankind will say: \"Our Lord, we have both enjoyed each other's fellowship but alas! Now we have reached the end of our term which You had decreed for us.\" Then Allah will say: \"Now hellfire is your dwelling-place; you will live therein forever unless Allah ordains otherwise.\" Surely your Lord is Wise, Knowledgeable","6:129":"That is how, in the hereafter, We will make wrongdoers the comrades of one another on account of what they earned during their life on Earth with evil friendship","6:130":"At that time Allah will also ask: \"O Assembly of Jinns and mankind! Did not there come to you the Messengers from amongst you who proclaimed to you My revelations and warned you about the meeting of this Day?\" They will reply: \"Yes they did, We bear witness against our own souls.\" Today this worldly life has deceived them but on that Day they will testify against themselves that they were indeed kuffar (unbelievers)","6:131":"Your Lord would not destroy towns without just cause while their residents were ignorant of the Reality","6:132":"All will be awarded ranks according to their deeds, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do","6:133":"Your Lord is Self-Sufficient, Lord of Mercy. If He wants, He can destroy you all and replace you with others as He pleases, just as He raised you from the offspring of other people","6:134":"Surely what you are being threatened with, must come to pass and you can do nothing about it","6:135":"O Muhammad, tell them: \"O my people! If you don’t listen to me, do whatever you want and I’ll do whatever I deem right; you will soon find out who is to gain the reward of the hereafter; rest assured that the wrongdoers will not get salvation","6:136":"They set aside a share of their produce and of their cattle for Allah, saying: \"This is for Allah\" - so they pretend - \"and this for our shoraka' (their assigned partners of Allah).\" Their shoraka's share does not reach Allah, but the share of Allah is wholly given to shoraka'. What an evil decision they make","6:137":"Their shoraka' have induced many pagans to kill their own children in order to ruin them and confuse them in their religion. If Allah wanted, they would not have done so. Therefore, leave them alone with their false inventions","6:138":"These pagans say that such and such cattle and crops are reserved, in the name of such and such temple, and no one should eat except those whom we permit - in fact these restrictions they themselves have imposed. Then there are some animals which they have prohibited from riding or carrying loads, and there are still other animals over which they do not pronounce the name of Allah. They have falsely attributed all these things to Him. Soon He will requite them for their invented lies","6:139":"They also say: \"The offspring of these cattle is specially reserved for our males and forbidden to our females but if it is stillborn then all can share together.\" Soon He will punish them for their attribution of such superstitions to Allah. Surely He is Wise, Knowledgeable","6:140":"Actual losers are those who kill their own children foolishly without knowledge and forbid food which Allah has provided them, falsely ascribing prohibitions to Allah. Certainly they have gone astray and are not at all rightly guided","6:141":"It is He who has created all kinds of plants, trellised and untrellised, the palm trees, the field crops with produce of different kinds, the olives and pomegranates, similar in kind yet different in taste. Eat of their fruit in their season and give away their Zakah on the harvest day. Do not be spendthrift, surely He does not love the spendthrifts","6:142":"Of the animals you have, some are for transportation and some for slaughter. Eat of that which Allah has provided for you and do not follow the footsteps of Satan; surely he is your open enemy","6:143":"For eight heads of cattle, male and female, there are superstitions. Take a pair of sheep and a pair of goats, for example, and ask them, \"Of these, has He forbidden you the males, females or their fetuses? Answer me based on knowledge, not superstition, if what you say is true","6:144":"Likewise ask them about a pair of camels and a pair of cows, \"Of these, has He forbidden you the males, females or their fetuses?\" If they answer, then ask them: \"Were you present when Allah gave you these commandments?\" If not then Who can be more unjust than the one who forges a lie against Allah, so that he may mislead mankind without having any knowledge? Surely Allah does not guide the unjust people","6:145":"O Muhammad tell them: I did not find in what has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, except the meat of an already dead animal, or running blood or the flesh of swine (pork) - for these are unclean - or flesh of an animal which has become profane because of slaughtering in the names other than Allah. Even so, if anyone is forced in a helpless situation, intending neither disobedience nor transgression, you will find your Lord Forgiving, Merciful","6:146":"For those who are Jews, We forbade every animal with undivided hoofs and the fat of oxen and sheep except what is attached to their backs or their intestines or is mixed with their bones. This was the punishment We had inflicted for their wilful disobedience. What We said is true","6:147":"Now if they disbelieve you, say: \"Your Lord is the owner of boundless Mercy; but His scourge cannot be averted from criminal people","6:148":"In response to this the pagans will promptly say: \"If Allah wanted, neither we nor our forefathers would have been pagans, or we could have made anything unlawful.\" That is how their ancestors rejected the truth in the past until they tasted of Our punishment. If they say so, then ask them: \"Do you have any evidence that you can put before us? The fact of the matter is, you believe in nothing but conjecture and follow nothing but falsehood","6:149":"Say: \"In contrast to your position, Allah’s argument is conclusive; if it had been His will He could indeed have guided you all","6:150":"Say: \"Bring your witnesses to prove that Allah did forbid so and so.\" Even if they so testify, do not testify with them, nor yield to the wishes of those who deny Our revelations, disbelieve in the hereafter, and set up others as equals with their Lord","6:151":"O Muhammad, say: \"Come, I will recite what your Lord has forbidden to you: not to commit shirk with Him, to be kind to your parents, not to kill your children making the excuse of inability to support them - We provide sustenance for you and for them not to commit shameful deeds whether open or secret, not to kill any soul forbidden by Allah except for the requirements of justice. These are the things which He enjoined you so that you may learn wisdom","6:152":"Furthermore, not to go near the property of an orphan except in the best way (to improve it), until he attains maturity. Give full measure and just weight - We never charge a soul with more than it can bear. Whenever you speak, be just, even if it affects your own relatives, and fulfill your covenant with Allah. These are the things which He has enjoined on you so that you may be mindful","6:153":"He has also said: Verily this is My way, the Right Way; therefore follow it and do not follow other ways, for they will lead you away from Him. This is what He enjoined on you so that you may guard yourselves against evil","6:154":"Moreover, He said, We gave Moses the Book to complete Our favor on those who would do good to others; it contained details of all things, and was a guide and a mercy, so that they should believe in the ultimate meeting with their Lord","6:155":"We have revealed this Book, similar to the Book given to Moses, as a blessing; therefore, follow it and adopt a Godfearing attitude so that you may receive mercy","6:156":"Lest you say: \"The Book was revealed only to two parties before us and we were unaware of what they read","6:157":"or lest you say: \"If the Book had been revealed to us, we could have followed its guidance better than them,\" a veritable sign has now come to you from your Lord as a guidance and mercy. Who then is more unjust than the one who denies the revelations of Allah and turns away from them? Very soon those who turn away from Our revelations will face dreadful punishment for their aversion","6:158":"Are they waiting for the angels or your Lord to come down to them or are they waiting to be given a certain sign of your Lord! On the Day when that certain sign of your Lord appears, the belief will not profit that soul which did not believe before, or who, while professing to believe did not do good deeds. Say to them: \"Wait if you will; we too are waiting","6:159":"Surely those who divide the religion into sects and identify themselves as a sect, O Muhammad, you have nothing to do with them. Their case will be called to account by Allah Himself, He will inform them as to what they did","6:160":"Whoever does one good deed, he will be given credit for ten similar good deeds, and whoever does one bad deed will be punished for only one, and no one will be treated unjustly","6:161":"O Muhammad, tell them: \"As for me, surely my Lord has guided me to the Right Way, the ever true Deen, the faith of Abraham the upright and he was not of the pagans","6:162":"Also declare: \"Surely my Salah, my devotion, my life, and my death are all for Allah the Lord of the Worlds","6:163":"He has no peer; thus am I commanded and I am the first of the Muslims","6:164":"Say: \"Should I seek another Lord besides Allah when He is the Lord of everything?\" Every soul will reap the fruits of its own deeds; no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.

Our scourge took them all of a sudden at night or while they were taking their afternoon rest","7:5":"and when our scourge fell upon them, their only cry was: \"We have indeed been wrongdoers","7:6":"On the Day of Judgment We shall question those to whom Messengers were sent and We shall also question the Messengers about Our message and its response","7:7":"Then We shall tell their whole story as an eye witness for We were never absent at any time or from any place","7:8":"On that Day, the scale of justice shall be established. Those whose scale of good deeds will be heavy, they are the ones who will attain felicity","7:9":"and those whose scale is light, they shall find themselves in loss for they had done injustice to Our revelations","7:10":"We are the One Who established you on earth, and provided you means of your sustenance therein: yet little it is that you pay thanks","7:11":"Indeed We created you, then We fashioned you, then We asked the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam.\" They all prostrated accordingly except Iblees (Satan) who did not join those who prostrated","7:12":"Allah said: \"What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?\" He replied: \"I am better than he; you created me from fire and him from clay","7:13":"Allah said: \"Get down from here.

Get out, henceforth you are of the petty ones","7:14":"Satan requested: \"Give me respite till the Day of Resurrection","7:15":"Allah said: \"The respite you requested is hereby granted","7:16":"Satan declared: \"Since You let me deviate, now I will lie in ambush for mankind on Your Right Way","7:17":"I Will come upon them from the front, from the rear, from the right, and from the left, and You will not find most of them to be grateful","7:18":"Allah said: \"Get out from here, you despicable outcast; I will certainly fill hell with you and all of them who follow you","7:19":"Allah said: \"O Adam! Dwell with your wife in paradise and eat any fruit you please; but never approach this tree or you shall both become wrongdoers","7:20":"But Satan tempted them so that he might reveal to them the private parts of their bodies which they had never seen before. He told them: \"Your Lord has forbidden you to approach this tree only to prevent you from becoming angels or immortals","7:21":"And he swore to them both: \"I am your sincere adviser","7:22":"Thus he cunningly seduced them, and when they ate from the tree, their shame became visible to them and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden.

We have wronged our souls. If You do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we shall certainly be of the losers","7:24":"Allah said: \"Go down, some of you are the enemy of others. The Earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood for a fixed term","7:25":"He further said: \"Therein you shall live and therein you shall die, and therefrom you shall be raised to life","7:26":"O children of Adam! We have sent down to you clothing to cover your nakedness and as an adornment, however, the best clothing is the clothing of piety. This is one of Allah’s revelations so that the people may learn a lesson","7:27":"O children of Adam! Let not Satan seduce you in the same manner as he seduced your parents out of paradise through stripping them of their clothing in order to expose their nakedness. He and his tribe watch you from where you cannot see them.

You shall return to Him as He created you in the beginning","7:30":"To one group He has guided while the other group deserved to be left in error due to their own choice; for they took the Satans for their protectors instead of Allah, yet they think that they are guided","7:31":"O Children of Adam! Put on your adornment (proper and decent dress) when you attend your Masjid at the time of every prayer. Eat and drink, but do not be extravagant; surely He does not love the extravagant","7:32":"O Muhammad, ask them: \"Who has forbidden you to wear decent clothes or to eat the good food which Allah has provided for His devotees?\" Say: \"All these things are for the enjoyment of the believers in the life of this world though shared by others; but these shall be exclusively theirs on the Day of Resurrection. Thus do We make Our revelations clear for those who understand","7:33":"Say: \"My Lord has forbidden all indecencies whether open or secret, sin and rebellion against justice, committing shirk with Allah for which He has granted no sanction, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge","7:34":"For every nation there is a fixed term, when their term expires, it can neither be delayed for a moment nor can it be made to come early","7:35":"O children of Adam! Whenever there come to you Messengers from among you and recite to you My revelations, those who will become righteous and mend their ways will have nothing to fear or to regret","7:36":"but those who deny Our revelations and treat them with arrogance, shall be the inmates of hellfire to live therein forever","7:37":"Who can be more unjust than the one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His revelations? Such people will have their destined portion from the Book (what was written for them to receive during their life on earth); until when Our messengers (angels of death) arrive to take away their souls, they will ask: \"Where are those gods whom you used to invoke besides Allah?\" They will reply: \"They have forsaken us\" and they will bear witness against themselves (admit) that they were indeed kuffar (unbelievers)","7:38":"Allah will say: \"Enter the fire and join the nations of Jinns and men who have gone before you.\" As each nation will enter hell, it will curse its preceding sister till all are gathered there, the last of them will say about the first one: \"Our Lord! These have led us astray; therefore, give them double punishment of the fire.\" He will answer: \"There will be double for all, although you may not know because of being predecessor or successor in sin and aggression","7:39":"Then the first will say to the last: \"If we were to blame, you too, were no better than us; now taste the punishment of your misdeeds","7:40":"Surely, the gates of the Heaven will not be opened for those who deny Our revelations and treat them with arrogance; their admission into paradise will be as impossible as the passing of a camel through the eye of a needle. That is how We shall reward the criminals","7:41":"Hell shall be their bed and flames shall be their covering. That is how We shall reward the wrongdoers","7:42":"As for those who believe and do good deeds - We never burden a soul with more than it can bear - they are worthy of Paradise, wherein they will live forever","7:43":"We shall remove whatever ill-feeling they may have in their hearts against one another. Rivers will be flowing beneath them; and they will say: \"Praise be to Allah Who guided us this way, we would have never found the Right Way if Allah had not guided us. The Messengers of our Lord have surely preached us the truth.\" At that time they will hear the announcement: \"This is paradise, which you have inherited because of your good deeds","7:44":"The residents of paradise will call out to the inmates of the hellfire: \"We have indeed found out the promises of our Lord to be true. Have you, too, found the promise of your Lord to be true?\" \"Yes,\" they will answer, and a herald will proclaim among them, \"the curse of Allah be upon those wrongdoers","7:45":"who hindered other people from the Way of Allah and sought to make it crooked, and who did not believe in the hereafter","7:46":"Between the two, there shall be a veil, and on the A‘raf (heights) there will be people who will recognize them by their features. They will call out to the residents of Paradise: \"Peace be upon you!\" They will not have yet entered it, though they will have the hope","7:47":"When their eyes shall turn towards the inmates of the hellfire they will say: \"Our Lord! Do not cast us among these wrongdoers","7:48":"The people of the A'raf (heights) will call to certain men (famous personalities from among the inmates of Hell) whom they will recognize by their features and say: \"Have you found out that neither your riches nor your arrogant pride have availed you","7:49":"Are the residents of paradise not the same people about whom you swore that Allah will never bestow His mercy on them?\" Today the same people are being welcomed with the words, \"Enter paradise, you have nothing to fear or to regret","7:50":"Then the inmates of the fire will cry out to the residents of paradise: \"Give us some water or some of the food which Allah has provided you.\" They will reply: \"Allah has prohibited both of these things to the unbelievers","7:51":"who took their religion to be mere amusement and play and were deceived by their earthly life.\" Allah will say: \"Today We will forget them as they forgot the meeting of this Day; and mocked at Our revelations","7:52":"For We have certainly brought them a Book which provides clear details based on knowledge and which is a guidance and blessing for the true believers","7:53":"Now are these people waiting for anything other than the Day of Fulfillment (Day of Judgment)? When the Day of Fulfillment will come, those who have disregarded it, will say: \"Indeed the Messengers of our Lord had come with the truth. Are there any intercessors now, who could intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back so that we would not do as we have done before.\" In fact they would have lost their souls and the things they had invented will leave them in the lurch","7:54":"Surely your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Yõme (time periods) and is firmly established on the throne of authority. He makes the night cover the day and the day follow the night automatically. He created the sun, the moon and the stars, and made them subservient to His will. Take note: His is the creation, and His is the command. Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the worlds","7:55":"Call on your Lord with humility and in private; for He does not love the transgressors","7:56":"Do not create mischief in the land after it has been set in order. Pray to Him with fear and hope. Surely the mercy of Allah is always close to those who do good to others","7:57":"He is the One Who sends the winds bearing good news of His blessings, so when they lift up heavy clouds, We drive them along to a dead countryside and make the rain fall upon it and bring forth all kinds of fruits from the same dead land. Likewise We will raise the dead to life; this example is given so that you may learn a lesson from this observation","7:58":"The good soil yields rich produce by the permission of Allah and barren soil yields nothing but poor produce. Thus do We explain Our revelations over and over again for those who pay thanks","7:59":"Indeed We selected Noah for the guidance of his people, and he said: \"O my people! Worship Allah, you have no god but Him. If you do not listen to what I say, I fear for you the punishment of a Mighty Day","7:60":"The chiefs of his nation said: \"Surely we see that you are in evident error","7:61":"He replied: \"O my people! I am not in error; on the contrary, I am a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds","7:62":"I am appointed to deliver the message of my Lord and give you friendly advice for I know from Allah something that you do not know","7:63":"Do you wonder that there has come to you a message from your Lord through a man from among yourselves to warn you, so that you may fear Allah in order to receive His mercy","7:64":"But they denied him, as a result We saved him and all who were with him in the ark, and drowned those who denied Our revelations. Surely they were a blind nation","7:65":"For the people of ‘Ad We selected their brother Hud, who said: \"O my people! Worship Allah! You have no god but Him. Will you not fear Him","7:66":"The chiefs of his nation who denied his message said: \"We can see that you are crazy and we think that you are lying","7:67":"He replied: \"O my people! I am not crazy, on the contrary I am a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds","7:68":"I am conveying the message of my Lord to you, and I am an honest adviser to you","7:69":"Do you wonder that a reminder from your Lord has come to you through one of your own men to warn you? Remember that He made you successors after the people of Noah and gave you a tall stature as compared to other people. Therefore, remember the favors that you have received from Allah, so that you may prosper","7:70":"They replied: \"Have you come to us with the demand that we should worship Allah Alone and give up those whom our forefathers used to worship? Well, bring us what you are threatening us with if what you say is true","7:71":"Hud said: \"You have already incurred the blight and wrath of your Lord. Would you dispute with me about mere names which you and your forefathers have invented, and for which Allah has revealed no sanction? If so then wait for the decision of Allah, I too will wait with you","7:72":"We saved him and his companions by Our mercy and We cut off the roots of (annihilated) those who denied Our revelations and did not become believers","7:73":"For the people of Thamud We selected their brother Saleh, who said: \"O my people! Worship Allah; you have no other god but Him. Now a clear proof has come to you from your Lord; here is Allah's she-camel as a sign for you, therefore leave her alone to pasture on Allah’s land and do not touch her with bad intentions, lest you incur a painful punishment","7:74":"Remember how you were made the heirs of ‘Ad and settled in the land, capable of building mansions in the valleys and carving out homes in the mountains. Therefore, remember the favors of Allah and do not spread mischief in the land","7:75":"The arrogant leaders from his nation asked the oppressed among them who have believed: \"Do you really believe that Saleh is a Messenger from his Lord?\" They replied: \"We do indeed believe in the revelation with which he has been sent","7:76":"The arrogant, who considered themselves superior, said: \"We deny all that you believe in","7:77":"Then they hamstrung the she-camel, defied the commandment of their Lord and challenged Saleh saying: \"Bring down the scourge you have threatened us with, if you truly are one of the Messengers","7:78":"Thereupon an earthquake overtook them and they became lifeless bodies in their homes with their faces down","7:79":"Saleh left them saying: \"O my people! I did indeed convey to you the message of my Lord and gave you good advice but you did not love the good advisers","7:80":"We also selected Lot, who said to his people: \"Will you do such indecent acts as no one else in the world has committed before you","7:81":"You satisfy your lust with men (homosexual) instead of women. Indeed you are a nation who has transgressed beyond bounds","7:82":"His people had no answer but to say: \"Drive them out of your town, they pose to be very pious","7:83":"So We saved him and his family except his wife, who was of those who lagged behind","7:84":"We let loose rain of brimstone and every one of them was killed; see what was the outcome for such criminals","7:85":"For Madyan We selected their brother Shu‘aib, who said: \"O my people! Worship Allah, you have no other god but Him. A clear guidance has come to you from your Lord. Give just measure and weight, do not undersell others in their goods, and do not create mischief in the land after it has been set in order; this is better for you if you are true believers","7:86":"Do not sit in ambush on every road to threaten people and hinder from the Way of Allah those who believe in Him, seeking to make His Way crooked. Remember how He multiplied you when you were a few in number and see what was the end of the mischief-makers of prior nations","7:87":"If there are some among you who believe in the message with which I have been sent and others who disbelieve it, then be patient until Allah judges between us, for He is the best of all judges","7:88":"The arrogant proud leaders of his nation said: \"O Shu‘aib! We shall certainly drive you and your fellow believers out of our town or you will have to return back to our national ways.\" He replied: \"What! Will you make us turn back against our will","7:89":"We shall indeed invent a lie against Allah if we return to your ways after Allah has rescued us therefrom. It is not possible for us to turn back unless Allah, our Lord, want us to. Our Lord has vast knowledge of everything. We put our trust in Allah.\" Then they prayed: \"Our Lord! Decide between us and our nation with truth, for you are the best to decide","7:90":"The leaders who disbelieved from among his nation said: \"If you follow Shu`aib, you shall indeed be losers","7:91":"Thereupon an earthquake overtook them and they became lifeless bodies in their homes with their faces down","7:92":"Those who called Shu`aib a liar were as though they never lived therein; those who called Shu`aib a liar were the actual losers","7:93":"Shu`aib left them saying: \"O my people! I did indeed convey to you the messages of my Lord and I did give you good advice; how shall I then be sorry for the nation that refuses to believe","7:94":"Whenever We sent a Prophet to a town We afflicted its people with adversity and misfortunes so that they might humble themselves","7:95":"Then We changed their adversity into good fortune till they became very affluent and said: \"Our forefathers also had their adversity and affluence.\" Behold! We took them by surprise while they did not even notice it","7:96":"Had the residents of the towns believed and feared Allah, We would have showered upon them riches from the heavens and the earth, but they disbelieved; so We seized them for their misdeeds","7:97":"Do the people of these towns now feel secure from Our punishment coming to them by night while they might be fast asleep","7:98":"Or do the people of these towns feel secure from Our punishment coming to them in broad daylight while they are playing around","7:99":"Do these people feel secure against the plan of Allah? In fact, only those people feel secure from the plan of Allah who are doomed to destruction","7:100":"Is it not a guiding lesson to those who inherit the earth after its former occupants, that if We please, We can punish them for their sins and seal their hearts so they would not hear","7:101":"Those towns whose stories We related to you, can serve as examples. Certainly their Messengers came to them with clear signs, but they persisted in their unbelief and would not believe what they had denied before. That’s why Allah sealed the hearts of those unbelievers","7:102":"We did not find most of them true to their commitments, rather We found that most of them were transgressors","7:103":"Then after them, We sent Moses with Our revelations to Pharoah (Pharaoh) and his chiefs but they too treated Our revelations unjustly, so see what was the end of those mischief-makers","7:104":"Moses said: \"O Pharoah! I am a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds","7:105":"It is not befitting for me to say anything about Allah except the Truth. I have come to you from your Lord with clear signs of appointment, therefore, send the children of Israel with me","7:106":"Pharoah asked: \"If you have come with a sign then produce it, if what you say is true","7:107":"So Moses threw down his staff and all of a sudden it became a real serpent","7:108":"Then he drew out his hand from his pocket and it became shining white to all the beholders","7:109":"The chiefs of Pharoah’s nation said: \"He indeed is a skilled sorcerer","7:110":"who intends to drive you out from your land.\" Pharoah asked: \"So what do you propose","7:111":"They said: \"Put him and his brother off for a while; and send the collectors to all the cities","7:112":"and summon every skillful sorcerer to you","7:113":"The sorcerers came to Pharoah and said: \"We must certainly have some suitable reward if we prevail","7:114":"Yes, he answered. \"Not only reward but more: you shall certainly become my favored friends","7:115":"Then they asked Moses: \"Will you cast, or should we be the first ones to cast","7:116":"Moses said: \"You cast.\" So when they cast, they bewitched the eyes of the people and terrified them by a display of a mighty sorcery","7:117":"We inspired Moses to cast his staff. No sooner did he cast his staff than it became a serpent and began to swallow up the creation of their sorcery","7:118":"Thus the truth prevailed and all that they did collapsed","7:119":"Pharoah and his people were defeated and put to humiliation","7:120":"and the sorcerers, since they were professionals and knew that it was not sorcery, fell down in prostration","7:121":"saying: \"we believe in the Lord of the worlds","7:122":"the Lord of Moses and Haroon","7:123":"Pharoah said: \"How dare you believe in Him without my permission? In fact this was a plot which you all had planned to drive the people out of their city, but soon you will know its consequences","7:124":"I will have your hands and your feet cut off on opposite sides and then crucify you all","7:125":"They answered: \"We will surely return to our Lord","7:126":"Look at your verdict, you want to take revenge simply because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came before us! O Lord! Give us patience and cause us die as Muslims","7:127":"The chiefs of Pharoah’s (Pharaoh's) nation asked him: \"Will you leave Moses and his nation free to commit mischief in the land and to forsake you and your gods?\" He said: \"We will put their sons to death and spare their daughters; we have irresistible power over them","7:128":"Moses said to his people: \"Seek help from Allah and be patient. The land belongs to Allah. He gives it as a heritage to those of His devotees whom He pleases. You should know that final success is for the righteous","7:129":"They said: \"We were oppressed before you came to us and since you have come to us.\" He replied: \"It is quite possible that your Lord may destroy your enemy and make you vicegerent in the land; then He will see how you act","7:130":"We afflicted Pharoah’s people with several years of famine and shortages of fruit so that they might come to their senses","7:131":"But whenever they had good times they said \"It is our due,\" and whenever evil befell them, they ascribed that bad luck to Moses and those with him. Behold! In fact their misfortune was in the hands of Allah; yet most of them do not know","7:132":"They said to Moses: \"No matter what sign you may bring us to put your magic spell, we are not going to believe you","7:133":"So We plagued them with storms, locusts, lice, frogs and blood: clear cut signs, yet they persisted in their arrogance, for they were a criminal nation","7:134":"Every time the plague befell them, they said: \"O Moses! Pray for us to your Lord as He has made the promise with you, if you help remove the plague from us, we shall truly believe in you and send the Children of Israel with you","7:135":"But every time We removed the plague from them and the appointed time for the release of the Children of Israel came, lo! They broke their promise","7:136":"Therefore, We inflicted retribution on them and drowned them in the sea, for they denied Our signs and became heedless of them","7:137":"Thus We made that nation which was oppressed, the inheritors of the eastern and western lands which We had blessed. That’s how the fair promise of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because they had endured with patience; and We levelled to the ground the great works and fine buildings which Pharoah and his nation had erected with such pride","7:138":"We made the Children of Israel cross the (Red) sea. On their way they came across a people who were worshipping their idols. They said: \"O Moses fashion for us an Ilah (a god for worship) like the gods of these people.\" He replied: \"You are indeed very ignorant people","7:139":"don’t you realize, what these people are following is doomed to destruction and their deeds are in vain","7:140":"He further said: \"Should I seek for you a god for worship other than Allah: when it is He who has exalted you above all the worlds","7:141":"and while Allah says, \"Remember that We rescued you from people of Pharaoh, who subjected you to cruel torment, putting your sons to death and sparing your women and in that condition of slavery there was a great trial from your Lord","7:142":"We summoned Moses to the mount of Tur for thirty nights and added ten more to complete the term of forty nights for communion with his Lord. (Before leaving) Moses asked his brother Haroon (Aaron): \"You will be in my place among my people, set a good example and do not follow the way of mischief-makers","7:143":"When Moses came to Our appointed place and his Lord spoke to him, he asked: \"O my Lord! Give me power of sight to see You.\" He answered: \"You cannot see Me. Look at the mountain; if it remains firm in its place then soon you might be able to see Me\". When his Lord manifested His glory on the mountain, it turned into small pieces of fine dust and Moses fell down unconscious. When Moses recovered he said: \"Glory be to You! Accept my repentance and I am the first of the believers","7:144":"Allah said: \"O Moses! I have chosen you from among mankind to deliver My message and to have conversation with Me: so take what I give you and be thankful","7:145":"We inscribed for him upon tablets all kind of instructions and details of every thing, concerning all branches of life, and said: \"Observe these with firmness and enjoin your people to follow them according to the best of their abilities. Soon I shall show you the homes of the transgressors","7:146":"I will turn away from My signs the eyes of those who are unjustly arrogant in the land, so that even if they see each and every sign they will not believe in it. If they see the Right Way before them they will not follow it; but if they see a crooked way they will follow it; this is because they denied Our revelations and were heedless of them","7:147":"Those who deny Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter, their deeds are null. Should they be rewarded except for what they have done","7:148":"In his absence the nation of Moses made an image of a calf for worship from their jewelry which produced a mooing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor give them the guidance? Yet they took it for worship and became wrongdoers","7:149":"When they felt ashamed about what they had done and realized that they had gone astray, they said: \"If our Lord does not have mercy on us and pardon us, we shall become losers","7:150":"When Moses came back to his people, he was extremely angry and sorrowful, and he said: \"What an evil thing you have done in my place in my absence! Have you tried to hasten the retribution of your Lord?\" He put down the Holy Tablets and seized his brother by the hair of his head and dragged him closer. Haroon (Aaron) cried: \"O son of my mother! The people overpowered me and almost killed me; do not make my enemies happy over me and do not count me among the wrongdoers","7:151":"At this Moses said: \"O Lord! Forgive me and my brother! And admit us to Your mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of all","7:152":"Those who worshipped the calf have indeed incurred the wrath of their Lord and disgrace in this life; thus do We recompense those who invent falsehoods","7:153":"As for those who do evil deeds, then repent and become true believers thereafter, your Lord is most surely the Forgiving, Merciful","7:154":"When Moses’s anger calmed down he took up the Holy Tablets in whose writing there was guidance and mercy for those that fear their Lord","7:155":"Moses chose seventy men from his nation to accompany him to Our place of meeting. On their way when they were seized by a violent earthquake, he prayed: \"O my Lord! Had it been Your will, You could have destroyed them long ago, and myself too. Would You destroy us for the offense committed by some fools among us? That trial was ordained by You, to confound whom You willed and to guide whom You pleased. You are our Guardian, therefore, forgive us and have mercy on us; for You are the best of all forgivers","7:156":"O Allah ordain for us what is good in this life and in the Hereafter, surely we have turned to You.\" He replied: \"I will inflict My punishment upon whom I please; yet My mercy encompasses everything. I will ordain special mercy for those who do righteous deeds, pay Zakah and believe in Our revelations","7:157":"Now, special mercy is assigned to those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet (Muhammad) - whom they shall find described in the Torah and the Gospel. Who enjoins them what is good and forbids what is evil; makes pure things Halal (lawful) for them and impure things Haram (unlawful); relieves them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that were around their necks. Therefore, those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the Light which is sent down with him, will be the ones who will be successful in this life and the hereafter","7:158":"O Muhammad, say: \"O mankind! I am the Messenger of Allah towards all of you from He to whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no deity but Him. He brings to life and causes to die. Therefore, believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet (Muhammad) who believes in Allah and His Word. Follow him so that you may be rightly guided","7:159":"In the nation of Moses there were some who guided others with the truth and thereby established justice","7:160":"We divided them into twelve tribes, as nations; and when his thirsty people asked him for water, We revealed to Moses: \"Strike the rock with your staff.\" Thereupon twelve springs gushed out from the rock, each tribe was specified its drinking place. We caused the clouds to cast shadow over them and sent down to them manna and salva for their food, saying: \"Eat of the pure things We have provided for you,\" but they rebelled and by doing so they did not harm Us but they did injustice to their own souls","7:161":"When it was said to them: \"Reside in this town and eat therein whatever you please and say ‘Hittatun’ (forgive us) and enter the gate in a posture of humility; We will forgive you your sins and increase all the more the reward for such righteous people","7:162":"But the wicked among them changed that word which was said to them, as a result We sent down a scourge upon them from heaven for their wrong doings","7:163":"Ask them, about the town which was situated on the sea shore, what happened when they transgressed in the matter of Sabbath. On the day of their Sabbath the fish appeared before them on the surface of the water but on the days other than their Sabbath they never came near them; thus did We tempt them because they transgressed","7:164":"Also remind them about the conversation among some of them, when some of them asked: \"Why do you admonish a people whom Allah will destroy or sternly punish?\" They replied: \"To be able to offer an excuse before our Lord that we did discharge our duty, and also in the hope that they may refrain from His disobedience","7:165":"However, when they disregarded the reminder, We delivered those who forbade evil and We overtook those who were wrongdoers with stern punishment because of their transgression","7:166":"But when after that they persisted in their forbidden ways, We said to them: \"Be detested apes","7:167":"Also remind them when your Lord declared that He would raise against them others who would afflict them with grievous torment till the Day of Resurrection. Swift is the retribution of your Lord, yet He is also the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful","7:168":"We broke their unity as a nation and dispersed them into different communities all over the earth - some of them are righteous and others are the opposite - We tested them with both blessings and misfortunes so that they might turn to the Right Way","7:169":"Then they were succeeded by an evil generation who inherited the Book; they indulged in the vanities of this nether life, saying: \"We expect to be forgiven\" assuming that they are favorites of Allah and somehow He will spare them. Yet if similar vanities come their way they would again seize them. Was not a covenant taken from them in the Book that they would not speak anything about Allah except the truth? And they have studied what is in the Book. Best for the righteous is the home of the hereafter, don’t you understand","7:170":"As for those who strictly observe the Book and establish Salah, surely We never let the reward of such righteous people go waste","7:171":"Remember when We suspended the mountain over them as though it was an umbrella and they feared it was going to fall on them and We said: \"Hold firmly to the Book that We have given you and be mindful of what is in it, so that you may guard yourselves against evil","7:172":"O Prophet, remind mankind about the incident when your Lord brought into existence the offspring from the loins of Adam and his descendants (virtually each single individual of mankind) and made them testify about themselves. Allah asked them: \"Am I not your Lord?\" They all replied: \"Yes! We bear witness that You are.\" This We did, lest you mankind should say on the Day of Resurrection: \"We were not aware of this fact that You are our Lord and that there will be a Day of Judgment","7:173":"or lest you should say: \"Our forefathers started the practice of shirk and we just followed, being their descendants. Will you then destroy us on account of following the sin committed by those wrongdoers","7:174":"Thus do We spell out Our revelations so that you might return to the Right Way","7:175":"Tell them the story of that person to whom We sent our revelations but he turned away from them, as a result Satan persuaded him until he become one of the misguided","7:176":"Had it been Our will, We would have exalted him through those revelations; but he clung to this earthly life and followed his own desires. His similitude is that of a dog: if you chase him he lolls out his tongue and if you leave him alone he still lolls out his tongue. Such are those who deny Our revelations, tell them these parables, so that they might think over their behavior to Our revelations","7:177":"Very bad is the example of those people who deny Our revelations and wrong their own souls","7:178":"Only he whom Allah guides is rightly guided; and whom He confounds will become the losers","7:179":"Certainly, We have destined many Jinns and human beings for hell; those are the ones who have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, they have ears with which they do not hear. They are like animals - or even worse than them , because they are those who are heedless","7:180":"Allah has the most excellent names (over ninety-nine attributes); call on Him by them ; and shun those people who use profanity in His Names, such people shall be requited for their misdeeds","7:181":"Among those whom We have created, there are some people who guide others with the truth and establish justice therewith","7:182":"Those who deny Our revelations, We draw them step by step closer to destruction in ways that they do not realize","7:183":"and even though I grant them respite; My plan is surely effective","7:184":"Has it never occurred to them that their companion is not a madman; he is merely a plain Warner","7:185":"Have they not pondered over the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever Allah has created, and that maybe their hour of death has come closer? In what message after this would they then believe","7:186":"None can guide those whom Allah confounds and leaves them blundering about in their rebellious transgression","7:187":"They ask you about the Hour of Doom and when will it take place. Say: \"Knowledge about it rests only with my Lord: He Himself will disclose it at the proper time. Heavy is its weight in the heavens and the earth. It will not come gradually but all of a sudden. They ask you as if you yourself were in search of it. Tell them: \"The knowledge about it rests only with Allah though most people do not understand","7:188":"Further tell them: \"I have no power to acquire benefit or avert any harm from myself, only that happens which Allah wants. Had I possessed the knowledge of the unseen, I would have acquired many benefits to myself; and no harm would have touched me. I am no more than a Warner and bearer of good news for the true believers","7:189":"He is the one who created you from a single being and from that being He created his mate, so that he might find comfort with her. When he covers her, she conceives a light burden and walks around with it. When it grows heavy they both pray to Allah their Lord saying: \"If You will grant us a healthy child, we will be truly thankful","7:190":"But when He gives them a healthy child, they both begin to associate partners with Him in what He has given them; but Allah is exalted far above the shirk they commit of associating other deities with Him as His partners","7:191":"Do they associate with Him those deities who can create nothing but are themselves created","7:192":"they have neither the ability to help them, nor can they help themselves","7:193":"If you invite them to guidance they will not follow you. It will be all the same for you whether you call them or hold your peace","7:194":"In fact those whom you call besides Allah are bondmen, like yourselves. Well call them, and let them answer you, if what you say is true","7:195":"Have they feet to walk with? Have they hands to hold with? Have they eyes to see with? Have they ears to hear with? O Muhammad, say: \"Call on your shoraka' (partners you have set up besides Allah) and collectively plot against me and give me no respite","7:196":"My protector is Allah Who has revealed this Book and He is the protecting friend of the righteous","7:197":"On the contrary, those whom you call besides Him have neither the ability to help you, nor can they help themselves","7:198":"If you call them to guidance, they cannot even hear what you say, although it appears as if they are looking at you, they do not see","7:199":"Show forgiveness, speak for justice and avoid the ignorant","7:200":"If Satan tempts you, seek refuge with Allah; for He is the one Who is All Hearing, Knowing","7:201":"Those who fear Allah, when they are tempted by Satan, they have but to remember Allah and they shall see the light (right course of action)","7:202":"As for Satan’s brothers, they drag them deeper into error and never relax their efforts","7:203":"When you, O Muhammad, do not bring them a revelation, they say: \"Have you not yet invented?\" Tell them: \"I follow only what is revealed to me from my Lord. This Book contains veritable insight from your Lord, a guidance and blessing for the true believers","7:204":"When the Qur’an is recited, listen to it with complete silence so that you may be shown mercy","7:205":"Bring your Lord to remembrance deep in your soul with humility and in reverence without raising your voice, both in the mornings and in the evenings; and be not of those who are heedless","7:206":"Surely those who are close to your Lord do not feel too proud to worship Him; they declare His glory and prostrate themselves before Him","8:1":"They ask you about booty (spoils of war). Tell them: \"The Booty belongs to Allah and His Messenger: so fear Allah, end your disputes, and correct the relations among yourselves: obey Allah and His Messenger if you are true believers","8:2":"The true believers are those whose hearts tremble with fear, when the name of Allah is mentioned, and whose faith grows stronger as they listen to His revelations and they put their trust in their Lord","8:3":"who establish Salah and spend in charity out of the sustenance which We have given them","8:4":"They are the ones who are the true believers; they will have exalted ranks with their Lord, forgiveness for their sins, and honorable sustenance","8:5":"Your Lord ordered you to leave your home to fight for justice, but some of the believers were reluctant","8:6":"They argued with you about the truth which had been made clear, as if they were being driven to death with their eyes wide open","8:7":"Remember, Allah promised you victory over one of the two enemy parties and you wished for the one which was unarmed but Allah intended to prove the truth to be true according to His words and to cut off the roots of the unbelievers","8:8":"so that truth should come out as truth and falsehood should be proved as false, even though the criminals wished otherwise","8:9":"When you prayed to your Lord for help, He answered: \"I will assist you with one thousand angels, one after another","8:10":"By this good news, Allah sought to comfort your heart, for victory comes only from Allah; surely Allah is Mighty, Wise","8:11":"Remember (before the battle of Badr) when He caused drowsiness to overcome you as an assurance from Himself, and sent down water from the sky to cleanse you and to remove from you the uncleanliness caused by Satan, to strengthen your hearts and to steady your feet therewith","8:12":"Then your Lord revealed His will to the angels: \"I am with you, give courage to the believers. I will cast panic into the hearts of the unbelievers, therefore, smite their necks and beat every joint of their bodies","8:13":"This is because they defied Allah and His Messenger. Whoever defies Allah and His Messenger should know that Allah is strict in retribution","8:14":"that it is the reality, so taste it, and there will also be the torture of hellfire for the unbelievers","8:15":"O believers! When you encounter the unbelievers in a battle, never turn your backs to them","8:16":"and whoever turns his back to them on such an occasion - unless it be a strategy of war, or to join towards a detachment - shall incur the wrath of Allah and his abode shall be hell, and how awful shall be that dwelling","8:17":"In fact, it was not you who killed them, but it was Allah Who killed them; it was not you who threw the handful of sand, but it was Allah Who threw it so that He might pass the believers successfully through this excellent trial; surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing","8:18":"This is His dealing with you: as for the unbelievers, Allah will surely frustrate their evil plots","8:19":"O unbelievers! You wanted a decision; lo! The decision, in shape of the believers' victory, has come to you. Now if you desist, it will be better for you, and if you repeat your act of war against the believers, so shall We repeat the act of providing them assistance, and your forces, however large in number they may be, shall avail you nothing, for verily Allah is with the believers","8:20":"O believers! Obey Allah and his Messenger and do not turn your back to him, now that you have heard all","8:21":"Do not be like those who say: \"We hear,\" but give no heed to what they hear","8:22":"For the worst animals in the sight of Allah are those deaf and dumb people who do not use common sense","8:23":"Had Allah perceived any virtue in them He would have indeed endowed them with hearing. Had he made them (those without virtue) hear, they would have turned away and refused to listen","8:24":"O believers! Respond to the call of Allah and His Messenger, when He calls you to that which gives you life; and know that Allah stands between man and his heart, and that it is He in Whose presence you shall all be assembled","8:25":"Guard yourselves against temptation. The wrongdoers among you are not the only ones who will be tempted; and know that Allah is strict in retribution","8:26":"Call to mind how He gave you shelter when you were a few in number and were oppressed in the land, ever fearing lest the enemy would kidnap you. He made you strong with His help and provided you a safe asylum and gave you pure things for sustenance so that you may give thanks","8:27":"O believers! Do not betray the trust of Allah and His Messenger, nor violate your trusts knowingly","8:28":"You should know that your wealth and your children are, in fact, a test for you, and that Allah is He with Whom is your mighty reward","8:29":"O believers! If you fear Allah He will grant you a criterion (to judge between right and wrong), do away with your sins and forgive you. Allah is the Lord of Mighty Grace","8:30":"Remember, how the unbelievers plotted against you. They sought to take you captive or kill you or exile you. They planned - and Allah also planned - Allah is the best planner of all","8:31":"Whenever Our revelations are recited to them they say: \"Well, we have heard this. If we wanted we could fabricate the like. These are nothing but the tales of the ancients","8:32":"Also remember how they said: \"O Allah! If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky or inflict some dreadful scourge to punish us","8:33":"But Allah would not punish them while you were present in their midst. Nor does Allah punish people while they are asking His forgiveness","8:34":"But now there is no reason why Allah should not punish them when they are blocking others from the Masjid-al-Haram (Ka'bah), whereas they are not its lawful guardians. In fact, its only guardians are those who fear Allah, even though most of them do not understand","8:35":"Their prayer at the House of Allah is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands: whose only answer can be, \"Taste the punishment because of your denying the truth","8:36":"Surely the unbelievers spend their wealth in blocking the way of Allah and so will they continue to spend; but in the end these very efforts will become the cause of their regrets; at length they will be defeated, and in the hereafter these unbelievers will be gathered together and driven to hell","8:37":"in order that Allah may separate the filthy from the pure. He will heap the filthy one upon another, altogether, and then cast them into hell. They are the ones who will be the losers","8:38":"O Prophet, tell the unbelievers that if they desist from unbelief, their past shall be forgiven; but if they persist in sin, let them reflect upon the fate of their forefathers","8:39":"O believers, fight them until there is no more mischief and the Deen of Allah (way of life prescribed by Allah) is established completely; but if they do stop from mischief, then surely Allah is observant of all their actions","8:40":"If they give no heed, then you should know that Allah is your protector. He is the best to protect and the best to help","8:41":"Know that one-fifth of the booty (spoils of war) is for Allah, His Messenger, close relatives of the Messenger, orphans, the needy and the wayfarer, if you do believe in Allah and in what We revealed to Our servant on the day of distinction (between right and wrong), the day when two armies met in combat. Allah has power over everything","8:42":"Remember when you were on this side of the valley and they on the farther side, and the caravan was on lower ground than you both. If you had made a mutual appointment to fight, you would have certainly failed; but Allah sought to accomplish what He has ordained, that those who were destined to perish might die by clear proof and those who were destined to live might survive by clear proof. Surely, Allah is He Who hears all and knows all","8:43":"Also remember that Allah made them appear in your dream as few in number; if He had shown them to you as many in number, you would surely have been discouraged and you would have disputed in your decision. But Allah saved you; surely He knows the very secrets of the hearts","8:44":"And remember when you met them in the encounter, He showed them to you as few in number in your eyes and He made you appear as a few in number in their eyes so that Allah might accomplish what He had ordained: for ultimately all affairs return to Allah for decision","8:45":"O believers! When you encounter an enemy in a combat, be firm and frequently remember Allah so that you may be successful","8:46":"Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not argue with one another, lest you lose courage and weaken your strength. Show patience, surely Allah is on the side of the patient","8:47":"Do not be like those who started from their homes recklessly in order to be seen by everybody and debar others from the Way of Allah. Allah encompasses all their actions","8:48":"Remember when Satan made their actions seem attractive to them, and said: \"No one from mankind can overcome you today, for I will be at hand to help you.\" Yet when the two armies came within sight of each other he turned upon his heels saying: \" I am done with you, for I can see what you cannot. I fear Allah, for Allah is severe in punishment","8:49":"At that time the hypocrites and all those who had malice in their hearts were saying: \"Their religion has deceived them.\" But you should know that anyone who puts his trust in Allah will find Allah Mighty, Wise","8:50":"If you could only see the angels when they were taking away the souls of the killed unbelievers! They were smiting their faces and their backs saying: \"Taste the torment of the conflagration","8:51":"This is the punishment for what your hands have sent forth, for Allah is never unjust to His servants","8:52":"This was the same that happened to the people of Pharaoh and to those that had gone before them. They also rejected the revelations of Allah and Allah seized them for their sins. Surely Allah is Mighty and severe in punishment","8:53":"That is because Allah has never changed the blessings which He has bestowed on a people until they themselves changed the condition of their souls; verily Allah hears all and knows all","8:54":"This same principle was applied to the people of Pharoah and those who have gone before them, they rejected the revelations of their Lord so We destroyed them for their sins, and We drowned the people of Pharoah; they were all wrongdoers","8:55":"The worst of animals in the sight of Allah are those who reject the truth and do not become believers","8:56":"Those who make treaties with you and time after time violate their treaties, and have no fear of Allah","8:57":"If you encounter them in combat, make them a fearsome example for others who would follow them so that they all may learn a lesson","8:58":"If you fear treachery from any of your allies, you may fairly retaliate by breaking off the treaty with them (through properly notifying them to that effect), for Allah does not love the treacherous","8:59":"Let not the unbelievers think that they have won the game; surely they can never frustrate the believers","8:60":"Muster against them all the military strength and cavalry that you can afford so that you may strike terror into the hearts of your enemy and the enemy of Allah, and others besides them who are unknown to you but known to Allah. Remember that whatever you will spend in the cause of Allah, shall be paid back to you in full and you shall not be treated unjustly","8:61":"If the enemy is inclined towards peace, do make peace with them, and put your trust in Allah. He is the One Who hears all , knows all","8:62":"Should they intend to deceive you, verily Allah is All- Sufficient for you. He is the One Who has strengthened you and the believers with His help","8:63":"through putting affection in their hearts. If you had spent all that is in the earth, you could not have so united their hearts; but Allah has united them. He is Mighty, Wise","8:64":"O Prophet! Allah is all-sufficient for you and for the believers who follow you","8:65":"O Prophet! Rouse the believers to prepare for combat. If there are twenty steadfast among you, they shall vanquish two hundred: if there are one hundred they shall overcome one thousand of the unbelievers, for they are a people who lack understanding","8:66":"For now Allah is lightening your burden, because He knows that there are still some weak individuals among you, so if there are one hundred steadfast among you, they shall vanquish two hundred and if there be one thousand, they will overcome two thousand with the leave of Allah, for Allah is with those who are steadfast","8:67":"It is not fit for a Prophet that he should take prisoners of war until he has thoroughly subdued the land. Do you, O followers of Muhammad, desire the temporal goods of this world, while Allah desires for you the hereafter? Allah is Mighty, Wise","8:68":"Had there not been a previous sanction from Allah to take ransom, you should have been sternly punished for what you have taken","8:69":"Very well, enjoy the booty which you have taken, for it is lawful and pure, but in the future fear Allah. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","8:70":"O Prophet! Tell the captives in your custody: \"If Allah finds goodness in your hearts He will give you even better than what has been taken from you, as well as forgive you. Allah Is Forgiving, Merciful","8:71":"But if they have treacherous designs against you, O Prophet, they have already shown treason against Allah. That is why He made them your captives. Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise","8:72":"Those who believed (embraced Islam), migrated and made Jihad (exerted their utmost struggle) with their wealth and their persons in the cause of Allah; as well as those who gave them asylum and help, are indeed the protecting friends of one another. As to those who believed (embraced Islam) but did not emigrate (to Dar-ul- Islam, the Islamic State), you are under no obligation to protect them until they emigrate; yet it is your obligation to help them in the matters of faith if they ask for your help, except against a people with whom you have a treaty. Allah is observant of all your actions","8:73":"The unbelievers are protectors of one of another. If you fail to do likewise, there will be disorder in the land and great corruption","8:74":"Those who believed (embraced Islam), migrated and made Jihad (exerted their utmost struggle) in the cause of Allah, and those who gave them asylum and help - they are the true believers. They shall have forgiveness and honorable provisions","8:75":"Those who believed (embraced Islam) afterwards, migrated and joined you in Jihad - they too are your brothers, although according to the Book of Allah the blood relatives have greater rights on one other. Indeed Allah knows everything","9:1":"A declaration of immunity from Allah and His Messenger is hereby made to those of the pagans with whom you have made a treaty","9:2":"You have four months to go around in the land unmolested; but you should know that you cannot frustrate the will of Allah, and that Allah will humiliate the unbelievers","9:3":"This is a public proclamation from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the day of the Great Hajj (Pilgrimage) that Allah and His Messenger do hereby dissolve treaty obligations with the pagans. Therefore, if you repent, it will be better for you but if you turn away, then you should know that you cannot frustrate the Will of Allah. O Prophet, proclaim a painful punishment to those who are unbelievers","9:4":"Except (this proclamation does not apply to) those pagans who honored their treaties with you in every detail and aided none against you. So fulfill your treaties with them to the end of their term; for Allah loves the righteous","9:5":"When the forbidden months (10,11,12 & 1 of the Islamic calendar) are over, then fight the pagans wherever you find them, seize them, besiege them, and lie in ambush for them in every stratagem of war, but if they repent, establish Salah and pay Zakah, then let them go their way: surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","9:6":"If anyone from the pagans ask you for asylum, grant it to him so that he may hear the Word of Allah, and then escort him to his place of safety: this should be done because these people do not know the truth","9:7":"How can there be a treaty with the pagans on the part of Allah and His Messenger except for those with whom you ratified a treaty at the Masjid-al-Haram? So long as they honor it, you also honor: for Allah loves the righteous","9:8":"How can you trust them? If they prevail against you, they respect neither treaty nor ties of relationship. They just flatter you with their tongues, but their hearts reject you, and most of them are transgressors","9:9":"They have sold the revelations of Allah for paltry worldly gain and they have hindered others from His way; indeed evil are the deeds that they have done","9:10":"They neither honor the ties of relationship nor observe the obligations of treaties with the believers; it is they who are the transgressors","9:11":"However, if they repent, establish Salah and pay Zakah, then they shall be your brethren in Deen (faith and way of life based on Divine guidance): thus do We spell out Our revelations for people of understanding","9:12":"But if they violate their treaty once they have sworn it and insult your Deen, then fight with the ringleaders of the unbelief - for their oaths are nothing to them - so that they may be stopped","9:13":"Will you not fight against those people who have broken their oaths, conspired to expel the Messenger and were the first to attack you? Do you fear them? Nay, it is Allah Who is more deserving of your fear, if you are true believers","9:14":"Fight them; Allah will punish them by your hands and humiliate them. He will grant you victory over them and soothe the hearts of a believing people","9:15":"He will take away all rancor from their hearts. Allah shows mercy to whom He pleases, and Allah is All-Knowledgeable, All-Wise","9:16":"Do you think that you will be left alone (without trial)? While Allah has not yet demonstrated which of you had exerted your utmost struggle (in the path of Allah) and did not take any intimate friends other than Allah, His Messenger and the believers? Allah is well aware of all your actions","9:17":"It is not for the pagans to maintain the mosques of Allah while they bear witness against themselves about their unbelief. It is they whose deeds are in vain and in the hellfire shall they live forever","9:18":"The mosques of Allah should be maintained by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, establish Salah (prayers), and pay Zakah (poor due) and fear none except Allah. It is they who are expected to follow the true guidance","9:19":"Have you made those who provide water to the pilgrims and maintain the Masjid-al- Haram equal to those who believe in Allah, the Last Day and make Jihad? They are not equal in the sight of Allah, and Allah does not guide the wrongdoers","9:20":"Those who believe, leave their homes (migrate), and make Jihad with their wealth and persons in the cause of Allah, have higher rank in the sight of Allah. It is they who will be truly successful","9:21":"Their Lord gives them good news of His mercy, His good pleasure, and paradise with everlasting bliss","9:22":"They will live therein forever. Surely it is Allah with Whom is the mighty reward","9:23":"O believers! Do not take your fathers and your brothers as your friends if they prefer Kufr (unbelief) over Iman (belief); for those who turn away from this commandment shall be considered wrongdoers","9:24":"O Prophet, tell them: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your spouses, your relatives, the wealth that you have acquired, the business in which you fear a loss, and the homes which you like are dearer to you than Allah, His Messenger, and making Jihad (struggle) in His Way, then wait until Allah brings about His decision. Allah does not guide the transgressors","9:25":"Allah has indeed helped you in many battlefields and (recently) on the day of Hunain: when you were proud of your great numbers (the Muslim army was 12,000 strong and the unbelievers were only 4,000), but the numbers availed you nothing. The earth, with all its vastness, seemed to close in upon you, and you turned your backs and fled","9:26":"But Allah sent down His sakeenah (peace and tranquility) upon His Messenger and the believers and sent down to your aid those forces which you could not see, and punished the unbelievers. Thus was the recompense for the unbelievers","9:27":"Then after that, you also witnessed that Allah guided to repent some of them whom He wanted, for Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","9:28":"O believers! Know that pagans are unclean; therefore, do not let them come near the Masjid-al-Haram after this year's pilgrimage. If you fear poverty, soon Allah - if He so wills - will enrich you out of His bounty. Allah is All-Knowledgeable, All-Wise","9:29":"Fight those people of the Book (Jews and Christians) who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, do not refrain from what has been prohibited by Allah and His Messenger and do not embrace the religion of truth (Al-Islam), until they pay Jizya (protection tax) with their own hands and feel themselves subdued","9:30":"The Jews say: \"Uzair (Azra) is the son of Allah,\" and the Christians say: \" Messiah (Christ) is the son of Allah.\" That is what they say with their mouths, imitating the sayings of the former unbelievers. May Allah destroy them! How perverted they are","9:31":"They (Jews and Christians) have taken their rabbis and priests to be their Lords beside Allah and so they did with Messiah (Jesus), the son of Mary, although they were commanded to worship none but One Ilah (Allah); besides Whom there is none worthy of worship. Exalted be He above those whom they associate with Him","9:32":"They desire to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths but Allah seeks to perfect His light even though the disbelievers may dislike it","9:33":"It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and true Deen (faith) to make it prevail over all other deens (faiths) even though the pagans may hate it","9:34":"O believers! Indeed most of the rabbis and priests misappropriate the wealth of people and hinder them from the way of Allah. To those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in the way of Allah, proclaim a painful punishment","9:35":"The Day will surely come when their treasure will be heated up in the fire of hell, and their foreheads, sides and backs branded with it. They will be told: \"This is the treasure which you hoarded. Now taste what you were hoarding","9:36":"The number of months ordained by Allah is twelve in the Book of Allah since the day He created the heavens and the earth. Of these, four are sacred; that is the established principle of Deen. Therefore, do not wrong yourselves by violating them. But you may fight against the pagans in all these months if they fight against you in all of them. Know that Allah is with the righteous","9:37":"Transposing a prohibited month is only an addition to unbelief, thereby the disbelievers are misguided. They make a certain month lawful one year and in another year they make the same a forbidden month, so that they make up for the months which Allah has sanctified, thus making lawful what Allah has forbidden. Their evil actions seem pleasing to them. Allah does not guide the disbelieving people","9:38":"O believers! What is the matter with you that when you are asked to march forth in the way of Allah, you cling to the earth? Do you prefer the life of this world to the life of the hereafter? If it is so, then you should know that the comforts of this life are little compared to the life of the hereafter","9:39":"If you do not march forth, He will inflict on you a painful punishment and replace you with other people, and you cannot harm Him at all, for Allah has power over everything","9:40":"If you do not help the Prophet, it does not matter: Allah did help him when the unbelievers drove him out of his town, the second of the two, while the two were in the cave and (the enemy came to the opening of the cave) he said to his companion (Abu Bakr, later the first of the rightly- guided caliphs), \"Do not worry, Allah is with us.\" So Allah sent down his serenity on him and strengthened him with forces which you can not see, thus, He made the word of the unbelievers lowest, while words of Allah remain supreme. Allah is All- Mighty, All-Wise","9:41":"March forth whether you are equipped lightly or heavily and make Jihad in the way of Allah with your wealth and your persons. That is best for you if you understand","9:42":"As for the hypocrites, if the gain would have been immediate and the journey short, they would have certainly accompanied you, but the long journey (in Tabuk expedition) was too hard for them. To justify their not accompanying you, they would even swear by Allah, \"If we were able, we would certainly have marched with you.\" By doing so, they are destroying their own souls, for Allah knows that they are liars","9:43":"Allah forgives you! But why did you (O Muhammad) give them leave to stay behind? (You yourself should have not given them leave) so that it would have become clear which of them spoke the truth and which of them invented false excuses","9:44":"Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day will never ask you for exemption from fighting with their wealth and their persons. Allah is aware of those who are righteous","9:45":"Only those people ask for exemption who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day and whose hearts are filled with doubt, and are wavering because of their doubts","9:46":"If they had intended to march forth, they would certainly have made some preparation for it; but Allah did not like their going forth; so He made them lag behind and they were told \"stay behind with those who stay behind","9:47":"Had they gone with you they would have added nothing but mischief, and they would have made efforts to create disorder among your ranks, and there would have been some among you who would have listened to them. Allah knows the wrongdoers","9:48":"Indeed they had plotted sedition before and created disturbance to make you unsuccessful until the truth came through and the decree of Allah prevailed, even though they disliked it","9:49":"Among them there is someone (Jad-bin-Qais) who said: \"Grant me exemption and do not expose me to temptation (of Roman women’s beauty).\" Have they not fallen into temptation (of telling lies, double dealings and hypocrisy) already? Surely hell has encircled these disbelievers","9:50":"If you gain success, it grieves them, but if you face a setback, they say \"We had taken our precautionary measures,\" and turn away, rejoicing","9:51":"O Prophet, tell them: \"Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us; He is our protector;\" and in Allah let the believers put their trust","9:52":"Further tell them: \"Can you expect for us anything other than two excellent things (victory or martyrdom)? But we are waiting for Allah to afflict you with punishment either from Himself or by our hands. So wait if you will; we too are waiting","9:53":"Say: \"Whether you give willingly or with reluctance, it will not be accepted from you; for you are the people who are transgressors","9:54":"The reasons which prevent their contributions from being accepted are: that they disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger, that they come to offer Salah but reluctantly, and that they offer contributions but unwillingly","9:55":"Let neither their wealth nor their children dazzle you: in reality Allah intends to punish them with these things in this life and that their souls may depart while they are still unbelievers","9:56":"They swear by Allah that they are indeed believers like you; yet they are not of you; in fact, they are afraid to appear to you in their true colors","9:57":"If they could find a place of refuge or a cave, or any hiding-place, they would certainly run to it with an obstinate rush","9:58":"There are some among them who criticize you (O Muhammad) concerning the distribution of sadaqat. If they are given from it they are pleased, and if they are not given from it, lo! They are full of rage","9:59":"It would have been better for them, if they had only been pleased with what Allah and His Messenger had given them and said: \"Allah is all-sufficient to us! Soon Allah will give us of His bounty, and so will His Messenger. Indeed to Allah do we turn our hopes","9:60":"In fact the sadaqat (Zakah) collection is for the poor, the helpless, those employed to administer the funds, those whose hearts need to be won over to the truth, ransoming the captives, helping the destitute, in the Way of Allah and for the wayfarer. That is a duty enjoined by Allah; and Allah is All-Knowledgeable, Wise","9:61":"There are some people among them who molest the Prophet saying: \"He is one who believes everything that he hears.\" Say: \"It is good for you that he listens to what is best for you; he believes in Allah, has faith in the believers, and is a blessing for those of you who are true believers.\" As for those who molest the Messenger, will have a painful punishment","9:62":"They swear to you by Allah in order to please you. But it is more fitting that they should please Allah and His Messenger if they are true believers","9:63":"Don’t they know that anyone who opposes Allah and His Messenger shall live forever in the fire of hell? That surely is the worst humiliation","9:64":"The hypocrites are afraid lest a Surah should be sent down about them revealing to the Muslims what is in their hearts. Say: \"Mock if you will, Allah will surely bring to light all that you fear","9:65":"If you ask them, \"what were you talking about?\" They will promptly say: \"We were only jesting and having fun.\" Say: \"What, then! Were you mocking at Allah, His revelations and His Messenger","9:66":"Make no excuses now: you have rejected faith after your belief; even if We may pardon some of you who were not serious in participating, We will punish others amongst you, because they are criminals","9:67":"The hypocrite men and the hypocrite women, they are all alike. They enjoin what is evil, forbid what is just, and withhold their hands from doing good. They have forgotten Allah; so He has forgotten them. In fact the hypocrites are transgressors","9:68":"Allah has promised the hypocrite men, the hypocrite women, and the unbelievers the fire of hell to live therein forever, a sufficient recompense. Allah has cursed them and they shall have a lasting punishment","9:69":"Your behavior is just like those who have gone before you. They were mightier than you in power and more flourishing in wealth and children. They enjoyed their portion of this worldly life; thus have you enjoyed your portion as did those before you; and you have entered into vain discourses as they did. Consequently their deeds were fruitless in this world and in the Hereafter, and they are the ones who are the losers","9:70":"Have they not heard the news of those who have gone before them? The people of Noah, Ad and Thamud; the people of Abraham, the men of Madyan and the cities which were overthrown. Their Messengers came to them with clear warnings; but they did not listen, Allah did not wrong them, but they wronged their own souls","9:71":"The true believers, both men and women, are protectors of one another. They enjoin what is just and forbid what is evil; they establish Salah, pay Zakah, and obey Allah and His Messenger. It is they on whom Allah will have His mercy; surely Allah is Mighty, Wise","9:72":"Allah has promised to the believers, both men and women, gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever, and they will have beautiful mansions in these gardens of everlasting bliss. Best of all, they will have the good pleasure of Allah. Now that is the highest achievement","9:73":"O Prophet! Make Jihad against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be firm against them. Hell shall be their home; and it is the worst of all homes","9:74":"They swear by Allah that they said nothing when in fact they uttered the words of unbelief and they committed Kufr after accepting Islam. They meditated a plot which they were unable to carry out. They had no reason to be revengeful, except that Allah and His Messenger had enriched them through His bounty. Therefore, if they repent it will indeed be better for them; but if they turn back (do not repent) Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this life and in the Hereafter, and they shall have none on earth to protect or help them","9:75":"There are some among them who made a covenant with Allah saying: \"If He bestows on us His bounty, we will spend in charity and become truly of the righteous","9:76":"But when He did bestow of His bounty they became stingy, turned back from their covenant and became evasive","9:77":"He put hypocrisy into their hearts to last till the Day wherein they shall meet Him as a consequence of their breach of covenant with Allah and the lies they told","9:78":"Are they not aware that Allah knows their secret thoughts and their secret counsels, and that Allah knows fully well all that is hidden","9:79":"As for those that taunt the believers who give freely and ridicule those who find nothing to give except the fruits of their labor; Allah will throw back their ridicule on them and they shall have a painful punishment","9:80":"O Prophet! It is the same, whether you ask forgiveness for them or not; even if you ask for their forgiveness seventy times, Allah is not going to forgive them: because they have disbelieved Allah and His Messenger. Allah does not guide those who are transgressors","9:81":"Those who remained behind (did not join the Tabuk expedition) were delighted to sit inactive behind Allah’s Messenger, and they hated to make Jihad with their goods and their persons in the cause of Allah. They said to each other \"Do not go forth in the heat.\" Say to them: \"The fire of hell is much more severe in heat.\" If only they could understand","9:82":"Let them laugh a little; much will they weep as a recompense for what they have earned","9:83":"From now on, if Allah brings you among them and any of them ask your permission to go forth for Jihad, say: \"You shall never be allowed to go forth with me nor fight an enemy in my company. You chose to sit inactive on the first occasion, therefore you shall now stay with those who stay behind","9:84":"You shall never offer funeral prayer for any of them who dies, nor shall you attend their burial, for they have denied Allah and His Messenger and died while they were transgressors","9:85":"Let neither their wealth nor their children dazzle you. Through these Allah wants to punish them in this world and let their souls depart while they are still disbelievers","9:86":"Whenever a Surah is revealed, saying: \" Believe in Allah and make Jihad along with His Messenger,\" capable people among them ask you for exemption, saying: \"Please leave us with those who are to stay at home","9:87":"They preferred to be with those who remain behind, as a result, a seal was set upon their hearts so that they do not understand","9:88":"But the Messenger and those who believe with him, make Jihad with their wealth and their persons. They are the ones who will have all the goodness, and they are the ones who will be successful","9:89":"Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever: that is the greatest achievement","9:90":"Some from among the desert Arabs also came with their excuses, begging exemption to stay behind; thus, those who lied to Allah and His Messenger sat inactive. Soon a painful punishment shall seize those of them who disbelieved","9:91":"There is no blame on the disabled, the sick, and those lacking the means, to stay behind so long as they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger. There is no way (blame) against those righteous people. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","9:92":"Likewise, there is no blame on those who came to you and requested the conveyance to the battlefront and you said: \"I am unable to provide you the conveyance,\" and they returned with their eyes streaming with tears; they were filled with sorrow that they had no resources of going forth to the battlefield at their own expense","9:93":"The way (blame) is only against those who begged exemption although they are rich. They preferred to be with those who remained behind. Allah has set a seal upon their hearts; so they do not know what they missed","9:94":"They will apologize to you with all sorts of excuses when you return to them. Say: \"Present no excuses: we shall not believe you: Allah has already revealed to us the whole truth about you. Now Allah and His Messenger will keep a watch over your conduct: in the end you will return to Him Who knows what is hidden and what is open, and He will tell you all that you have been doing","9:95":"They will swear to you by Allah when you return to them so that you may leave them alone. So leave them alone: they are filth. Hell shall be their abode, a punishment for their misdeeds","9:96":"They will swear to you in order to please you, but even if you be pleased with them (accept their excuses), Allah will never be pleased with these transgressors","9:97":"The Arabs of the desert are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy, and are least inclined to acknowledge the limits that Allah has revealed to his Messenger. Allah is All- Knowledgeable, All-Wise","9:98":"Some of the desert Arabs look upon whatever they spend in the way of Allah as a penalty and wait for some misfortune to befall you. May misfortune befall them! Allah hears all and knows all","9:99":"But some of the desert Arabs believe in Allah and the Last Day, and look on what they spend in the way of Allah as a means of bringing them close to Allah and to the prayers of the Messenger. Indeed, closer they shall be brought: soon Allah will admit them to His mercy. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","9:100":"As for the first pioneers who accepted Islam from the Muhajir (immigrants) and Ansar (supporters in Medina) and those who follow them in good deeds, Allah is well pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they shall live forever: that is the mighty achievement","9:101":"Some of the desert Arabs around you are hypocrites, and so are some of the residents of Medina, who are fanatical in their hypocrisy. You do not know them, but We know them. Soon We shall give them double punishment: then they shall be turned to the most severe chastisement","9:102":"There are some who have confessed their sins: they have mixed records of good and bad deeds. It is quite possible that Allah may turn to them in mercy, for Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","9:103":"Take sadaqat (this commanded sadaqat means - Zakat-ul-Mall) from their wealth, so that they may thereby be cleansed and purified, and pray for them; for your prayer will give them comfort. Allah hears all and knows all","9:104":"Do they not know that Allah accepts repentance from His servants and takes their sadaqat (charity), and surely Allah is the One Who is the Accepter of Repentance, the Merciful","9:105":"Tell them: \"Do as you will. Allah, His Messenger and the believers will now keep a watch over your conduct; then you shall be brought to His court Who knows the hidden and the open, and He will inform you of all that you have done","9:106":"There are yet others whose case is held in suspense for the decision of Allah. He will either punish them or turn to them in mercy; and Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:107":"There are others who built a Masjid for mischievous motives (Masjid-e-Zirar), to spread disbelief and to disunite the believers, and an outpost for one (Abu ‘Amir) who had made war against Allah and His Messenger before. They will indeed swear that their intentions are nothing but good; but Allah declares that they are absolute liars","9:108":"You should never stand to offer Salah in it. Certainly the Masjid founded on piety from the very first day is more deserving that you should stand to offer Salah in it; for in it there are men who love to be purified; and Allah loves those who purify themselves","9:109":"Who is a better person; he who lays the foundation of his building on piety to Allah and His good pleasure, or he who lays the foundation of his building on an undermined bank that will tumble down with him into the fire of Hell? Allah does not guide such wrongdoers","9:110":"The foundation of those who so build is never free from suspicion and shakiness in their hearts until their hearts are cut to pieces. Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:111":"Indeed Allah has purchased from the believers their persons and their wealth and in return has promised them paradise; they fight in the cause of Allah and slay and are slain. This is a true promise which is binding on Him mentioned in Torah, the Gospel and the Qur’an; and who is more true in fulfilling his promise than Allah? Rejoice, therefore, in the bargain which you have made, and that is a mighty achievement","9:112":"Those that turn to Allah in repentance, serve Him, praise Him, move about in the land for His sake, make Rakuh (bow down in prayer) and Sajud (prostrate themselves in prayer), enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and observe the limits (permissions and prohibitions) set by Allah (they are the ones who make such a bargain with Allah). O Prophet, proclaim the good news to such believers","9:113":"It is not proper for the Prophet and those who believe that they should beg forgiveness for the pagans, even though they be their relatives, after it has been explained to them that they are the inmates of hellfire","9:114":"Abraham prayed for his father’s forgiveness only to fulfill a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah he disassociated himself from him. The fact is that Abraham was tenderhearted, forbearing","9:115":"It is not the way of Allah to confound people after He has guided them, until He makes clear to them what they should guard against; surely Allah has the knowledge of everything","9:116":"Surely it is Allah to Whom belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes to die. You have none besides Allah to protect or to help","9:117":"Allah forgave the Prophet and those Muhajir and the Ansar who stood by him in the time of distress, when some were on the point of losing heart. He turned to them in mercy. Surely to them He is Most Kind, Most Merciful","9:118":"He also turned in mercy to the three, the decision of whose case was deferred. So despondent were they that the earth, with all its vastness, and their own souls, seemed to close in upon them. They knew for certain that there was no refuge from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to them in mercy so that they could repent. Surely Allah is the One Who is Oft- Returning, the Merciful","9:119":"O believers! Have fear of Allah and be with those who are truthful in word and deed","9:120":"It is not proper for the people of Medina and the beduin Arabs of the neighborhood to forsake the Messenger of Allah or to jeopardize his life so as to safeguard their own: because they do not suffer any thirst or hunger or any ordeal for the sake of Allah, or take any step which may provoke the unbelievers, or receive any injury from an enemy, but shall be written down as a good deed to their account; for Allah does not waste the reward of the righteous","9:121":"Likewise, they do not spend anything for the cause of Allah, be it small or large, or cut across a valley in Jihad, but is written down to their credit; so that Allah may reward them based on the best of their deeds","9:122":"It is not proper that the believers should go forth all together. Therefore, why not a squadron from each division stay behind so that they may obtain the understanding of Deen (Al-Islam), and admonish the people when they return to them so that they may refrain from un-Islamic conduct","9:123":"O believers! Fight the unbelievers who hem you in, to let them know how strong you are; you should know that Allah is on the side of the Godfearing","9:124":"Whenever a Surah is revealed, some of them ask: \"Whose faith from among you has increased by this?\" Certainly the faith of the believers is increased and they do rejoice","9:125":"As for those whose hearts contain malice, it will add filth to their existing filth, and they will die while they are still disbelievers","9:126":"Do they not see that they are tested every year once or twice? Yet they neither repent nor learn a lesson from this","9:127":"Whenever a Surah is revealed they look at each other as if to ask, \"Is anyone watching?\" Then they silently slip away. Allah has slipped their hearts (from the guidance), for they are a people who do not want to understand","9:128":"Now, there has come to you a Messenger from among yourselves, the one who grieves at your loss and who is excessively anxious for your success in both worlds, and who is compassionate and merciful towards the believers","9:129":"Now, if they turn away from you, (O Prophet) say: \"Allah is all-sufficient for me. There is no god but Him. In Him I have put my trust. He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne","10:1":"Alif L'am Ra. These are the verses of the Book of Wisdom","10:2":"Does it seem strange to the people that We revealed Our will to a man from among themselves, saying: \"Warn mankind and give the good news to the Believers that they are on sound footing with their Lord?\" The disbelievers say: \"This man is indeed an obvious magician","10:3":"The fact is that your Lord is the same Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six days and is firmly established on the Throne of authority, and is directing the affairs of the universe. None can intercede for you, except the one who receives His permission. This is Allah your Lord, so worship Him: will you not receive admonition","10:4":"To Him you shall all return. Allah’s promise is true. He is the One Who originates the process of Creation and repeats it (will bring it back to life) so that He may justly reward those who believed in Him and did righteous deeds. As for those who disbelieved, they shall have boiling fluids to drink and shall undergo a painful punishment because they rejected the truth","10:5":"He is the One Who gave the sun its brightness and the moon its light, established her phases that you may learn to compute the years and other such counts (days, weeks, months). Allah created them only to manifest the truth. He has spelled out His revelations for people who want to understand","10:6":"Indeed in the alternation of the night and the day and what Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are signs for those who are Godfearing","10:7":"As for those who do not hope to meet Us on the Day of Judgement, being well pleased and satisfied with this worldly life and those who give no heed to Our revelations","10:8":"they shall have the Fire as their abode because of what they had earned (erroneous creed and wrong conduct)","10:9":"It is also a fact that those who believe sincerely in the truth which is revealed in this Book and do good deeds, their Lord will guide them because of their faith and rivers will flow beneath their feet in the gardens of bliss","10:10":"Their slogan therein will be: \"Glory to You O Allah!\" And their greetings therein will be \"Peace be upon you!\" And their closing remarks will be: \"All praises are for Allah Alone, the Lord of the Worlds","10:11":"If Allah were to hasten the punishment for their evil as they hasten in asking good of this world, then the respite given to the people would have been terminated, but this is not Our way. We leave those people alone who do not entertain the hope of meeting Us, to blunder about in their rebellion","10:12":"Whenever affliction touches a man, he prays to Us, whether lying down on his side, sitting, or standing on his feet. But as soon as We relieve his affliction he walks away as if he had never prayed to Us for removing that affliction which touched him! Thus the foul deeds which they do are made fair-seeming to the transgressors","10:13":"We have destroyed generations before your time when they adopted unjust attitudes: their Messengers came to them with clear signs but they would not believe! Thus, do We requite the criminals","10:14":"Then, We made you their successors in the land so that We may observe how you would conduct yourselves","10:15":"When Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who entertain no hope of meeting Us say to you: \"Bring us a Qur’an different than this or make some changes in it.\" O Muhammad, tell them: \"It is not possible for me to change it myself. I follow only what is revealed to me. Indeed, I cannot disobey my Lord, for I fear the punishment of a Mighty Day","10:16":"Say: \"If Allah wanted otherwise, I would have not recited this (Qur’an) to you, nor would have made you aware of it. Indeed, a whole lifetime I lived among you before its revelation. Why do you not use your common-sense","10:17":"Who can be more unjust than the one who himself forges a lie, then ascribes it to Allah or falsifies His real Revelations? Indeed, such criminals can never prosper","10:18":"They worship other deities besides Allah, who can neither harm them nor benefit them, and they say: \"These are our intercessors with Allah.\" O Muhammad, say to them: \"Are you informing Allah of what He knows to exist neither in the heavens nor on the earth? Glory to Him! He is far above from having the partners they ascribe to Him","10:19":"Mankind was once just one nation; later on they became divided through inventing different creeds. If your Lord had not already given His word ( specified time for the life of mankind on Earth), the matters in which they differ would have certainly been decided","10:20":"In regards to their saying: \"Why has not a sign been sent down to him (Muhammad) from his Lord?\" Tell them: \" Allah Alone has the knowledge of the unseen. Wait if you will: I too shall wait with you","10:21":"When We show mercy to mankind after some calamity had afflicted them, they begin to plot against Our revelations! Tell them: \"Allah is more swift in plotting than you; indeed Our angels are recording all the plots you make","10:22":"He is the One Who enables you to travel through the land and by the sea; until when you are on board a ship, as the ship sails with a favorable wind and they feel happy about it; but when there comes a stormy wind and the waves reach them from all sides and they think they are being overwhelmed: then they pray to Allah with their sincere devotion, saying, \"If You deliver us from this, we shall become your true thankful devotees","10:23":"Yet, when He does deliver them, behold! The same people become unjustly rebellious in the land. O mankind! Your rebellion is against your own souls ( you may enjoy) the transitory pleasure of this world - in the end you have to return to Us, then We shall inform you of what you have done","10:24":"The example of this worldly life (which you love so much that you have even become neglectful of Our signs) is like the water which We send down from the sky; it mingles with the soil and produces vegetation which becomes the food for men and animals. Then, at the very time when the crops are ripened and the land looks attractive, the people to whom it belongs think that they are able to cultivate it, and there comes Our scourge upon it, by night or in broad day, and We mow it down thoroughly as if nothing existed there yesterday! Thus do We spell out Our signs for those who are thoughtful","10:25":"Allah invites you to the Home of Peace and guides whom He pleases to the Right Way","10:26":"Those who do good deeds shall have a good reward and even more than they deserve! Neither blackness nor disgrace shall cover their faces. They will be the inhabitants of paradise; they will live therein forever","10:27":"As for those who have done evil deeds, they will be rewarded with like evil: disgrace will cover them - they shall have none to protect them from Allah - as if their faces have been covered with patches of the dense darkness of night. They will become the inmates of the Fire; they will live therein forever","10:28":"On the Day when We shall gather them all together, We shall say to those who committed shirk (associated other deities with Us): \"Stay where you are, you and those whom you set as partners with Us.\" We will separate them from one another, then the shoraka' (partners they had set up with Us) will say: \"It was not us that you worshipped","10:29":"Allah is an all-sufficient witness between you and us, (even if you worshipped us) we were quite unaware of your worship","10:30":"Thereupon, every soul shall know what it had sent forth, as they will be brought in the Court of Allah, their true Patron, and their invented falsehoods will leave them in the lurch","10:31":"Ask them: \"Who provides your sustenance from the heaven and from the earth? Who has control over hearing and sight? Who brings forth the living from the dead and the dead from the living? Who regulates the universe?\" They will soon reply: \"Allah.\" Say: \"Why do you not then fear Him for your going against the truth","10:32":"The same Allah is your real Lord: What is left after the truth except falsehood? How then can you turn away","10:33":"Thus has the Word of your Lord proved true in regards to the transgressors that they do not believe","10:34":"Ask them: \"Can any of your shoraka' (the deities you worship besides Allah) create anything and then repeat its process?\" If they do not answer, then tell them: \"Well, Allah creates and then repeats the process. Then how is that you are so misled","10:35":"Again ask them: \"Is there any of your shoraka' who can guide you to the truth?\" If they do not answer, then tell them: \"Well, Allah can guide you to the truth. Then who is more worthy to be followed: He that can guide to the truth, or he that cannot and is himself in need of guidance? What is the matter with you? What kind of judgement do you make","10:36":"The fact is that most of them follow nothing but mere conjecture and conjecture is in no way a substitute for the truth. Surely Allah is well aware of all that they do","10:37":"This Qur’an is not such as could be produced by anyone other than Allah; in fact it is the confirmation of prior revelations (Psalms, Torah, and Gospel) and fully explains the Holy Book (prior scriptures); there is no doubt in this fact that it is (revealed) from the Lord of the Worlds","10:38":"Do they say: \"He (the Prophet) has forged it?\" Tell them: \"If what you say be true; then produce one Surah like this, you may even call to your aid anyone you want other than Allah","10:39":"Nay! They do not believe that which they cannot grasp, for they have not yet seen its prophecy fulfilled. The same way those who passed before them disbelieved. But see what was the end of the wrongdoers","10:40":"Of these people there are some who will believe in it and some will not: and your Lord best knows the troublemakers","10:41":"If they do not believe you, say: \"I am responsible for my actions and you are for yours! You are not accountable for my actions, nor I am responsible for what you do","10:42":"There are some among them who pretend to hear what you say: but can you make the deaf listen to you, incapable as they are of understanding","10:43":"Then there are some among them who pretend to look at you: but can you show the way to the blind, bereft as they are of sight","10:44":"The fact is that Allah does not do injustice to mankind in any way: but men are unjust to their own souls","10:45":"On that Day when He will gather them all together, it will appear to them as if they had not stayed in this world but an hour of a day to get to know each other. At that time they will realize that: in fact the losers are those who denied the meeting with Allah and were not rightly guided","10:46":"Whether We show you in your lifetime some consequences of what We have promised them, or cause you to die before that, in any case they will have to return to Us: moreover Allah is watching all their actions","10:47":"Every nation was sent a Messenger. Once their Messenger came, judgement was passed between them with all fairness and they were not wronged in the least","10:48":"They ask: \"When will this promise be fulfilled, tell us if what you say be true","10:49":"Say: \"I have no control over any harm or benefit to myself, except what Allah wills. For every nation there is a deadline: when their deadline comes, it can neither be delayed for even a moment, nor it can be advanced","10:50":"Say: \"Have you ever considered that if His scourge fall upon you by night or by day you can do nothing to avert it? What then is there that the criminals wish to hasten","10:51":"Would you believe it when it actually overtakes you? Then you would beg it to be removed although it had been your own wish to hurry it on","10:52":"Then it will be said to the wrongdoers: \"Taste the everlasting punishment! Should you not be rewarded according to your deeds","10:53":"They ask you: \"Is what you say really true?\" Tell them: \"Yes! By my Lord, it is absolutely true! And you will not be able to avert it","10:54":"If every person that has done injustice possessed all that the earth contains, he would be willing to offer it all in ransom to redeem himself if he could. They will regret in their hearts when they see the punishment of Hell. The decision between them will be made with justice and no wrong will be done to them","10:55":"Be aware! All that is in the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. Be aware! The promise of Allah is true, yet most of them do not know","10:56":"He is the One Who gives life and causes death, and to Him you shall all return","10:57":"O mankind! There has come to you an instruction from your Lord, a cure for whatever (disease) is in your hearts, a guidance and a blessing for the true believers","10:58":"Say: \"It is the grace and mercy of Allah (that He has sent this Qur’an), so let the people rejoice over it, for it is better than (the worldly riches) they are collecting","10:59":"O Prophet, ask them: \"Have you ever considered that out of the sustenance which Allah has given you, you yourselves have made some things Halal (lawful) and others Haram (unlawful)? Ask them: \"Did Allah permit you to do so, or do you ascribe a false thing to Allah","10:60":"What treatment do they think those people will get, who ascribe false things to Allah, on the Day of Resurrection? Indeed Allah is full of grace to mankind, but most of them are not grateful","10:61":"No matter what affairs you may be engaged in, what portion from the Qur’an you may be reciting and whatever deeds you may be doing, We are a Witnesses thereof when you are deeply occupied with it: for there is not even an iota of anything in the earth or in the heaven that is hidden from your Lord, neither anything smaller than that nor larger, but is recorded in a Glorious Book","10:62":"Be aware! The friend of Allah has nothing to fear or to regret","10:63":"Those who believe and (constantly) guard against evil","10:64":"for them there is good news in this life and in the hereafter - Allah’s Words do not change - this is indeed the mighty achievement","10:65":"O Prophet, let not their remarks grieve you: surely all honor belongs to Allah: He hears all and knows all","10:66":"Be aware! Indeed whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth belongs to Allah. Those who invoke other deities besides Allah follow nothing but conjectures and preach nothing but falsehood","10:67":"He is the One Who has made the night for you to rest therein and the day so that you can see. Indeed, there are signs in this for those who listen to His message","10:68":"They (Jews and Christians) say: \"Allah has begotten a son!\" Glory be to Him! He is self-sufficient! His is all that is in the Heavens and in the Earth! Have you any proof for what you say?

Then execute it against me and give me no respite","10:72":"If you have turned away from my message, I did not lose any thing, for I did not ask any reward from you for my services: my reward is only with Allah, I have been commanded to become a Muslim","10:73":"But they disbelieved him. As a result, We saved him and those of them who were with him in the Ark and We made them successors in the Earth and drowned those who rejected Our revelations. You see what was the end of those who were warned but did not believe","10:74":"Then after him We sent Messengers to their descendants. They came to them with clear signs but they would not believe what they had rejected before. Thus, do We set seals upon the hearts of those who (intentionally) exceed the limits","10:75":"Then later on We sent Moses and Haroon (Aaron) to Pharoah (Pharaoh) and his chiefs with Our signs. But they showed arrogance, for they were a guilty nation","10:76":"When the truth did come to them from Us they said: \"This is indeed sheer magic","10:77":"Moses replied: \"Is this what you say of the Truth when it has come to you? Is this a magic? Magicians do not prosper","10:78":"They said: \"Have you come to turn us away from the faith of our forefathers in order that you two (Moses and Haroon) may become the leaders in the land? We will never believe in you","10:79":"Pharoah said: \"Bring me every skillful magician","10:80":"When the magicians came, Moses said to them: \"Throw what you wish to throw","10:81":"So when they had thrown, Moses said: \"The magic that you have brought, Allah will surely prove it wrong: for Allah does not promote the work of mischief makers","10:82":"By His Words Allah vindicates the truth, much as the criminals may dislike it","10:83":"None but a few youth from his own people believed in Moses, because of the fear of Pharoah (Pharaoh) and his chiefs, lest they should persecute them; and certainly Pharoah was mighty in the land and the one who did not hesitate to transgress any limit","10:84":"Moses said: \"O my people! If you sincerely believe in Allah, then put your trust in Him, if you are really Muslims","10:85":"They replied: \"In Allah do we put our trust. Our Lord! Do not let us suffer at the hands of unjust people","10:86":"and deliver us through Your mercy, from the nation of unbelievers","10:87":"We revealed Our will to Moses and his brother, saying: \"Take your people to dwell in Egypt, and make your houses as your Qiblah (places of worship) and establish Salah and give good news to the believers","10:88":"Moses prayed: \"Our Lord!

In fact, our father is clearly mistaken","12:9":"Let us kill Joseph or throw him out to some far-off land so that the attention of our father turns exclusively towards us, after that, we may again become righteous people","12:10":"At this one of them said: \"Do not kill Joseph, but if you must, throw him into some dark well, so that he may be picked up by some passing by caravan","12:11":"After this meeting, they asked their father: \"O our father! Why is it that you do not trust us with Joseph, though we are his sincere well-wishers","12:12":"Send him with us tomorrow, that he may play and enjoy himself. We shall take good care of him","12:13":"Their father said: \"I will be worried if you take him away, for I fear lest a wolf should eat him up while you are off your guard","12:14":"They said: \"If a wolf could eat him despite our number, then surely we would be worthless people","12:15":"When after such persistence they were able to take him away, they resolved to throw him into a dark well. We revealed this (to Joseph) : \"A time will come when you will admonish them about this act of theirs, now they do not perceive its consequences","12:16":"At nightfall they return to their father, weeping","12:17":"They said: \"Father! We went off to compete in racing with one another, and left Joseph by our belongings, and a wolf ate him !

I need good patience! Allah Alone can help me bear the loss you are speaking of","12:19":"On the other side, a caravan passed by, and sent a water carrier who let down his bucket into the well. Seeing Joseph in it, he shouted with joy: \"Good news! I found a young boy.\" They concealed him like trade merchandise. But Allah knew what they did","12:20":"They (brought him to Egypt and) sold him for a petty price, a few dirhams (silver coins), they had such a low estimation of him","12:21":"The Egyptian who bought Joseph said to his wife: \"Be kind to him. He may prove useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son.\" Thus We established Joseph in the land and arranged to teach him the understanding of affairs.

Such wrongdoers shall not prosper","12:24":"She advanced toward him, and he would have advanced towards her had he not seen a sign from his Lord. Thus did We shield him from indecency and immodesty, for he was one of Our chosen, a sincere devotee","12:25":"They both rushed to the door. In order to stop him she caught his shirt, and as a result she ripped his shirt from behind. At the door they met her husband. Seeing him she cried: \"What punishment does someone who intended evil against your wife deserve except imprisonment or a painful chastisement","12:26":"Joseph said: \"It was she who attempted to seduce me.\" At this - one accusing the other - one member of her own family bore witness saying: \"If his shirt is ripped from the front, then she is speaking the truth and he is lying","12:27":"But if it is ripped from behind, then he is speaking the truth and she is lying","12:28":"So when he (her husband) saw that Joseph's shirt was ripped from behind, he said to her: \"It is one of the tricks of you women! Your trick was mighty indeed","12:29":"O Joseph, say no more about this, and you (O my wife) seek forgiveness for your sins, for you were indeed the wrongdoer","12:30":"The women of the city began to talk about this incident, saying: \"The wife of Al-Aziz has seduced her young slave, for she has fallen madly in love with him. In fact, we see her in manifest error","12:31":"When she heard about these remarks, she invited them and prepared for them a banquet, and gave each of them a knife. When they were engaged in cutting fruit, she asked Joseph to come out before them. When they saw him, they were so amazed that they cut their hands and exclaimed spontaneously: \"Good Lord! He is no human being; he is but a noble angel","12:32":"She said: \"Well, this is he about whom you blamed me. No doubt I seduced him, but he escaped. If he doesn’t do what I say, he will certainly be thrown into prison and be disgraced","12:33":"Joseph said: \"O my Lord! I would rather go to prison than that to which they invite me; and unless You ward off their cunning snare from me, I may, in my youthful folly, feel inclined towards them and become one of the ignorant","12:34":"Thereupon his Lord granted his prayer and warded off their cunning snare from him; surely He hears all and knows all","12:35":"Still, even after all the evidence they had seen (of his innocence and the guilt of their women), they thought it proper to send him to prison for a while","12:36":"MidEastWeb for Coexistence http:www.mideastweb.org 111 Two young men also entered the prison along with him. One day one of them said: \"I saw in a dream that I was pressing wine.\" The other said: \"I saw in a dream that I was carrying bread on my head, of which birds were eating.\" Tell us the interpretation of these dreams, for we see that you are a man of virtue","12:37":"Joseph replied: \"I will, with Allah’s permission, tell you the interpretation of these dreams before you are served the food you eat, this is part of the knowledge which my Lord has taught me. In fact, I have forsaken the faith of those people who do not believe in Allah and even deny the hereafter","12:38":"I follow the faith of my forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It is not fitting that we attribute any partners with Allah. It is the grace of Allah on us and on mankind (that He has not made us the servants of anyone else other than Himself), yet most of the people are not grateful","12:39":"O my fellow inmates! Tell me what is better; many different lords or one Allah, the Irresistible","12:40":"Those you serve besides Him are nothing but mere names which you and your forefathers have invented, for which Allah has revealed no sanction. The Command belongs to none but Allah, Who has ordained that you worship none but Him. That is the true faith, yet most of the people do not know","12:41":"O my fellow inmates! (Here is the interpretation of your dreams), one of you will be released and serve wine to your lord (the king of Egypt); and the other will be crucified and the birds will eat from his head. That's how your cases will be decided concerning which you inquired (that is the answer to your question)","12:42":"Then, to the one who he thought would be released, he said: \"Mention me to your lord.\" But Satan made him forget to mention (Joseph) to his lord, so he remained in the prison a few more years","12:43":"One day the king of Egypt said: \"I saw seven fat cows in my dream which were eaten up by seven lean cows, likewise I saw seven green ears of corn and seven others that were dried up. O chiefs! Tell me the meaning of my dream if you can interpret the dreams","12:44":"They replied: \"Confused nightmares! We are not skilled in the interpretation of dreams","12:45":"Thereupon one of the two inmates who was released remembered Joseph after all that time, and he said: \"I will tell you its interpretation; just send me to Joseph in the prison","12:46":"He came to Joseph in the prison and said: \"O Joseph the truthful one! Tell us the meaning of the dream of seven fat cows which are eaten up by seven lean ones and of seven green ears of corn and seven others dried up: so that I may return to the people and let them know the meaning of this dream","12:47":"He replied: \"You will cultivate for seven consecutive years. During this time you should leave the corn you reap in the ear, except what may be sufficient for your food","12:48":"Then, after that period, there will come upon you seven hard years which will eat away all that you had stored except a little which you may have specifically set aside","12:49":"After that period will come a year of abundant rain, in which the people will squeeze the juice","12:50":"The king said: \"Bring this man to me.\" When the messenger came to Yusuf, he said \"Go back to your lord and ask him about the case of the women who cut their hands. Indeed my Rabb has full knowledge of their snare","12:51":"The king questioned those women, saying: \"What do you say about the incident when you attempted to seduce Yusuf?\" They replied: \"God forbid! We Know of no evil on his part.\" The `Aziz’s wife said: \"Now that the truth has come to light, it was I who attempted to seduce him. In fact he is absolutely truthful","12:52":"Joseph said, \"By this inquiry I meant to let him (Al-Aziz) know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that Allah does not let the snare of the treacherous succeed","12:53":"Not that I am free from sin - man’s soul is prone to evil, except the one to whom my Lord has shown mercy, certainly my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful","12:54":"The king said: \"Bring him to me; I will take him for my special service.\" When Joseph had a talk with the King, he said: \"From now on, you have an honorable place with us, and you will enjoy our full confidence","12:55":"Joseph said: \"Place me over all the resources of the land. Certainly I know how to manage; I have the necessary knowledge","12:56":"Thus We established Joseph in the land to live therein in any way he wished. We bestow Our mercy on whom We please and We do not let the reward of good people go to waste","12:57":"Yet the reward in the hereafter will be even better for those who believe and are righteous","12:58":"Several years later when the famine started and there was no food available outside of Egypt, Joseph’s brothers came to Egypt for food and entered his office. He recognized them but they did not recognize him","12:59":"When he had given them their due provisions and they were about to leave, he said: \"Bring your half brother to me next time. Do you not see that I give full measure and provide the best hospitality","12:60":"But if you do not bring him, you shall have no grain, nor shall you even come near me again","12:61":"They replied: \"We shall certainly try our best to bring him from his father. This we will surely do","12:62":"Joseph told his servants to put his brother's money into their saddlebags secretly so that they should know about it only when they reach their family, so that they might come back","12:63":"When Joseph's brothers returned to their father, they said: \"Father! Grain is henceforth denied us unless we take our stepbrother with us; please send our brother with us so that we may get our measure; we take full responsibility for his safety","12:64":"He said: \"Should I trust you with him as I once trusted you with his brother? Allah is the best protector and He is the Most Merciful of the mercygivers","12:65":"When they opened their baggage, they discovered that their money had been returned to them. \"Father!\" They cried with joy, \"What more can we ask for? Here is our money returned back to us. We will buy more food for our family, we will take good care of our brother and obtain an extra camel load of grain. This way, it will be easy to add another camel load of grain","12:66":"Jacob replied: \"I will never send him with you until you pledge in the name of Allah that you will surely bring him back to me unless you become helpless.\" And when they had given their pledge, he said: \"Allah is the Witness over the pledge you made","12:67":"Then he said; \"My sons! Do not enter the capital city of Egypt through one gate, enter from the different gates. Not that I can avail you aught against Allah; this advice is just a precaution, because none can accurately judge except Allah. In Him do I put my trust and in Him let all the reliant put their trust","12:68":"When avert the fear he had in his heart. Indeed he possessed the knowledge which We had given him, but most people do not know","12:69":"When they entered to Joseph, he called his brother (Benjamin) alone to himself, and said: \"In fact, I am your brother (Joseph), now you need not grieve at what they have been doing","12:70":"While Joseph was arranging the loading of their provisions, he put the royal drinking cup into his brother’s pack. Later on a crier called out: \"O people of the caravan! You must be thieves","12:71":"They turned back and asked: \"What have you lost","12:72":"The royal servants said: \"We have lost the King’s drinking cup. (The leader of the royal servants added) and the one who brings it, will be awarded a camel-load of corn, I guarantee it","12:73":"Joseph’s brothers said: \"By Allah! You should know, by our behavior during our stay here, that we did not come here to make mischief in the land and we are no thieves","12:74":"The royal servants said: \"What should be the punishment of the thief, if you are liars","12:75":"They replied: \"The punishment of he in whose pack you find the royal cup will be to make him your bondsman, that’s how we punish wrongdoers","12:76":"After this Joseph first began to search the packs of his stepbrothers before the pack of his own brother (Benjamin). Finally he took it out of his brother’s pack. Thus We directed Joseph. He could not seize his brother under the King’s law; but Allah willed otherwise. We exalt in ranks whom We please, He is the One Whose knowledge is far greater than the knowledge of all others","12:77":"At this accusation, his brothers remarked: \"This is not strange if he has committed a theft for his brother also committed a theft before him.\" Hearing this, Joseph suppressed his feelings and did not reveal anything to them - he simply whispered to himself: \"What a bad people you are! You are accusing me of something, the truth of which Allah knows best","12:78":"They said: \"O noble prince! He (Benjamin) has a very aged father who may not be able to survive without him, so please take one of us instead of him. We see that you are one of those who do good to others","12:79":"Joseph replied: \"God forbid that we should seize other than the one with whom we found our property: if we did so then indeed we would be unjust","12:80":"When they lost their hope of moving Joseph, they went aside to confer in private. The eldest of them said: \"You know that your father had taken a solemn pledge in the name of Allah, and you also know how you fell short of your duty with respect to Joseph. Therefore, I am not going to leave this land until my father gives me permission or Allah decides for me, and He is the best of all judges","12:81":"Go back to your father and tell him, \"father, your son committed theft. We did not see him stealing, we testify only to what we know. How could we guard against the unforeseen","12:82":"You may enquire from the people of the city where we lodged and the caravan in which we travelled that we are indeed telling the truth","12:83":"When they went back and told all this to their father, \" No!\" Cried their father, \" Your souls have contrived a story for you. Well, I will bear this too with good patience. Maybe Allah will bring them all back to me; indeed He is the Knowledgeable, the Wise","12:84":"He turned his face away from them, crying: \"Alas for Joseph!\" His eyes became white with grief, and he became sorely oppressed","12:85":"They said: \"By Allah! It appears that you will not cease to remember Joseph until you ruin your health or kill yourself","12:86":"He said: \"I complain of my distress and grief to Allah Alone and I know from Allah what you do not know","12:87":"O my sons! Go and search for Joseph and his brother. Never give up hope of Allah’s mercy; in fact none despairs of Allah’s mercy except the unbelieving people","12:88":"When they went back to Egypt and entered Joseph’s office, they said: \"Noble prince! We and our family are in great distress, we have hardly any money, please give us full quota and also some charity. Surely Allah rewards the charitable","12:89":"Hearing this, Joseph, who could contain himself no longer, replied: \"Do you know what you did to Joseph and his brother while acting out of ignorance","12:90":"This took them by surprise, and they cried: \"What! Are you really Joseph?\" He said: \"Yes! I am Joseph and this is my brother. Allah has indeed been gracious to us. In fact as for the righteous and patient; Allah really does not let the reward of the righteous be wasted","12:91":"They said: \"By Allah! Certainly Allah has preferred you over us. We have indeed been guilty","12:92":"Joseph said: \"There is no blame on you today. May Allah forgive you! He is the most Merciful of those who show mercy","12:93":"Go, take this shirt of mine and cast it over the face of my father, he will recover his sight. Then come back to me with all the members of your family","12:94":"When the caravan started (from Egypt) their father (who was in Ken’an) said: \"Certainly I feel the scent of Joseph, even though you may think I am out of my mind","12:95":"The people, who heard him, said: \"By Allah! You are still suffering from your old illusion","12:96":"But when the bearer of the good news arrived, he cast the shirt of Joseph over his face and he regained his sight. Then he said: \"Didn’t I tell you that I know from Allah what you do not know","12:97":"They said: \"Father! Pray for the forgiveness for our sins. We have indeed done wrong","12:98":"He replied: \"Soon I will ask my Lord for your forgiveness; surely He is the One who is the Forgiving, the Merciful","12:99":"When they came to Joseph, he asked his parents to lodge with himself, and said: \"Now enter the city. Allah willing, you will live here in peace","12:100":"After entering the city he helped his parents to seats on the throne, and they all fell down in prostration before him. \"This,\" said Joseph to his father, \"is the interpretation of my dream which I dreamt long before. My Lord has really made it come true. It was His grace that He took me out of prison and brought you all here from the desert even though Satan had stirred up strife between me and my brothers. For sure my Lord fulfills His plan in mysterious ways. Surely He is the One Who is the Knowledgeable, the Wise","12:101":"O Lord! You have indeed given me a kingdom and taught me the interpretation of dreams. O, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, You are my Protector in this world and in the hereafter, make me die as a Muslim and admit me among the righteous","12:102":"O Muhammad, this story which We have revealed to you is a tale of the unseen; for you were not there with (the brothers of Joseph) when they collectively conspired and schemed against him","12:103":"Yet strive as you may, most men are not going to become believers","12:104":"even though You do not demand any recompense for this information. This Qur’an is nothing but a reminder for all the people of the worlds","12:105":"There are many signs in the heavens and the earth which they pass by; yet they pay no attention to them","12:106":"As a result most of them who believe in Allah also commit shirk","12:107":"Do they feel secure that Allah’s scourge will not fall on them, or that the Hour of Doom will not come upon them suddenly while they do not suspect it","12:108":"Tell them plainly: \"This is my way. I invite you to Allah with sure knowledge which I and my followers possess. Glory be to Allah, and I am not one of the pagans","12:109":"All the Messengers that We sent before you, O Muhammad, were human beings, to whom We sent Our Revelations after choosing them from the people of their town. Have these unbelievers not traveled through the land and seen what was the end of those who passed away before them? From their destiny you should know that the home of the hereafter is better for those who are righteous. Why don’t you understand","12:110":"Respite was granted until the Messengers gave up hope of their people and realized that they were being treated as liars, Our help came to them and We delivered those whom We pleased; and Our scourge was not averted from the criminal people","12:111":"There is a lesson in these stories of former people for the men of common sense. This story of Joseph revealed in the Qur’an is not an invented tale, but a confirmation of previous scriptures - a detailed exposition of all things, and is a guidance and blessing for the people who believe","13:1":"Alif L'am M'im Ra. These are the Verses of the Book (Qur'an) which has been revealed to you, O Muhammad, from your Lord is the Truth, but most of the people do not believe in this","13:2":"Allah is the One Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see, then firmly established Himself on the throne of authority and subjected the sun and the moon to His law - each one pursuing its course for an appointed time. He regulates all affairs. He has spelled out His revelations so that you may believe in meeting your Lord","13:3":"He is the One Who spread out the earth and placed thereon mountains and rivers, created fruits of every kind in pairs, two and two, and makes the night cover the day. Certainly in these things there are signs for those who use their common sense","13:4":"In the earth there are tracts side by side: gardens of grapes, cornfields and palm trees with single and double trunks - they are all watered with the same water, yet we make some of them excel others in taste. Surely in this, there are signs for people who use their common sense","13:5":"Now, if there is anything that seems strange, then strange is their saying: \"What! When we will become dust, could we then be raised to a new life again?\" They are the people who have denied their Lord, they are the ones who will have yokes around their necks and they are the ones who will be the inmates of Hellfire to live therein forever","13:6":"They ask you to hasten on the evil rather than the good, although there have been instances of exemplary punishments before them. In fact your Lord is the Lord of Forgiveness to the people, notwithstanding their wrongdoing; and it is also the fact that your Lord is stern in retribution","13:7":"The unbelievers say: \"Why is not a sign sent down to him (Muhammad) from his Lord?\" You are nothing but a Warner and every nation was assigned a guide","13:8":"Allah knows what every female bears in her womb. He is fully aware of what decrease or increase (miscarriage or a long wait) takes place in the womb. Everything has a due measure with Him","13:9":"He has perfect knowledge of both the visible and the invisible. He is the Great, the Most High","13:10":"It is the same to Him whether any of you speak in secret or aloud, whether anyone hides under the darkness of night or walks about in broad daylight","13:11":"Each person has been assigned guardian angels before him and behind him, who watch him by the command of Allah. The fact is that Allah never changes the condition of a people until they intend to change it themselves. If Allah wants to afflict a people with misfortune, none can ward it off, nor they can find any protector besides Him","13:12":"He is the One Who shows you lightning, which causes fear and hope, and brings up heavy clouds","13:13":"The thunder declares His glory with His praises and so do the angels with awe. He sends thunderbolts and smites with them whomever He wants. Yet these unbelievers dispute concerning Allah; He is mighty in strength","13:14":"Praying to Him Alone is the right thing. The other deities they pray to, besides Him, cannot answer their prayers. They are like a man who stretches forth his hands to the water and asks it to reach his mouth. It cannot reach his mouth this way; likewise the prayer of the unbelievers is nothing but a fruitless effort","13:15":"Whatever is in the heavens and the earth do prostrate before Allah Alone willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the mornings and evenings","13:16":"Ask them: \"Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?\" If they hesitate to respond, say: \"Allah.\" Then ask them: \"When this is the fact, why do you take other deities, besides Him, who do not control any benefit or harm even to themselves, as your protectors?\" Say: \"Are the blind and the seeing equal? Or can darkness and light be equal?\" If that is not so, then, have their shoraka' (other deities they worship) created any thing like His creation which has made the matter of creation doubtful for them? Say: \"Allah Alone is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Irresistible","13:17":"He sends down water from the skies and each channel starts flowing according to its measure, and then the torrent bears a swelling foam - like the scum which appears from metal which are melted in the furnace for making ornaments and utensils. By such examples Allah depicts truth and falsehood. As for the scum, it is thrown away, being worthless, but that which is useful for the mankind remains behind on the earth. In this way Allah cites examples to make His message clear","13:18":"There is an excellent reward for those who respond to the call of their Lord. As for those who do not respond to Him - even if they had all that is in the earth, and as much besides, to offer as a ransom in order to save themselves from punishment, it would be of no use. They are the ones who will have terrible reckoning; their abode will be hell - what an evil resting place","13:19":"How can the one who knows that which has been revealed to you from your Rabb is the Truth, be like the one who is blind to this fact? Only those who use their common sense benefit from this reminder","13:20":"They are the ones who fulfill their covenant with Allah and do not break their pledge","13:21":"and they are the ones who join together what Allah has commanded to be joined, who fear their Rabb and are afraid of a terrible reckoning","13:22":"also thery are the ones who are patient, seek the pleasure of their Rabb, establish Salah, spend secretly and openly out of the sustenance which We have provided for them, and repel evil with good - they are the ones for whom there is the home of the hereafter","13:23":"the Paradise of perpetual bliss: they will enter into it along with their righteous forefathers, their spouses and their descendants. The angels will come to welcome them from every side","13:24":"saying: \"Peace be upon you for all that you steadfastly endured in the world. Now! How excellent will be the home of the hereafter","13:25":"As for those who break their covenant with Allah after confirming it and cut asunder what Allah has commanded to be joined and create mischief in the land, they are the ones on whom there shall be a curse and they are the ones who will have a terrible home","13:26":"Allah grants abundantly His provisions to whom He will and sparingly to whom He pleases. The unbelievers rejoice in the life of this world; but brief indeed is the comfort of this worldly life as compared to the life of the hereafter","13:27":"The unbelievers say: “Why has no sign been sent down to him (Muhammad) from his Rabb?” Say: “In fact Allah lets him go astray who wants, and guides to Himself those who turn to Him","13:28":"such are the ones who have believed and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of Allah. Beware! It is the remembrance of Allah which provides tranquility to the hearts","13:29":"As for those who believe and do good deeds, for them there will be prosperity and a beautiful place of final return","13:30":"O Muhammad! We have sent you among a nation before whom other nations have passed away, so that you may recite to them Our revelations which We have sent down to you; yet they are rejecting the Compassionate (Allah). Say: “He is my Rabb! There is no god but Him. In Him I have put my trust and to Him shall I return","13:31":"Even if there were a Qur’an that could move mountains, cleft the earth asunder or make the dead speak (do you think the result would have been different?) Surely all things are subject to Allah’s command. Have not yet the believers been satisfied that if Allah wanted, He would have certainly guided the whole of mankind? As for the unbelievers, the disaster will not cease to afflict them every now and then or to crouch at their very doorsteps because of their misdeeds, until the promise of Allah is fulfilled; surely Allah will not fail His promise","13:32":"Rasools have been mocked before you (O Muhammad), but I always gave respite to the unbelievers and finally I seized them, so see how terrible was My requital","13:33":"What! Are they so audacious that they ascribe partners to Allah, Who watches minutely over each and every soul and knows all that it does? O Prophet ask them: If Allah Himself has set them up as His partners, then tell me their names! Do you mean to inform Him of something new that He Himself does not know on this earth, or do you merely utter empty words?” Nay! Indeed their foul devices seem fair to the unbelievers, for they have been debarred from the Right Way; and there is none to guide those whom Allah has let go astray","13:34":"They shall be punished in the life of this world, still more grievous is the punishment of the hereafter, and there is none to protect them from Allah","13:35":"As for the paradise which the righteous have been promised, it is like this: rivers flow beneath it; eternal are its fruits, and eternal are its shades; such is the reward of the righteous. But the reward of unbelievers is the fire","13:36":"O Prophet, some of those to whom We have given the Book rejoice at what is revealed to you, while there are some factions who deny a part of it. Tell them: “I am commanded to worship Allah and to associate none with Him. To Him I invite you and to Him I shall return","13:37":"With these instructions, We have revealed this commandment in the Arabic language. Now, if you follow their vain desires after real knowledge has come to you, there will be none to save you or protect you against the wrath of Allah","13:38":"We have sent forth other Rasools before you and given them wives and children and it was never in the power of a Rasool to show any miracle without the sanction of Allah. For each period there was a Book","13:39":"Allah abrogates and confirms what He pleases - with Him is the Master Copy of the Book","13:40":"O Muhammad! Whether We let you see, within your lifetime, a part of what We threaten them with or cause you to die before We smite them, your mission is only to deliver the Message and it is for Us to take accountability","13:41":"Do they not see that We are gradually reducing the land in their control through curtailing its borders? When Allah commands, there is none to reverse His command and He is swift in taking accountability","13:42":"Those unbelievers who have passed before them also devised plots; but Allah is the Master of all planning.

Then Allah leaves in error whom He will and guides whom He pleases: He is the Mighty, the Wise","14:5":"We sent Moses with Our signs, saying: \"Lead your people out of utter darkness into light, and remind them to learn lessons from the Days of Allah (Divine history).\" Surely there are signs in this for every steadfast, thankful person","14:6":"Recall!

We shall certainly endure your persecution patiently, and those who want to put their trust, should put their trust in Allah","14:13":"Finally the unbelievers said to their Messengers: \"Return to our religion or we will expel you from our land.\" But their Lord revealed His will to them: \"We shall destroy the wrongdoers","14:14":"and give you the land to dwell in after they are gone!

As a result, Allah made its residents taste the consequences of their doings, through inflicting upon them misfortunes of hunger and fear","16:113":"A Messenger was sent to them from among themselves, but they denied him; so the punishment overtook them because they were wrongdoers","16:114":"So eat of the good and lawful things which Allah has provided for you; and be grateful to Allah for His favors, if you are sincere in His worship","16:115":"He has only forbidden you to eat carrion (meat of a dead body), blood, pork, and that over which any name other than Allah's has been invoked. But if one is forced by necessity, intending neither to break the Divine Law nor to transgress limits, then surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","16:116":"You shall not falsely declare with your tongues: \"This is lawful, and that is forbidden,\" in order to ascribe false things to Allah, for those who forge lies against Allah will never prosper","16:117":"Brief is their enjoyment of this life, and they shall have a painful punishment","16:118":"To the Jews, We prohibited those things which We have already mentioned to you, and it was not We Who imposed the hardships on them but they imposed those hardships on themselves","16:119":"Yet your Lord is forgiving and merciful towards those who do something wrong through ignorance, but later repent and mend their ways","16:120":"In fact Abraham was a nation in himself, an upright man obedient to Allah, and he was not of the pagans","16:121":"He was always grateful for the favors of Allah, Who chose him and guided him to the Right Way","16:122":"We gave him a good life in this world, and in the hereafter he will be among the righteous","16:123":"And now We have revealed to you Our will, saying: \"Follow the faith of Abraham the upright, he was not of the pagans","16:124":"As for the Sabbath, it was ordained for those who differed about its observance. Surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment about that over which they differ","16:125":"Call people to the Way of your Lord with wisdom and best advice, and reason with them, if you have to, in the most courteous manner: for your Lord knows best who strays from His Way and He knows best who is rightly guided","16:126":"If you have to retaliate, let your retaliation be commensurate with the wrong which was done to you; but if you endure with patience, the best reward indeed is for those who endure with patience","16:127":"Be patient - for your patience is not but with the help of Allah - do not grieve over them and do not distress yourself because of their plots","16:128":"for Allah is with those who fear Him and adopt the righteous attitude","17:1":"Glory be to Him Who took His devotee (Muhammad) one night from Masjid-al-Haram (in Mecca) to Masjid-al-Aqsa, whose vicinity We have blessed, so that We may show him some of Our signs: surely He is the One Who is the Hearer, the Observer","17:2":"We gave Moses the Book and made it a guide for the Children of Israel, saying: \"Do not take any other protector besides Me","17:3":"You are the descendents of those whom We carried in the Ark with Noah, and he was indeed a grateful devotee","17:4":"Besides this We forewarned the Children of Israel in their Holy Book that you will do mischief in the land twice through becoming arrogant transgressors and each time you will be punished","17:5":"When the promise for the first of the two fore warnings came to be fulfilled, We sent against you Our servants (the Assyrians) who gave you a terrible warfare: so they rampaged through your homes to carry out the punishment of which you were forewarned","17:6":"Then after this, We afforded you an opportunity to overpower them and helped you with wealth and sons and granted you more manpower","17:7":"If you did good, it was to your own benefit; but if you did evil, it proved to be bad for your own selves. Then, when the promise for your second forewarning came to be fulfilled, We sent another army (the Romans) to disfigure your faces and to enter your Temple as the former had entered it before, and they utterly destroyed all that they laid their hands on","17:8":"Now your Lord may again be merciful to you; but if you repeat the same behavior, We will repeat the punishment, and in the hereafter, We have made hell a prison for such unbelievers","17:9":"Surely this Qur’an guides to the Way which is perfectly straight and gives the good news to the believers who do good that they shall have a magnificent reward","17:10":"and at the same time it gives warnings to those who do not believe in the hereafter, that We have prepared for them a painful punishment","17:11":"Yet man prays for evil as fervently as he ought to pray for good, and mankind is ever hasty","17:12":"We have made the night and the day as two signs. We enshrouded the night with darkness and gave light to the day, to enable you to seek the bounty of your Lord, and that you may compute the years and count the numbers.

Today you yourself are sufficient to take your own account","17:15":"He that seeks guidance, shall be guided to his own advantage, but he that goes astray does so to his own loss. No bearer shall bear the burden of another on the Day of Judgment. And during your worldly life, We do not inflict punishment until We send forth a Messenger to make truth distinct from falsehood","17:16":"Whenever We have intended to destroy a town, it was because We sent Our commandments to its people who were leading easy lives but they showed disobedience; as a result Our Judgment was passed, and We razed that city to the ground","17:17":"How many generations have We destroyed since Noah’s time? Sufficient is your Lord to note and see the sins of His servants","17:18":"He that desires the transitory things of this life, We readily grant him such things as We please to whomsoever We want, then We condemn him to hell, where he will burn, disgraced and rejected","17:19":"He that desires the life of the hereafter and strives for it as best as he can provided he is a Believer, the endeavor of every such person will be accepted","17:20":"We bestowed on all - these as well those - out of the bounties of your Lord; the bounties of your Lord are not confined","17:21":"See how We have exalted some over others, and certainly the hereafter is more exalted and greater in excellence","17:22":"Do not associate another deity with Allah, lest you sit back, condemned, forsaken","17:23":"Your Lord has decreed to you that: You shall worship none but Him, and you shall be kind to your parents; if one or both of them live to their old age in your lifetime, you shall not say to them any word of contempt nor repel them and you shall address them in kind words","17:24":"You shall lower to them your wings of humility and pray: \"O Lord!

Has your Lord preferred to give you sons and adopted angels as daughters for Himself? Certainly you are uttering a monstrous statement","17:41":"We have explained things in various ways in this Qur’an so that they may receive admonition, yet it has only added to their aversion","17:42":"Tell them: If there were other gods besides Him as the pagans say, they would have certainly tried to find a way to dethrone the Master of the Throne","17:43":"Glory be to Him! He is far above the things that they say about Him","17:44":"The seven heavens, the earth and all beings therein declare His glory.

When in the Qur’an you mention His Oneness, they turn their backs in disgust","17:47":"We are quite aware what they really wish to hear when they listen to you, and what they say when they converse in private. These wrongdoers say to one another: \"The man you follow is surely bewitched","17:48":"See what sort of examples they make up about you! They have surely gone astray and cannot find the Right Way","17:49":"They say: \"What! When we are reduced to bones and dust, shall we really be raised up again into a new creation","17:50":"Tell them: \"(Yes, most certainly you shall be brought back to life), even if you be stones or iron","17:51":"or even something harder than this that you may think of.\" Then they will ask: \"Who will restore us?\" Say: \"The One Who created you the first time.\" Then they will shake their heads at you and ask: \"Well, when will this be?\" Say, \"It may be quite soon","17:52":"It will be on the Day when He will call you and you will raise up in response to it, with His praise, and you will think that you remained in the state of death but a little while","17:53":"Tell My servants that they should speak only what is the best. Surely Satan stirs up trouble among them. The fact is that Satan is an open enemy to mankind","17:54":"Your Lord is fully aware of your circumstances. He may be merciful to you if He wants, or He may punish you if He pleases. O Prophet, We have not sent you to be their guardian","17:55":"Your Lord is fully aware of all that is in the heavens and in the earth. We have exalted some prophets above the others and gave Zaboor (the Psalms) to David","17:56":"Say: \"Pray if you will to those whom you assert besides Him; they have neither the power to relieve you from any distress nor to change it","17:57":"Those to whom they pray, themselves seek the means of access to their Lord - trying as to who can be more near - they hope for His Mercy and fear His punishment, for the punishment of your Lord is terrible indeed","17:58":"There is not a town but We shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment; this fact has been recorded in the Eternal Record","17:59":"We refrain from sending signs (miracles) only because the men of former generations treated them as false. For example, We sent the she-camel to the people of Thamud - a manifest sign - but they laid violent hands on her. We send the signs only by way of warning, and if people reject the sign after receiving it, they are doomed","17:60":"Remember, O Muhammad! We told you that your Lord encompasses mankind. We have made the Vision which We showed you, and the cursed tree of Zaqqum which is mentioned in the Qur’an, a test for these people of Mecca. We are giving them warning to be fearful but it only increases their inordinate transgression","17:61":"Recall the occasion when We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam.\" They all prostrated except Iblees (Satan), who replied: \"Should I prostrate to the one whom You have created from clay","17:62":"Then he asked: \"Tell me, is this the one whom You have honored above me?

Hell is your reward, and the reward of those who follow you, an ample reward it shall be","17:64":"You may try to allure whomsoever you can with your seductive voice, muster against them all your cavalry and infantry, be their partner in their riches and their children, and promise them what you will - the promises of Satan are nothing but deception","17:65":"as for My servants, you shall have no authority over them. Your Lord is sufficient as their Guardian","17:66":"Your Lord is the One Who drives your ships across the ocean, so that you may seek His bounty; indeed He is ever Merciful to you","17:67":"Whenever any adversity strikes you at sea, all those to whom you pray besides Him forsake you except He; yet when He brings you safe to the land, you turn your backs upon Him. Indeed, man is ever ungrateful","17:68":"Are you confident that He will not cave in the land beneath you, or let loose a deadly tornado upon you? Then you may not find anyone to protect you","17:69":"Or, are you confident that when again you go back to sea He will not smite you with a violent tempest and drown you for your thanklessness? If that happens, then you will not find anyone who can question Us regarding this end of yours","17:70":"It is Our favor that We have honored the children of Adam, blessed them with conveyances on land and sea, provided them with good and pure things and exalted them above many of Our creatures","17:71":"Just imagine the scene of that Day when We shall call every community with their respective Imams (leaders): then those who will be given their ‘book of deeds’ in their right hand will read it with pleasure and they will not be wronged in the least","17:72":"But those who have played blind in this world will be blind in the hereafter, rather worse than blind in finding the Way to Salvation","17:73":"O Muhammad! These people have tried to entice you from Our revelations, hoping that you might fabricate something in Our name. Had you done that, they would have made you their friend","17:74":"Had We not strengthened your faith, you might have made some compromise with them","17:75":"In such a case We would have given you double punishment in this life and in the life hereafter. Then you would have found no helper against Our wrath","17:76":"They almost scare you off the land, to expel you from it. If they do so, they will not be able to stay here much longer after you","17:77":"This has always been Our Sunnah (course of action) with regards to those Messengers whom We sent before you, and you will find no change in Our Sunnah (course of action)","17:78":"Establish Salah from the decline of the sun till the darkness of the night (Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Isha) and read at Fajr (dawn); for the reading at Fajr is witnessed (by the angels)","17:79":"During a part of the night, pray Tahajjud, an additional prayer for you (O Muhammad), very soon your Lord may exalt you to ‘Maqam-e-Mahmood’ (a station of great glory)","17:80":"During the prayer say: \"Lord! Make my entrance, the entrance with truth and make my exit, the exit with truth and grant me a supporting authority from your presence","17:81":"and declare, \"The Truth has come and falsehood has vanished, for falsehood by its nature is bound to perish","17:82":"We have revealed the Qur’an which is a healing and a mercy to the believers, while to the wrongdoers it adds nothing but loss","17:83":"Man is a strange creature: when We bestow Our favors on man, he turns his back and drifts off to one side (instead of coming to Us) and whenever evil touches him, he gives himself up to despair","17:84":"O Prophet say to them: \"Everyone acts according to his own disposition; but only your Lord knows best who is on the Right Way","17:85":"They put you questions about Ar-Ruh (the Spirit). Tell them: \"The Spirit is at my Lord’s command and I am not given any knowledge of it but a little","17:86":"If We want, We can definitely take away all that which We have revealed to you: then you will find none to help you in getting it back from Us","17:87":"But your Lord has blessed you with this knowledge; surely His goodness to you has been great indeed","17:88":"Declare: \"Even if all human beings and Jinns combined their resources to produce the like of this Qur’an, they would never be able to compose the like thereof, even if they backed up each other as best as they could","17:89":"In this Qur’an We have used different methods to make the people understand the Message, yet the majority of them persist in unbelief","17:90":"They say: \"We will not believe in you until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us","17:91":"or until a garden of date-palms and grapes be created for you and you cause rivers to flow in it","17:92":"or until you cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces as you have threatened us; or you bring Allah and the angels before us face to face","17:93":"or a house made with gold comes into being for you; or you ascend to the sky - we shall not even believe in your ascendance until you bring down to us a book that we can read.\" O Muhammad, tell them: \"Glory be to my Lord! Have I ever claimed to be anything more than a human Messenger","17:94":"Nothing prevented people from belief when guidance came to them except the excuse: \"What! Has Allah sent a man like us to be a Messenger","17:95":"O Muhammad, tell them: \"Had there been in the earth angels walking about as settlers, We would certainly have sent down to them an angel from heaven as a Messenger","17:96":"Say: \"Sufficient is Allah as a witness between me and you. He is the One Who is Aware and Observant of His servants","17:97":"Those whom Allah guides are rightly guided; and those whom He lets go astray, shall find no protector besides Him. On the Day of Judgment We shall gather them all, prone on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf. Hell shall be their abode: whenever its flames die down, We will rekindle for them the fierceness of the fire","17:98":"Thus shall they be rewarded: because they rejected Our revelations and said: \"When we are reduced to bones and decayed particles, shall we really be raised to life in a new creation","17:99":"Can they not see that Allah Who has created the heavens and the earth has power to create the people like them? He has set a deadline for their lives, there is no doubt about it: yet the wrongdoers refuse to do anything except deny","17:100":"Say to them: \"Even if you had all the treasures of my Lord’s blessings at your disposal, you would still hold them back for fear of spending. Man is ever so stingy","17:101":"To Moses We gave nine clear signs. Ask the Children of Israel how, when he came to them and Pharoah told him: \"O Moses! I think that you are bewitched","17:102":"Moses replied: \"You know it very well that no one except the Lord of the heavens and the earth has sent down these signs as eye-openers, and O Pharoah (Pharaoh), surely I think that you are doomed","17:103":"So Pharoah resolved to remove Moses and the Israelites from the face of the earth, but We drowned him and all who were with him","17:104":"Thereafter We said to the Children of Israel: \"Settle down in the land and when the promise of the hereafter comes to be fulfilled, We shall assemble you all together","17:105":"We have revealed the Qur’an in Truth, and with the Truth it has come down: and O Muhammad, We have sent you only to give good news to the believers and to warn the unbelievers","17:106":"We have divided the Qur’an into sections so that you may recite to the people with deliberation, and We have sent it down in gradual revelations to suit particular occasions","17:107":"Say: \"Whether you believe in it or not, it is true that those who were endowed with knowledge before its revelation prostrate themselves when it is recited","17:108":"and say, ‘Glory be to our Lord! Our Lord’s promise has been fulfilled","17:109":"They fall down upon their faces, weeping as they listen, and this increases their reverence","17:110":"O Prophet, say to them: \"Whether you call Him Allah or call Him Rahman; it is all the same by whichever name you call Him because for Him are all the Finest names.

They speak nothing but a lie","18:6":"O Muhammad! You probably will kill yourself in grief over them, if they do not believe in this Message (The Qur'an)","18:7":"We have decked the earth with all kinds of ornaments to test the people and to see which of them do the best deeds","18:8":"In the end We shall reduce all that is on it to a barren wasteland","18:9":"Do you think that the Companions of the Cave and of Ar- Raqeem (this may refer to the name of their dog, or the tablet on which their names were inscribed or the mountain in which the cave is situated) were among Our wonderful signs","18:10":"When those young men took refuge in the cave, they said \"Our Lord! Have mercy on us from Yourself and guide us out of our ordeal","18:11":"So We put upon their ears a cover (put them into a deep sleep) for a number of years in the cave","18:12":"and then awakened them to find out which of the two parties (believers and nonbelievers who were arguing about the fact of life after death) could best tell the length of their stay","18:13":"Now We tell you their real story. They were young men who believed in their Lord, and on them We had bestowed Our guidance","18:14":"We put courage in their hearts when they stood up and declared: \"Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, we shall never appeal to any other deity except Him, for if we do, we shall be saying something improper","18:15":"These people of ours have taken for worship other gods besides Him; if they are right, why do they not bring forth any convincing proof of their divinity? Who is more wicked than the one who invents a lie about Allah","18:16":"Then in their mutual consultation they said: Now that we have withdrawn from them and denounced those deities whom they worship beside Allah, let us take refuge in some cave; our Lord will extend to us His mercy and facilitate us in disposing of our affairs","18:17":"If you could look at them in the cave, it would appear to you that the rising sun declines to the right of their cavern, and as it sets, passes them on the left, while they lay in an open space in between. This is from the signs of Allah. He whom Allah guides is rightly guided; but he whom He lets go astray, you will find no guardian to lead him to the Right Way","18:18":"If you could see them, you might have thought them awake, though they were asleep. We turned them about to their right and left sides, while their dog lay stretched out with his forepaws at the entrance. Had you looked at them you would have certainly turned your back and their sight would have made you flee in terror","18:19":"In the same miraculous way We woke them up from sleep so that they could question one another. One of them asked: \"How long have you been here?\" The others answered: \"Maybe we have been here for a day or part of a day.\" Finally they concluded: \"Our Lord knows best how long we have stayed here. Anyhow let one of us go to the city with this silver coin, and let him find who has the purest food and bring us something to eat. Let him behave with caution and let him not disclose our whereabouts","18:20":"For if they find you out, they will stone you to death, or force you back into their faith and in that case you will never attain felicity","18:21":"Thus did We reveal their secret to the people so that they might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about the coming of the Hour of Judgment. (But what a pity that instead of considering the Hour of Judgment) they started arguing among themselves about the companions of the cave. Some said: \"Erect an edifice over their remains.\" Their Lord is quite aware of them. Those who finally prevailed over their matter said: \"Let us erect a place of worship over them","18:22":"Now some will soon say: \"They were three and their dog was the fourth.\" The others will guess: \"They were five and their dog was the sixth,\" and there are still others who will say: \"They were seven and their dog was the eighth.\" Say: \"My Lord Alone knows their number. None but a few really know their correct number.\" Therefore, do not enter into discussion with them about their number except in a cursory way, nor ask anyone about the companions of the cave","18:23":"Never say of anything \"I will certainly do it tomorrow","18:24":"without adding: \"If Allah wills!\" And if you forget to say this, then call your Lord to mind and say: \"I hope that my Lord shall guide me and bring me ever closer than this to the Right Way","18:25":"Some say they stayed in their cave three hundred years and some add another nine","18:26":"O Prophet, say: \"Allah knows best how long they stayed; He is the One Who knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth; sharp is His sight and keen His hearing! They have no protector besides Him and He does not let anyone share in His command","18:27":"O Prophet! Recite what has been revealed to you from the Book of your Lord: no one is authorized to change His Words and if you dare to make any change, you will find no refuge to protect you from Him","18:28":"Keep yourself content with those who call on their Lord morning and evening seeking His good pleasure; and let not your eyes turn away from them desiring the attraction of Worldly Life; nor obey the one whose heart We have permitted to neglect Our remembrance, who follows his own desires and goes to extremes in the conduct of his affairs","18:29":"O Prophet proclaim: \"This is the Truth from your Lord. Now let him who will, believe in it, and him who will, deny it.\" As for those who reject it, for such wrongdoers We have prepared a Fire whose flames will hem them in like the walls of a tent. When they cry for help, they will be showered with water as hot as molten brass, which will scald their faces. What a dreadful drink and what a horrible residence","18:30":"As for those who believe and do good deeds, rest assured that We do not waste the reward of him who does a good work","18:31":"They are the ones for whom there will be the Gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers flow; they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold; they will wear green garments of fine silk and rich brocade and they will recline on soft couches. What an excellent reward and what a beautiful residence","18:32":"O Prophet! Give them this parable. Once there were two men. To one of them We had given two gardens of grapevines surrounded with palm-trees and put between them land for cultivation","18:33":"Both of those gardens yielded abundant produce and did not fail to yield its best. We had even caused a river to flow between the two gardens","18:34":"He had abundant produce, he said to his companion while conversing with him: \"I am richer than you and my clan is mightier than yours","18:35":"When, having thus wronged his soul, he entered his garden and said: \"I do not think that this garden will ever perish","18:36":"Nor do I believe that the Hour of Judgment will ever come. Even if I am returned to my Lord, I will surely find even a better place than this","18:37":"His companion replied while still conversing with him: \"Do you disbelieve in Him Who created you from dust, from a drop of semen, and fashioned you into a perfect man","18:38":"As for myself, Allah is the One Who is my Lord and I do not associate anyone with Him","18:39":"When you entered your garden why did you not say: 'It is as Allah pleased; no one has power except Allah!' Though you see me poorer than yourself in wealth and children","18:40":"yet my Lord may give me a garden better than yours, and may send down thunderbolts from sky upon your garden, turning it into a barren wasteland","18:41":"Or its water may dry out and you may never be able to find it","18:42":"It so happened that all his fruit produce was destroyed and the vines tumbled down upon their trellises, so he wrung his hands with grief for all that he had spent on it. He cried: \"I wish I had not associated anyone with my Lord","18:43":"He was so helpless that he could neither find anyone to help him besides Allah, nor could he himself avert that catastrophe","18:44":"it was then that he realized that the real protection comes only from Allah. His is the best reward and His is the best requital","18:45":"O Prophet! Give them the similitude of the life of this world. It is like the vegetation of the earth that flourishes with the rain from the sky, but afterwards the same vegetation turns into dry stubble which is blown away by the winds. Allah is the One Who has power over everything","18:46":"Likewise, wealth and children are an attraction of this worldly life; yet honorable deeds that last forever are better rewarded by your Lord and hold for you a better hope of salvation","18:47":"You should prepare for that Day when We will set the mountains in motion and you will see the earth as a barren waste; when We shall assemble mankind all together, leaving not even a single soul behind","18:48":"They all will be brought before your Lord standing in rows and Allah will say: \"Well! You see that you have returned to Us as We created you at first: even though you claimed that We had not fixed any time for the fulfillment of this promise of meeting with Us","18:49":"Then the book of their deeds will be placed before them. At that time you will see the sinners in great terror because of what is recorded therein. They will say: \"Woe to us! What kind of a book is this? It leaves out nothing small or large: all is noted down!\" They will find all that they did recorded therein. Your Lord will not be unjust to anyone in the least","18:50":"When We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourself before Adam,\" all prostrated themselves except Iblees (Satan), who was one of the Jinns and chose to disobey the command of his Lord. Would you then take him and his children as your protectors rather than Me, even though they are your enemies? What a bad substitute the wrongdoers have chosen","18:51":"I did not call them to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation, nor do I take those who lead mankind astray as My supporters","18:52":"On the Day of Judgment Allah will say to them: \"Call on those whom you thought to be My partners.\" They will call them but will receive no answer; and We shall cause animosity between them","18:53":"The criminals will see the fire and realize that they are going to fall into it; but will find no place to escape","18:54":"We have given all kinds of examples in this Qur’an to make the people understand this Message, but man is exceedingly contentious","18:55":"Nothing can prevent men from believing and seeking the forgiveness of their Lord now that Guidance has come to them, unless they are waiting for the fate of former peoples to overtake them or the scourge to be brought to them face to face","18:56":"We send the Messengers only to proclaim good news and to give warnings but with false arguments the unbelievers seek to defeat the Truth, through mocking at My revelations and My warnings","18:57":"Who is more unjust than the one who, when reminded of the revelations of his Lord, turns away from them and forgets what his own hands have done? In regards to such people, We have cast veils over their hearts, so they do not understand this Qur’an, and have become hard of hearing. Call them as you may towards the guidance, they will never be guided","18:58":"Your Lord is Most Forgiving, the Lord of Mercy. Had it been His Will to seize them for their sins, He would have hastened their punishment, but for that there is an appointed time, after which they will not find any refuge","18:59":"All those nations whom We destroyed for their wrongdoings were given respite and an appointed time for their destruction","18:60":"Now tell them about the story of Khizr to whom Allah has given special knowledge. The Prophet Moses was asked to go to him and learn from him. When Moses set out to meet him at an appointed place, he said to his young servant: \"I will not give up my journey until I reach the junction of the two rivers, even if I have to spend ages in travel","18:61":"It so happened that when at last they reached the junction of the two rivers they forgot about the fish they were carrying, which made its way into the river, and disappeared","18:62":"When they had passed on some distance, Moses asked his young servant: \"Let us have our breakfast, really we are worn out with this travelling","18:63":"He replied: \"You know! I forgot to tell you about the fish, which made its way miraculously into the river, when we were resting beside that rock. It was Satan who made me forget to mention this incident to you","18:64":"Moses said: \"That is the place we were looking for,\" so they went back retracing their footsteps","18:65":"There they found one of Our servants (Khizr) whom We had blessed with special favor from Ourselves and whom We had given special knowledge of Our own","18:66":"Moses requested of him: \"May I follow you so that you may teach me from that True Knowledge which you have been taught","18:67":"He answered: \"Surely you will not be able to bear with me","18:68":"for how can you have patience about that which is beyond your knowledge","18:69":"Moses said: \"If Allah wills, you shall find me patient and I shall not disobey you in any way","18:70":"He said: \"If you want to follow me, then do not question me about anything until I tell you about it myself","18:71":"So they set forth, but when they embarked in a boat to cross the river, Khizr made a hole in it. Moses cried out: \"Did you make a hole in it to drown its passengers? You have done a weird thing","18:72":"He said: \"Didn’t I say that you would not manage to have patience with me","18:73":"Moses said: \"Pardon my forgetfulness, do not be angry with me on account of this mistake","18:74":"So they journeyed on until they met a boy, and Khizr slew him. Moses said: \"You have killed an innocent person though he had killed nobody. Surely you have done a horrible deed","18:75":"Khizr said: \"Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me","18:76":"Moses replied: \"If ever I ask you about anything after this, you may not keep me in your company; for then I should deserve it because you will have an excuse in my case","18:77":"They travelled on until they came to the people of a town. They asked them for some food, but they refused to receive them as their guests. There they found a wall on the point of falling down, so he restored it. Moses said: \"If you wanted you could have demanded some payment for it","18:78":"Khizr replied: \"That's it, this is the parting between you and me. But first I will explain to you those acts of mine which you could not bear to watch with patience","18:79":"As for the boat, it belonged to some poor fishermen who toiled on the river. I intended to damage it because in their rear there was a king who was seizing every boat by force","18:80":"As for the youth, his parents are true believers, and we feared lest he would grieve them with his rebellion and unbelief","18:81":"It was our wish that our Lord should grant them another in his place, a son more righteous and better in affection","18:82":"As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and beneath it their treasure was buried. Since their father was a righteous man, your Lord desired that these children should attain their maturity and take out their treasure. All this was done as a mercy from your Lord. What I did was not done by my own will. That is the interpretation of those actions which you could not bear to watch with patience","18:83":"O Muhammad, they ask you about Zul-Qarnain. Say \"I will recite to you some of his story","18:84":"Indeed We established his power in the land and We gave him all kinds of ways and means","18:85":"So one time he followed a certain expedition towards the West and he marched on","18:86":"till he reached the end of the land and the start of an ocean, where the Sun was setting, he noted that it was setting in a mucky spring and found by it a people. We said: \"O Zul-Qarnain! You have the option to either punish them or to show them kindness","18:87":"He said: \"Anyone Who will do wrong shall be punished; then will he return to his Lord and be sternly punished by Him","18:88":"As for him who believes and does good deeds, he will have a good reward and will be assigned an easy task by our command","18:89":"Then he set out on another expedition towards the East and marched on","18:90":"till he came to the rising of the Sun, he noted it rising on a people for whom We had not provided any shelter from it (they were so backward that they did not even know how to make houses or tents for their living)","18:91":"He left them as they were: We had full knowledge what priority was before him","18:92":"Then he set out on another expedition and marched on","18:93":"till he reached between two mountains where he found a people who could hardly understand his language","18:94":"They requested: \"O Zul-Qarnain! People of Gog and Magog ravage this land; should we pay you tribute in order for you to build a wall-barrier between us and them","18:95":"Zul-Qarnain said: \"That which my Lord has granted me is more than enough, just help me with worker-force and I will erect a fortified barrier between you and them","18:96":"Bring me panels of iron.\" Finally when he had dammed up the space between the two mountains, he said: \"Ply your bellows.\" They did so until the iron wall became red hot, then he said: \"Bring me some molten brass to pour over it","18:97":"This became such a barrier that Gog and Magog could not scale it or to dig through it","18:98":"He said: \"This is a blessing from my Lord. But you should know that when the promise of my Lord shall come to pass, He will level it to the ground, for the promise of my Lord is ever true","18:99":"On that Day We shall let the people loose to surge like waves on one another. The trumpet will be blown and We shall assemble the mankind all together","18:100":"We shall spread Hell out on display before the unbelievers","18:101":"who had turned a blind eye to My admonition and a deaf ear to My warning","18:102":"Do the unbelievers think that they can take my servants as protectors, to save themselves from Hell, instead of Me? Certainly We have prepared Hell for the entertainment of such unbelievers","18:103":"O Muhammad tell them: \"Should we tell you the worst kind of losers relating to their deeds","18:104":"Those whose all efforts in this worldly life had gone astray from the Right Way, but all along they were under the delusion that they were doing good deeds","18:105":"they are the ones who are disregarding the revelations of their Lord and the fact that they will meet Him for accountability of their deeds in the Hereafter, so their deeds will become null and will not carry any weight on the Day of Judgment","18:106":"Thus the reward of such people will be Hell; because they had no faith and because they took My revelations and My Messengers as a joke","18:107":"However, those who believe and do good deeds, they will be entertained with the Gardens of Paradise","18:108":"to live therein for ever and they will never desire to go anywhere else","18:109":"O Muhammad tell them: \"If the ocean were ink with which to write the words of my Lord, the ocean would surely be consumed before the words of my Lord are finished, even if We brought similar quantity of ink to replenish it","18:110":"O Muhammad, tell them: \"I am but a human being like you; the revelation is sent to me to declare that your God is One God; therefore, whoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him do good deeds and join no other deity in the worship of his Lord","19:1":"Kaf Ha' Ya' ‘Ayn Suad","19:2":"This is a reminder of blessings that your Lord bestowed on His servant Zakariya","19:3":"when he invoked his Lord in secret","19:4":"saying: \"O Lord!

Surely We give you the good news of a son, his name shall be John: a name that no one has had before him","19:8":"He asked: \"O Lord! How shall I have a son when my wife is barren and I have become impotent from old age","19:9":"The answer came: \"So shall it be. Your Lord says: ‘It shall not be a difficult task for Me, just as I created you before, when you were nothing at all","19:10":"Zakariya said \"O my Lord! Give me a Sign\".

Your Lord has provided a brook at your feet","19:25":"If you shake the trunk of this palm-tree, it will drop fresh ripe dates in your lap","19:26":"So eat, drink and refresh yourself. If you see anyone, tell him: `I have vowed a fast to Rahman (Allah), so I will not speak to anyone today’","19:27":"Carrying the baby, she came back to her people. They said: \"O Mary! You have brought something hard to believe","19:28":"O sister (a woman from the noble family) of Haroon!

Do not forge a lie against Allah by calling it a magic, lest He destroy you by a scourge; for whosoever forges a lie will indeed be disappointed","20:62":"Hearing this, they debated their case among themselves, whispering to one another","20:63":"Finally they said: \"These two (Moses and Haroon) are certainly expert magicians who intend to drive you out from your land with their magic and to do away with your best traditions","20:64":"Therefore, muster up all devices and face them with a united front.\" Finally when the day of confrontation came, Pharoah said: \" Whoever comes out victorious this day shall prevail","20:65":"The magicians said: \"O Moses! Will you throw down first or shall we","20:66":"Moses replied: \"Go ahead, throw down first.\" Suddenly it appeared to Moses as if their cords and staffs were moving about because of their magic","20:67":"and Moses conceived fear within himself","20:68":"We said: \"Do not be afraid! You will surely come out on top","20:69":"Throw that which is in your right hand. It will swallow up all that they have produced. What they have produced is nothing but a magician’s trick, and a magician can never succeed against a miracle no matter how skillful he may be","20:70":"When the magicians saw the serpent of Moses swallowing all their display, being professionals they knew that it was not magic, so the magicians humbled themselves by prostrating and said: \"We believe in the Lord of Haroon and Moses","20:71":"Pharoah said: \"How do you dare to believe in Him without my permission? This man must be your master, who taught you witchcraft. Well, I will cut off your hands and feet on alternate sides and crucify you on trunks of palm-trees; then you will know which one of us can give a more terrible and more lasting punishment","20:72":"The magicians replied: \"We can never prefer you, rather we prefer the miracle which we have witnessed and Him Who has created us. Therefore do whatever you will; you can only punish us in this worldly life","20:73":"As for us, we have believed in our Lord so that He may forgive us our sins and the magic you have forced us to practice. Better is the ever lasting reward of Allah","20:74":"Surely he who will come to his Lord as a sinner shall be consigned to Hell - wherein he shall neither die nor live","20:75":"While he who will come to Him as a believer and has done good deeds shall have the highest ranks","20:76":"Gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever; such is the reward of those who purify themselves from evil","20:77":"We sent Our revelation to Moses, saying: \"Set forth with my servants at night and strike a dry path for them through the sea without fear of being overtaken by Pharoah and without any fear while passing through the sea","20:78":"Pharoah followed them with his armies but the waters completely overwhelmed them and covered them up","20:79":"Thus Pharoah misled his people instead of guiding them aright","20:80":"O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, We fixed a time to grant you The Torah on the right side of Mount Tur and We sent down to you Manna (sweet dish) and Salva (quail meat)","20:81":"saying: \"Eat of the good things We have provided for your sustenance and do not transgress, lest you should incur My wrath, and whoever incurs My wrath, is surely bound to perish","20:82":"but the one who repents, becomes a believer, does good deeds and follows the Right Way shall be forgiven","20:83":"When Moses came to mount Tur, Allah said: \"But, why have you come with such a haste ahead of your people, O Moses","20:84":"He replied: \"They are close behind me, I hastened to You O Lord so that You may be pleased","20:85":"Allah said: \"Well, listen! We tested your people after you and the Samiri (Samaritan) has led them astray","20:86":"So Moses returned to his people in a state of anger and sorrow. He said: \"O my people! Did your Lord not make a gracious promise to you? Did my absence seem too long to you? Or was it to incur the wrath of your Lord that you broke your promise with me","20:87":"They replied: \"We broke the promise through no fault of ours. We were made to carry the burden of the peoples' ornaments and throw them into the fire, thus Samiri suggested, who threw in something","20:88":"and forged a calf in the shape of a body which produced the mooing sound. Then they cried out: 'This is your god and the god of Moses, but Moses forgot to mention it to you","20:89":"What! Could they not see that it did not respond to them and that it could neither harm them nor help them","20:90":"Haroon had already told them: \"O my people! This is but a test for you; for verily your Lord is the Rahman (Allah): so follow me and do as I command you","20:91":"They had replied: \"We will not abandon its worship until Moses’s return","20:92":"Then Moses addressed Haroon: \" O Haroon! What prevented you from following me, when you saw them going astray?* Why did you disobey me","20:93":"Haroon replied: \"O son of my mother! Do not seize me by my beard nor pull the hair of my head, in fact I was afraid lest you might say: 'You have caused a division, through civil war, among the Children of Israel and did not respect what I said, ‘to keep peace’","20:94":"Then Moses addressed Samiri: \"Now what you have to say about this, O Samiri","20:95":"He replied: \"I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful of dust from the footprint of the Messenger (Angel Gabriel) and threw it into the casting of the calf: thus did my soul prompt me","20:96":"Moses cursed him: \"Get out of here! Now through out your life, you will say to other people: 'Touch me not’; and you will not escape your appointed doom. Behold this god to whom you had become a devoted worshipper: we will burn it and scatter its ashes into the sea","20:97":"Then he addressed his people: \"O my people! Your only God is Allah, other than Whom there is no god. His knowledge encompasses every thing","20:98":"Then he addressed his people: \"O my people! Your only God is Allah, other than Whom there is no god. His knowledge encompasses every thing","20:99":"Thus do We relate to you, O Muhammad, some information of the past events; and indeed We have sent you this Reminder (The Qur’an) from Our Own Self","20:100":"Those who reject it, shall bear a heavy burden on the Day of Resurrection","20:101":"For ever shall they bear it, and it will be indeed a very evil burden to bear on the Day of Resurrection","20:102":"The Day, when the Trumpet will be blown and We shall assemble all the sinners, their eyes will turn blue with terror","20:103":"They shall murmur among themselves: \"You hardly lived ten days on earth","20:104":"We know fully well what they will say; the most careful estimator among them will say: \"No, you stayed no longer than a day","20:105":"They ask you as to what will happen to the mountains. Tell them: \"My Lord will crush and scatter them like a fine dust","20:106":"He will turn the earth into a plain leveled ground","20:107":"wherein you will not see neither any curve nor crease","20:108":"On that Day the people will follow the call of the Caller, no one will dare show any crookedness; their voices hushed before the Beneficent (Allah), and you shall hear nothing but the sound of the marching feet","20:109":"On that Day, no intercession will avail except the one to whom the Beneficent (Allah) shall grant permission and would like to give him a hearing","20:110":"He knows what is before them and what is behind them while they do not encompass any knowledge about Him","20:111":"Their faces shall be humbled before the Ever-Living, the Ever-existent (Allah). The one who is carrying the burden of iniquity will be doomed","20:112":"but the one who is a believer and does good deeds shall fear no tyranny or injustice","20:113":"Thus have we sent down this Qur’an in Arabic and clearly proclaimed in it some of the warnings so that they may take heed or that it may serve as a reminder to them","20:114":"High and exalted be Allah, the True King! Do not hasten to recite the Qur’an before its revelation is completely conveyed to you, and then say: \"O Lord! Increase my knowledge","20:115":"We had taken a covenant from Adam before, but he forgot. We did not find in him firm determination","20:116":"When We said to the angels \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam,\" they all prostrated themselves except Iblees (Satan), who refused","20:117":"Then We said: \"O Adam! This Satan is a real enemy to you and to your wife. Do not let him get you both out of Paradise and get you in trouble","20:118":"Here in Paradise you shall go neither hungry nor naked","20:119":"you shall neither suffer from thirst nor from the scorching heat","20:120":"But Satan seduced him saying: \"O Adam! Should I show you the Tree of Immortality and an everlasting kingdom","20:121":"They both ended up eating the fruit of the forbidden tree. As a result their private parts became apparent to them and they both began to cover themselves with the leaves from the Garden. Thus did Adam disobey His Lord and go astray","20:122":"Later on Adam repented and his Lord chose him, accepted his repentance and gave him guidance","20:123":"saying: \"Get down from here all of you (Adam, Eve and Iblees); you will remain enemies to one another, whenever there comes to you guidance from Me and whosoever will follow My guidance will neither go astray nor get into trouble","20:124":"but the one who will turn away from My reminder shall live a meager life and We shall raise him back to life as a blind person on the Day of Resurrection","20:125":"He will say: \"O Lord! Why have you raised me up blind here, while I was clear-sighted before","20:126":"Allah will say: \"Just as Our revelation came to you and you played blind; so are you blind today","20:127":"Thus do We reward the one who is a transgressor and does not believe in the revelations of his Lord. The punishment of the Hereafter is more terrible and more lasting","20:128":"Have these people not learned a lesson, that We have destroyed before them many generations in whose ruins they walk through? Certainly in these ruins there are Signs for people of understanding","20:129":"Had it not been already decreed by your Lord and a term for respite been appointed, they would have been punished","20:130":"Therefore be patient with what they say. Glorify your Lord with His praise before sunrise and before sunset, glorify Him during the hours of the night as well as at the ends of the day, so that you may find satisfaction","20:131":"Do not strain your eyes with envy regarding the worldly benefits We have bestowed on some among them, for with these We seek to test them, the lawful provision of your Lord is better and more lasting","20:132":"Enjoin Salah on your people and be diligent in its observance. We demand nothing of you; instead We provide you sustenance. Blessed shall be the end of the Righteous","20:133":"They say: \"Why does he (Muhammad) not bring us a Sign from His Lord?\" Has not a clear Sign (The Qur’an) come to them containing all the teachings of the former Scriptures","20:134":"Had We destroyed them as punishment before its revelation, they would have said: \"Our Lord! If only You had sent us a Messenger, we would certainly have followed Your revelations before being humiliated and disgraced","20:135":"Say: \"All are waiting: so wait if you will. Very soon you shall find out, who is following the Right Way and who has been rightly guided","21:1":"The Day of Accountability for mankind is getting closer and closer, yet they are heedless and are turning away from the admonition","21:2":"They listen with ridicule to each fresh warning that comes to them from their Lord and remain engaged in the sports","21:3":"Their hearts are preoccupied with worldly affairs; these wrongdoers say to each other in private: \"Is this man (Muhammad) not a human being like yourselves? Would you follow witchcraft with your eyes open","21:4":"Tell them: \"My Lord has knowledge of every word which is spoken in the heavens and the earth, and He hears all and knows all","21:5":"Rather, some of them say, \"this Qur’an is jumble of dreams!\" Others say: \"He has made it all up!\" And yet others say: \"He is a poet!\" Let him bring to us a sign as did the former Messengers","21:6":"The fact, however, is that even though We showed Signs to the prior people, not a single nation before them, which We destroyed, ever believed. Will they believe","21:7":"The Messengers which We sent before you, O Muhammad, were also human to whom We sent revelation. If you, O objectors, do not know this, then ask the people of the reminder (Jews and Christians)","21:8":"We did not give them bodies which could survive without food, nor were they immortal","21:9":"Then We fulfilled Our promise with them: We saved them and those whom We pleased, and destroyed the transgressors","21:10":"Now, O People, We have sent down to you a Book (The Qur’an) which deals with matters concerning yourselves; why don’t you understand","21:11":"How many nations We have destroyed because of their iniquities and replaced them by other nations","21:12":"When they felt that Our punishment was coming, they took to their heels and fled","21:13":"They were told: \"Do not run away. Return to your luxuries of life and to your homes, so that you may be asked questions","21:14":"They replied: \"Woe to us! Indeed we were wrongdoers","21:15":"They kept on repeating that statement till We mowed them down, leaving no spark of life in them","21:16":"Our creation of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them is not a game","21:17":"Had We meant to make it a play ground, We would have done it by Ourself, without giving you discretion to do right and wrong, had We ever done so","21:18":"Nay! We give falsehood a violent blow with the Truth to knock it out and behold! Falsehood vanishes away. Woe be to you, for all the false gods you have invented","21:19":"To Him belongs all that exists in the heavens and in the earth; and the angels, who are in His very presence, are not too proud to serve Him, nor do they feel wearied of His service","21:20":"They glorify Him night and day; and do not pause","21:21":"Have the earthly deities, that they have taken for worship, the power to raise the dead","21:22":"If there were other gods in the heavens or in the earth besides Allah, both the heavens and earth would have been in a state of disorder. Glory be to Allah, the Lord of the Throne, absolutely free is He from the falsehood that they attribute to Him","21:23":"He is accountable to none about what He does, but they are accountable to Him","21:24":"Even then, have they taken other deities for worship besides Him? Ask them: \"Show us your proof: here is this reminder (Al-Qur’an) for the people of my time and it also contains the reminder of those before me.\" But most of them have no knowledge of Reality, and that is why they have turned away","21:25":"The fact is that to every Messenger whom We sent before you, We revealed the same Message: \"There is no god but Me, so worship Me Alone","21:26":"In spite of receiving that message, they still say: \"The Beneficent (Allah) has offspring!\" Glory be to Him! The angels are but His honored servants","21:27":"They do not precede Him in speaking and they act according to His commandment","21:28":"He knows what is before them and what is behind them and they do not intercede except for the one whom He approves, and for fear of Him they tremble","21:29":"If any of them were to say: \"I am also a deity besides Him,\" We would send him to hell, thus shall We reward the wrongdoers","21:30":"Have not the unbelievers ever considered that the skies and the earth were once one mass, then We split them asunder? And We have created every living thing from water. Will they still not believe","21:31":"And We have planted mountains on earth lest it should tilt to one side with them (the weight of people) and We left between them open passages so that they may find the right direction","21:32":"And We have made the sky a safe canopy: yet they are heedless to these signs","21:33":"He is the One Who has created the night and the day and the sun and the moon: all (the celestial bodies) move swiftly in an orbit of their own","21:34":"O Muhammad, We have not granted immortality to any human before you: so if you are to die, will these unbelievers live forever","21:35":"Every soul is bound to have the taste of death. We are putting all of you to a test by passing you through bad and good conditions, and finally you shall return to Us","21:36":"When the unbelievers see you they do not take you but for one to be scoffed at, saying: \"Is this the one who talks against your gods?\" And they themselves deny the mention of the Compassionate (Allah)","21:37":"Man is a creature of haste (impatience). Soon I will show you My signs, therefore, you need not be impatient","21:38":"They ask: \"When will this promise be fulfilled if you are telling the truth","21:39":"They would not have asked this question if only the unbelievers knew the Day when they will be able to protect neither their faces from the fire of hell nor their backs, nor will they be helped","21:40":"Nay, it will come to them all of a sudden and overpower them so abruptly that they shall neither be able to avert it nor shall they get any respite","21:41":"As for their scoffing, the Messengers before you were also scoffed at; but their scoffers were hemmed in by the very thing at which they used to scoff","21:42":"Ask them, \"Who is there to protect you by night and by day from the wrath of the Compassionate?\" Yet they turn away from the admonition of their Lord","21:43":"Do they have such gods who can defend them against Us? Their gods can neither help themselves nor can they protect themselves from Us","21:44":"The fact is that We gave the good things of this life to them and their forefathers until they got used to these things because of their prolonged lives; can they not see how We gradually reduce the land which was in their control and curtail it from all sides? Do they still expect to be victorious against Us","21:45":"Tell them, \"I am warning you on the authority of Revelation,\" but the deaf choose not to listen the call when they are warned","21:46":"Yet even if a breath from the Wrath of your Lord was to touch them, they will certainly say, \"Woe to us! No doubt we were wrongdoers","21:47":"On the Day of Judgement We shall set up scales of justice so that no one will be dealt with unjustly in any way; even if someone has an act as small as a grain of a mustard seed, We will bring it to account, and sufficient are We to settle the accounts","21:48":"Certainly, We granted to Moses and Haroon (Aaron) the Criterion of right and wrong, a light and a reminder for those righteous people","21:49":"who fear their Lord though they have not seen Him, and dread the Day of Judgment","21:50":"And now We have revealed this blessed Reminder (The Qur’an). Will you then deny it","21:51":"Even before that We blessed Abraham with rectitude, for We knew him well","21:52":"Remember that occasion when Abraham asked his father and his people, \"What are these images to which you are so devoted","21:53":"They replied, \"We found our forefathers worshipping them","21:54":"He said \"Then certainly both you and your forefathers have been in manifest error","21:55":"They asked, \"Have you brought us the Truth or are you one of the triflers","21:56":"He replied, \"Nay! Your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. It is He Who has created them; and I am of those who bear witness to this","21:57":"By Allah! I will certainly plan against your idols when you turn and go away","21:58":"So he broke them all in pieces, except the biggest of them, so that they might turn to it","21:59":"(On their return when they saw the plight of their idols), some asked, \"Who has done this to our gods? He must surely be a wicked person","21:60":"Others replied, \"We heard a youth, called Abraham, talking about them","21:61":"They said, \"Then bring him here before the eyes of the people, so that they may witness how severely he is punished","21:62":"When Abraham came, they asked, \"O Abraham, are you the one who has done this to our gods","21:63":"He replied, \"Surely someone has done it; the chief of them, that is! Ask them, if they can speak","21:64":"Thereupon they turned to search their own consciences, and said to themselves, \"Surely you yourselves are the wrongdoers","21:65":"Confounded as they were, lowering their heads they said, \"You know fully well that they cannot speak","21:66":"At this Abraham said, \"Do you then worship these deities, instead of Allah, who can neither benefit nor harm you","21:67":"Shame on you and on those deities you worship besides Allah! Have you no sense at all","21:68":"They cried, \"Burn him alive and avenge your gods, if you want to take any action","21:69":"When they threw him in the fire, We commanded, \"O fire! Be cool and comfortable for Abraham","21:70":"They sought to harm him, but We made them the big losers","21:71":"We delivered him and his nephew Lot and directed them to the land which We have blessed for all the people of the world","21:72":"We gave him a son Isaac and then a grandson Jacob; and We made each of them a righteous man","21:73":"We made them leaders who guided other people by Our command and We sent them revelations to do good deeds, establish Salah and pay Zakah. To Us Alone did they serve","21:74":"To Lot We gave wisdom and knowledge, and We delivered him from the town which practiced abominations - surely its inhabitants were very wicked transgressors","21:75":"and We admitted him to Our mercy: for he was of the righteous people","21:76":"Before them Noah prayed to Us, We accepted his prayer and delivered him and his family from the great calamity","21:77":"We helped him against those people who had denied Our revelations; surely they were an evil people, so We drowned them all in the Great Flood","21:78":"We also bestowed favors upon Davidand Solomon: when the two were judging a case regarding the field into which the sheep of certain people had strayed by night, and We were watching them to arrive at judgment","21:79":"at that time We gave Solomon insight to arrive at the right decision, although We had given wisdom and knowledge to both of them. We caused the mountains and the birds to celebrate Our praises with David; it was We Who made this happen","21:80":"We taught him the armor’s craft, so that they might protect you in your wars: yet are you ever grateful","21:81":"We made the raging winds subservient to Solomon, pursuing its course by his command to the land which We had blessed; and We have knowledge of everything","21:82":"And We had subjected to him many of the Satans who dived for him into the sea and performed other duties besides this; and We were the One Who had control over them for him","21:83":"Similarly We blessed Job, when he prayed to his Lord saying, \"I am badly afflicted with disease: but of all those who show mercy You are the most Merciful","21:84":"We accepted his prayer and relieved his affliction, and restored not only his family but also as many more with them as a favor from Us so that it may serve as a reminder to Our worshippers","21:85":"Likewise, We blessed Isma‘il (Ishmael), Idris and Zul-kifl, for all of them practised patience","21:86":"We admitted them to Our Mercy, for they were of the righteous people","21:87":"We blessed Zun-nun (Jonah / Jonah), when he departed in anger, thinking We would not take him to task for this, but later he prayed to Us from the depths of darkness, \"There is no god but You, glory be to You! Indeed I was the one who committed wrong","21:88":"We accepted his prayer and delivered him from distress; thus do We deliver the believers","21:89":"We also blessed Zakariya, when he prayed to his Lord, \"O my Lord! Do not let me remain childless even though You are the best of inheritors","21:90":"We accepted his prayer and gave him John, curing his wife for him to bear a child. They were ever quick in emulating good deeds and called on Us with hope, fear, and submission","21:91":"And We blessed the woman (Mary), who guarded her chastity, We breathed into her of Our Spirit and We made her and her son a sign for the whole world","21:92":"Verily this brotherhood of yours is a single brotherhood and I am your only Lord, therefore worship Me Alone","21:93":"But the people have divided their religion into sects between them- to Us they shall all return","21:94":"Whoever shall do good deeds, provided he is a believer, his endeavor will not be rejected: We are recording it all for him","21:95":"It is not possible that a nation which We have destroyed may rise again","21:96":"Until, when Gog and Magog will be let loose and they will swiftly swarm from every height","21:97":"and the time of fulfillment for the True Promise will draw near, then behold! The eyes of the unbelievers will fixedly stare in horror: \"O woe to us! We were indeed heedless of this warning; nay we were wrongdoers","21:98":"Surely you (O pagans) and your deities that you worship besides Allah shall be the fuel of hell; therein you shall all enter","21:99":"If those deities would have been true gods, they would not have gotten there; but there they shall abide forever","21:100":"In there, sobbing will be their lot, and they will not be able to hear anything else","21:101":"Certainly those for whom the good reward from Us has preceded them will be kept far away from it","21:102":"They shall not hear even its slightest sound, and they shall dwell forever in the midst of whatever their souls desire","21:103":"The time of Great Terror (Day of Judgement) will not grieve them, and the angels will receive them with greetings: \"This is your Day that you were promised","21:104":"On that Day We shall roll up the heavens like a scroll of writings; just as We originated the first creation, so shall We produce it again - that is Our promise, and We will fulfill it","21:105":"We wrote this in The Zaboor (Psalms xxxvii, 29) after the reminder (Torah given to Moses): that as for the land, My righteous servants shall inherit it","21:106":"Surely in this is great news for those people who worship Us","21:107":"O Muhammad, We have not sent you but as a blessing for all the worlds","21:108":"Tell them: \"It has been revealed to me that your God is One God - will you then become Muslims","21:109":"If they give no heed, tell them: \"I have warned you all alike in complete fairness; now I do not know whether what you are threatened with is near or far","21:110":"It is He Who knows your spoken words and hidden thoughts","21:111":"I do not know whether this delay is a trial for you or you are being given respite for an appointed time","21:112":"Finally the Prophet said: \"O Lord! Pass Your Judgment with fairness. And O People! Our Lord is most Compassionate, Whose help we seek against the blasphemies you utter","22:1":"O mankind! Have fear of your Lord; the catastrophic quaking of the Hour of Doom will be terrible indeed","22:2":"On that Day you shall see that every nursing mother will forget her nursing-babe and every pregnant female will miscarry, and you will see people as if they are intoxicated, though they will not be drunk: such will be the horror of Allah’s chastisement","22:3":"Yet there are some among people, who in their ignorance, argue about Allah and follow every rebellious devil","22:4":"though they are doomed to seduce whoever takes them as their friends and lead him to the punishment of burning fire","22:5":"O mankind! If you doubt that there is life after death remember that We first created you from dust, then from a sperm, then from a leech- like mass, then from a morsel of flesh, partly formed and partly unformed, so that We may manifest to you Our power. We cause to remain in the womb whom We wish for an appointed term, and then We bring you forth as infants; then We nourish you so that you may reach your age of full strength. There are some of you who die young and some who live on to their abject old age when all that they once knew they know no more. You sometimes see the land dry and barren; but no sooner do We pour down rain upon it then it begins to stir and swell, putting forth every kind of beautiful growth in pairs","22:6":"This is because Allah is the Reality: it is He Who gives life to the dead and it is He Who has power over everything","22:7":"and this is a proof that the Hour of Doom is sure to come there is no doubt about it; and that Allah will raise up those who are in the graves","22:8":"Yet there are others among people who wrangle about Allah, though they neither have knowledge nor guidance, nor an enlightening Book","22:9":"twisting things around in order to lead others astray from the Path of Allah - for such persons there is disgrace in this life, and on the Day of Judgment we shall make them taste the punishment of burning fire","22:10":"saying: \"This is what you prepared and sent forth with your own hands.\" Rest assured that Allah is not unjust to His worshippers","22:11":"There are some people who worship Allah standing on the verge of faith (half faith and half disbelief). When such a person is blessed with good fortune he is content; but if he encounters a trial he turns back headlong; thus losing both this world and the Hereafter, which is a clear-cut loss","22:12":"Then instead of Allah, he starts calling those deities who can neither harm nor help him; now that is going too far off in deviation from the Right Way","22:13":"He is calling upon those who are more likely to harm than help; what an evil master and what an evil friend he chooses for help","22:14":"As for those who believe and do good deeds, Allah will admit them to gardens beneath which the rivers flow. Surely Allah does what He wants","22:15":"If anyone thinks that Allah will not help His Messenger in this world and in the Hereafter, let him stretch out a rope to the sky if he can and cut a hole to peep through and see for himself whether his device can avert that which irritates him","22:16":"Thus have We revealed this The Qur’an in clear verses; and verily Allah gives guidance to whom He wants","22:17":"Surely as for those who are true believers (the Muslims), the Jews, the Sabians, the Christians, the Magians and the ones who commit shirk (polytheists) - Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection; for Allah is a witness over everything","22:18":"Do you not see how all who dwell in the heavens and the earth bow down in worship to Allah, including the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the animals, and a large number of people, even a large number of those deserving the punishment. He who is humbled by Allah has none who can raise him to honor; surely Allah does what He pleases","22:19":"These are the two adversaries (the believers and disbelievers) who dispute with each other about their Lord: as for the disbelievers, garments of Fire will be cut out for them, boiling water will be poured over their heads","22:20":"which will not only melt their skins but also the inner parts of their bellies","22:21":"and there will be maces of iron to lash them","22:22":"Whenever, in their anguish, they try to escape therefrom, they will be forced back therein, and will be told: \"Taste the punishment of conflagration","22:23":"As for those who have faith and do good deeds, Allah will certainly admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow. They shall be decked with pearls and bracelets of gold, and their garments will be of silk","22:24":"This is because during their life on earth, they were guided to accept the pure words of Allah and they were shown the Way of the All-Praiseworthy","22:25":"As for those who are unbelievers and debar others from the Way of Allah and from the Masjid-al-Haram, to which We have assigned all mankind with equal rights whether they are natives or foreigners, and whoever intends to deviate from righteousness to wrongdoing in its vicinity, We will make him taste a painful punishment","22:26":"Remember! We identified the site of the Sacred House to Abraham, saying, \"Worship none besides Me, sanctify My House for those worshippers who make Tawaf (walking counterclockwise around it as a part of the Hajj rituals), and stand in prayer, bow, and prostrate themselves","22:27":"and make a proclamation of Hajj (Pilgrimage) to mankind: they will come to you on foot and on lean camels from every distant quarter","22:28":"so that they may witness the benefits which are made available here for them, and pronounce the name of Allah over the cattle which We have provided as food for them, on the appointed days, then eat meat themselves and feed the indigent and needy","22:29":"Then they should accomplish their needful acts of shaving or cutting their hair and taking a bath, fulfill their vows and go for Tawaf-e-Ziyarah to the Ancient House","22:30":"This was the object for which the Ka’bah was built, and whoever honors the sacred rites of Allah, it is good for him in the sight of his Lord. The meat of cattle is lawful to you, except what has already been mentioned to you; therefore, shun the abomination of idols and shun all false statements","22:31":"Dedicate yourselves to Allah and do not commit shirk with Him: for anyone who commits shirk, it is as though he had fallen from the sky; then his body is either snatched away by birds or carried away by the wind to some far-off place","22:32":"so it is, and he who respects the Symbols of Allah, surely shows the piety of his heart","22:33":"You may benefit (by using their milk) from the cattle dedicated for sacrifice, until the time of their slaughter, then their place of sacrifice is near the Ancient House","22:34":"For every nation We prescribed a way of sacrifice so that they may pronounce the name of Allah over the cattle which He has given them for food, your God is one God; so submit yourselves to Him as a Muslim, and give good news to the humble","22:35":"whose hearts tremble at the mention of Allah; who endure adversity with patience, who establish Salah and spend in charity out of what we have given them","22:36":"We have included the sacrificial camels among the Symbols of Allah, for there is much good for you in them. Therefore, pronounce the name of Allah over them while standing, and when they fall down on their sides after slaughter, then eat of their meat, feed the contented (poor who do not ask) and the beggars (poor who ask). Thus We have subjected these animals to you so that you may be grateful","22:37":"It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah; it is your piety that reaches Him. Thus, He has subjected these animals to you so that you may glorify Allah for giving you guidance, and O Prophet, give good news to those who do good to others","22:38":"Surely Allah wards off evil from those who are true believers: for certainly Allah does not love anyone who is treacherous, ungrateful","22:39":"Permission to fight back is hereby granted to the believers against whom war is waged and because they are oppressed; certainly Allah has power to grant them victory","22:40":"those who have been unjustly expelled from their homes only because they said, \"Our Lord is Allah.\" Had not Allah repelled some people by the might of others, the monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which Allah’s praise is daily celebra","22:41":"These are the people who, if We establish them in the land, will establish Salah and pay Zakah, enjoin justice and forbid evil; the final decision of all affairs is in the hands of Allah","22:42":"If they deny you O Muhammad, remember that before them the people of Noah, ‘Ad and Thamud","22:43":"the people of Abraham and Lot","22:44":"as well as the residents of Madyan had denied their Prophets, likewise Moses was also denied. Initially, I gave respite to all those unbelievers and then I seized them: see how terrible was My disapproval","22:45":"How many townships, teaming with wrong doings, have We utterly destroyed! Today they lie with their roofs fallen in, their wells abandoned, and their lofty castles deserted","22:46":"Have they not traveled through the land? Have they no hearts to learn wisdom, or ears to hear the Truth? Certainly it is not their eyes which are blind, but it is the hearts in their breasts which are blind","22:47":"These people ask you to hasten the threatened punishment. Well, Allah will never go back on His promise. In fact a day of your Lord (time period in which Allah's decision is executed) is equal to a thousand years of your calculation","22:48":"There have been many townships teeming with wrong doings, to whom at first I gave respite and at the end I smote them. Towards Me is the destination of all","22:49":"O Muhammad, tell them: \"O mankind! I am merely a plain Warner to you","22:50":"Those who accept the true faith and do good deeds shall be forgiven and provided honorable sustenance","22:51":"but those who strive against Our revelations, shall be the inmates of flaming fire","22:52":"Never have We sent a Messenger or a prophet before you, O Muhammad, with whose wishes Satan did not tamper; but Allah abrogates the interjections of Satan and confirms His own revelations, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise","22:53":"He makes Satan’s interjections a temptation for those whose hearts suffer from the disease of hypocrisy and whose hearts are hardened - that’s why the wrongdoers are in such an extreme dissension","22:54":"so that those who are endowed with knowledge may realize that this (Qur’an) is the Truth from your Lord and thus believe in it and humble their hearts towards Him, and surely Allah will guide the believers to the Straight Way","22:55":"As for the unbelievers, they will never cease to doubt the revelation, until the Hour of Doom overtakes them suddenly or there comes on them the punishment of the Day of Disaster","22:56":"On that Day the Kingdom will be that of Allah’s; He will judge between them; so those who have embraced the true faith and done good deeds shall enter the gardens of delight","22:57":"but the unbelievers who have denied Our revelations shall receive a disgraceful punishment","22:58":"As for those who migrated for the sake of Allah and afterwards were killed or died, Allah will make a generous provision for them; certainly Allah is the One Who is the best Provider","22:59":"He will admit them to a place with which they shall be well pleased; for Allah is All-Knowing, Most Lenient","22:60":"Thus shall it be! He that retaliates equal to the infliction he received and then is wronged again, will most certainly be helped by Allah; surely Allah is the One Who is All-Forbearing, Most Forgiving","22:61":"That is because it is Allah Who causes the night to pass into the day, and the day into the night, Allah is indeed All-Hearing, Most Observing","22:62":"That is because Allah is the One Who is Real; and all those deities besides Him, whom they invoke, are false; indeed it is Allah Who is the Supreme, the Great","22:63":"Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the sky so the land becomes green? Surely Allah is the Benignant, Aware","22:64":"To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth; surely Allah is the One Who is the Self-sufficient, the Praiseworthy","22:65":"Do you not see that Allah has subdued to you all that is in the earth and the ships that sail through the sea by His command? He is withholding the sky in a way that it cannot fall down on the earth without His permission; surely Allah is very kind and merciful to mankind","22:66":"He is the One Who has given you life, will cause you to die and then will bring you back to life again - yet man is indeed very ungrateful","22:67":"To every nation We have prescribed the rites of worship which they observe, therefore, let them not dispute with you concerning this matter - keep calling them to the Way of your Lord; for most surely you are rightly guided","22:68":"If they argue with you, say: \"Allah knows best all that you do","22:69":"Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning the matters in which you differ","22:70":"Do you not know that Allah is aware of all that is in heaven and the earth? Certainly all of this is recorded in a Book and it is very easy for Allah to do so","22:71":"Yet they worship besides Allah those deities for which He has revealed no sanction, nor they themselves have any knowledge about them; certainly the wrongdoers shall have no helper","22:72":"When Our revelations are recited to them with all their clarity, you can notice a denial on the faces of the unbelievers. They can barely restrain themselves from assaulting those who recite Our revelations. Say to them: \"Shall I tell you something which is far worse than that? It is the fire of hell, which Allah has promised to those who reject the truth; what an evil abode it will be","22:73":"O mankind! Here is an example for your understanding, so listen to it carefully. Those deities whom you call besides Allah, cannot create a single fly, even if they all combined their forces, rather, if a fly snatches away anything from them they cannot even get it back; how feebleminded are the suppliants and how powerless are those whom they supplicate","22:74":"They do not render to Allah the homage due to Him; in fact, Allah is the One Who is All-Powerful, All-Mighty","22:75":"Allah chooses His messengers from among the angels and from among the human beings, for surely Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing","22:76":"He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and to Allah shall all matters return for decision","22:77":"O believers! Bow down, prostrate yourselves, worship your Lord and do good deeds so that you may attain salvation","22:78":"Strive in the Way of Allah as you ought to strive with sincerity and discipline; He has chosen you and has not laid upon you any hardship in the observance of your faith - the faith of your father Abraham. He named you Muslims before in prior scriptures and in this (The Qur’an), so that His Messenger may testify against you and you yourselves may testify against rest of the mankind. Therefore, establish Salah, pay Zakah and hold fast to Allah, Who is your Protector - so what an excellent Protector and what a splendid Supporter","23:1":"Indeed successful are those believers","23:2":"who are humble in their Salah (prayers)","23:3":"who avoid vain talk","23:4":"who are punctual in the payment of Zakah (charity)","23:5":"who guard their private parts","23:6":"except with their spouses or those who are legally in their possession, for in that case they shall not be blamed","23:7":"however those who seek to go beyond that in lust are the ones who shall be the transgressors","23:8":"who are true to their trust and covenants","23:9":"and who are diligent about their Salah (prayers)","23:10":"These are the heirs","23:11":"who will inherit paradise; and live therein forever","23:12":"Indeed We have created man from an essence of clay","23:13":"then placed him as a drop of semen in a firm resting place","23:14":"then changed the semen into a leechlike mass, then leechlike mass into a fetus lump, then fetus lump into bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, and then We brought him forth as quite a different creature from the embryo - so blessed is Allah, the best of all creators","23:15":"Then after living for a while you shall all die","23:16":"then most surely you shall be raised to life again on the Day of Resurrection","23:17":"We have made seven avenues (heavens) above you; and We are never unmindful of Our creation","23:18":"We send down water from the sky according to a due measure, then We cause it to settle in the soil - you should know that if We please, We can certainly take it away","23:19":"then with it We cause to grow gardens of palm trees and grapes for you; yielding abundant fruit for you to eat","23:20":"and also a tree which grows on Mount Sinai which produces oil and relish as a food for those who like to eat it","23:21":"In cattle, too, there is a lesson for you: from within their bodies We produce milk for you to drink, besides this you gain numerous other benefits; some of them you eat","23:22":"yet on others as well as on ships you ride","23:23":"We sent Noah to his people. He said, \"O my people! Worship Allah, you have no other god but Him, are you not afraid of Him for committing shirk","23:24":"The chiefs of the unbelievers among his people said, \"Noah is but a human like you, he desires to assert his superiority over you. If Allah wanted to send Messengers, He could have sent down angels, we have never heard such a thing as he says from our forefathers","23:25":"Some of them said: \"He is just a madman, so bear with him for a while","23:26":"Noah said, \"O my Lord! Help me against their calling me a liar","23:27":"So We revealed Our will to him, saying: \"Build an ark under our supervision according to Our instructions; and when Our judgement comes to pass and water wells out from 'At-Tannur', take aboard a pair (a male and a female) from every species and take your family, except those of them against whom the judgement has already been passed; and do not plead with Me in favor of the wrongdoers, for they are doomed to be drowned in the flood","23:28":"Then when you have embarked on the ark with your companions, say: \"Praise be to Allah Who has delivered us from the nation of wrongdoers","23:29":"and pray, \"O my Lord! Bless my landing from this Ark, for You are the best to make my landing safe","23:30":"There are many lessons in this story, and surely We do test people","23:31":"Then We raised after them a new generation (the people of ‘Ad)","23:32":"and sent to them a Messenger (Hud) from among themselves, who said to them: \"Worship Allah! You have no other god except Him. Will you not fear Him for committing shirk","23:33":"But the chiefs of his people - who disbelieved the message and denied the life in the hereafter, - on whom We had bestowed affluence in this worldly life, said: \"This person is but a human like you; he eats of what you eat and drinks of what you drink","23:34":"If you obey a human like yourselves, you shall indeed be lost","23:35":"What! Does he claim that when you are dead and turned into dust and bones, you will be brought to life out of your graves","23:36":"Impossible! Just impossible is that with which you are being threatened with","23:37":"There is no other life but our life of this world: we live here and die here, and shall never be raised to life again","23:38":"This man is but an impostor, forging a lie against Allah, and we are not going to believe him","23:39":"At this the Messenger prayed: \"O my Lord! Help me against their calling me a liar","23:40":"Allah responded: \"After a short time they will surely be sorry","23:41":"So the Blast overtook them in all justice and We swept them away like the rubbish of dead leaves - so gone is the nation of wrongdoers","23:42":"After them We raised other generations","23:43":"no people can hasten their term nor can they postpone it","23:44":"and sent forth Our Messengers one after another: every time a Messenger came to his people, they disbelieved him, so We punished them one by one and made them a history; so gone is the nation of disbelievers","23:45":"Then We sent Moses and his brother Haroon (Aaron) with Our signs and clear authority","23:46":"to Pharoah (Pharaoh) and his chiefs: but they received them with arrogance for they were very haughty people","23:47":"They said: \"What! Should we believe in two human beings like ourselves, and whose people are our slaves","23:48":"So they disbelieved both of them and became among those who were destroyed","23:49":"And We gave Moses the Book, so that his people might be rightly guided","23:50":"And We made the son of Mary (Jesus) and his mother a sign for mankind, and gave them a shelter on a peaceful lofty ground, furnished with a fresh spring","23:51":"O Messengers!

Nay! In fact he has brought them the Truth and most of them dislike the Truth","23:71":"Had the Truth followed their appetites, the heavens, the earth and everything therein would have been disrupted. Nay! We have given them their reminder, but they are heedless to their reminder","23:72":"Or is it that you are asking them for some recompense? But the recompense of your Lord is the best, for He is the best provider of sustenance","23:73":"As a matter of fact, you (O Muhammad) are calling them to the Straight Way","23:74":"and surely those who do not believe in the hereafter will ever stray from the Straight Way","23:75":"If We show them mercy and relieve them of their affliction, they would obstinately persist in their rebellion, blindly wandering to and fro","23:76":"for even now, when We have inflicted punishment on them, they have neither submitted to their Lord nor humbled themselves towards Him","23:77":"Until when We open upon them a gate of severe punishment, you will see that they are plunged in utter despair","23:78":"It is Allah Who has given you ears, eyes and hearts - yet seldom you show gratitude","23:79":"it is He Who has placed you in the earth and before Him you shall all be assembled on the Day of Judgement","23:80":"It is He Who gives life and cause you to die, and in His control is the alternation of the night and the day: then why don’t you understand","23:81":"On the contrary they just say what their forefathers said before them","23:82":"who said: \"What! After death when our bodies become dust and bones, could we really be raised to life again","23:83":"We have heard many such threats and so did our forefathers before us. These are nothing but legends of primitive people","23:84":"Say: \"To whom belongs the earth and everything therein? Tell me if you know","23:85":"They will promptly reply: \"to Allah!\" Ask them: \"Then why you do not use your common sense and believe in Him","23:86":"Say: \"Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Glorious Throne","23:87":"Right away they will say: \"Allah.\" Ask them: \"Then why you do not fear Him","23:88":"Say: \"In whose hands is the sovereignty of all things, protecting all, while against Him there is no protection? Tell me if you know","23:89":"Quickly they will reply: \"Allah.\" Ask them: \"Then how can you be so bewitched","23:90":"The fact of the matter is that We have brought them the Truth, and undoubtedly these people are liars","23:91":"Never has Allah begotten a son, nor is there any god besides Him.

So you see, what was the end of those transgressors","27:15":"We bestowed knowledge on Davidand Solomon. They both said: \"Praise be to Allah Who has exalted us above many of His believing servants","27:16":"Solomon succeeded David. He said: \"O people! We have been taught the language of birds and given all sort of things.

Inspire me to render thanks for Your favors, which You have bestowed on me and on my parents, to do such good deeds that will please You; and admit me, by Your mercy, among Your righteous servants","27:20":"He took a roll call of the birds and said: \"I do not see the hoopoe, where is he? How could he be absent","27:21":"I will certainly punish him severely or even slay him, if he does not offer me a reasonable excuse for his absence","27:22":"The hoopoe, who did not take long in coming, said: I have just found out that which you do not know. I have brought you reliable information about the people of Sheba","27:23":"I found that a woman is ruling over them, she has been given everything and she possesses a magnificent throne","27:24":"Further I found that she and her people prostrate themselves before the sun instead of Allah.

A very important letter has been delivered to me","27:30":"it is from Solomon, and it begins with the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful","27:31":"It reads: Do not be arrogant against me and come to me in complete submission (as a Muslim)","27:32":"Then she asked: \"O chiefs! Let me hear your advice, for I make no decision without your counsel","27:33":"They replied: \"We are a valiant and mighty nation. You are the commander. So we shall be waiting for your command","27:34":"The queen said: \"When the kings invade a town, they ruin it and debase its honorable people; and thus they always do","27:35":"Therefore, I shall send them a present and see with what reply my envoys will return","27:36":"When the envoys of the queen came to Solomon, he said: \"Do you want to provide me wealth? The wealth which Allah has given me is far more than what He has given you. You may very well keep your presents","27:37":"Go back to your people: if your people do not submit, we will march against them with such an army of which they shall never be able to face, and we shall drive them out of their land humbled and disgraced","27:38":"Later on when Solomon heard that the Queen of Sheba was coming in submission, he asked: \"O my chiefs! Which of you can bring to me her throne before they come to me in submission","27:39":"An audacious one from the Jinns said: \"I will bring it to you before you adjourn your court; and most surely I have the necessary strength and I am trustworthy","27:40":"One person who had knowledge of the Book said: \"I can bring it to you in the twinkling of an eye.\" As soon as Solomon saw the throne placed before him, he exclaimed: \"This is by the grace of my Lord to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. Any who is grateful, surely his gratitude is a gain for his own soul, and any who is ungrateful should know that surely my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Self- Exalted","27:41":"Further he said: \"Without any comment to her, set her throne in her sight; let us see whether she recognize it or she is of those who cannot recognize the Truth","27:42":"So when the queen arrived, she was asked: \"Is your throne like this?\" She replied: \"It looks as if it is the same; we had come to know that Solomon is not only a king but also a Prophet, therefore we have already become Muslims","27:43":"Other deities whom she worshiped besides Allah had prevented her from believing, for she belonged to an unbelieving folk","27:44":"Then she was asked to enter the palace. When she saw its floor, she thought that there was pool of water, so she tucked up her skirts uncovering her legs. Solomon said. \"This is just a glossy paving of this palace.\" At this she exclaimed: \"O my Lord","27:45":"To the people of Thamud, We sent their brother Saleh, saying: \"Worship Allah,\" but they divided themselves into two discordant factions","27:46":"Saleh said: \"O my people! Why do you wish to hasten towards evil rather than good? Why do you not ask forgiveness of Allah so that you may be shown mercy","27:47":"They said: \"We consider you and your companions a sign of bad luck.\" He said: \"Your luck is with Allah; in fact, you are a people under trial","27:48":"There were nine ringleaders in the city who created mischief in the land and reformed nothing","27:49":"They said to one another: \"Let us pledge on oath by Allah that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his family, then we shall tell his guardian that we were not even present at the time his family was killed, and that we are telling the truth","27:50":"Thus they plotted a plan, and We too plotted a plan which they did not perceive","27:51":"Just see what was the outcome of their plot! We annihilated them completely, together with all their people","27:52":"There lies their houses in desolate ruins as a result of their wrongdoings. Verily in this story there is a lesson for those people who use their common sense","27:53":"Yet We delivered the true believers who were righteous","27:54":"Also mention to them of Lot, when he said to his people: \"Do you commit indecency though you see its iniquity","27:55":"Do you approach men for your sexual desires instead of women? The fact is that you are a people steeped in ignorance","27:56":"But his people gave no answer except that they said: \"Drive out the family of Lot from your city: they pose to be very pious","27:57":"So, We delivered him and his family except his wife - about whom We had decreed that she shall be of those who will remain behind","27:58":"and We rained down on them a shower of brimstones, and evil was the rain which fell on those who were forewarned","27:59":"Say: \"Praise be to Allah and peace be on His servants whom He has chosen to deliver His message. Ask them: \" Who is better? Allah or the deities they associate with Him","27:60":"Is not He (Allah), Who has created the heavens and the earth, sends down rain from the sky and with it brings forth the beautiful gardens not better than the false gods that they worship? It is not in your ability to cause the growth of trees for those gardens. Is there another god besides Allah who could do that? No doubt they are a people who have swerved from justice in ascribing equals to Him","27:61":"Just think who has made the earth a place for your residence, caused in it the rivers to flow, set mountains upon it and placed a barrier between the two seas? Is there another god besides Allah? Nay, most of them have no knowledge","27:62":"Just think who answers the oppressed person when he cries out to Him and relieves his affliction, and makes you, O mankind, inheritors of the earth? Is there another god besides Allah? How little do you reflect","27:63":"Just think who guides you in darkness on the land and the sea, and who sends the winds as heralds of good news of His mercy? Is there another god besides Allah? Exalted be Allah above what they associate with Him","27:64":"Just think who originates creation and then repeats its production, and who gives you sustenance from the heavens and the earth? Is there another god besides Allah? Say: \"Show us your proof if you are telling the truth","27:65":"Say: No one in the heavens or in the earth has the knowledge of the unseen except Allah and their gods do not know when they shall be raised to life again","27:66":"Their knowledge does not grasp the Hereafter; rather they are in doubt about it; nay, they are blind concerning it","27:67":"The unbelievers say: \"What! When we and our fathers have become dust, shall we really be raised from the dead","27:68":"This promise which is made to us was also made to our forefathers before us; these are nothing but the legends of primitive people","27:69":"Say: \"Travel through the earth and see what has been the end of the criminals","27:70":"O Prophet, do not worry about them nor feel distressed because of their plots","27:71":"They also say: \"When will this promise be fulfilled if what you say be true","27:72":"Say: \"It may be that a part of what you wish to hasten is near at hand","27:73":"The fact is that your Lord is very gracious to mankind: yet most of them are ungrateful","27:74":"Indeed your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they reveal","27:75":"Nor there is any secret in the heaven and the earth which is not recorded in a clear Book","27:76":"In fact, this Qur’an clarifies for the Children of Israel most of those matters in which they differ","27:77":"It is certainly a guide and blessing to true believers","27:78":"Surely your Lord will decide between them by His judgement, He is the All-Mighty, the All-Knowing","27:79":"Therefore, put your trust in Allah, for you are certainly on the manifest Truth","27:80":"The fact is that you cannot make the dead hear you, nor can you make the deaf hear the call especially when they turn their backs and pay no heed","27:81":"nor can you guide the blind people to prevent them from straying; none will listen to you except those who believe in Our revelations and become Muslims","27:82":"When the time to fulfill Our word comes to pass, We will bring out from the earth a monster that shall speak to them, because the people did not believe in Our revelations","27:83":"On that Day We shall gather from every nation a multitude of those who disbelieved Our revelations; then they shall be arranged in classifications according to their merits","27:84":"until when they have all arrived, their Lord will ask: \"Did you deny My revelations without gaining their comprehensive knowledge? If not this, what else were you doing","27:85":"The sentence will be carried out against them for the consequence of their wrongdoings and they will not be able to utter a word","27:86":"Do they not see that We have made the night for them to rest in, and the day to give them light? Surely there are signs in this for the true believers","27:87":"On the Day, when the trumpet shall be blown and all who dwell in the heavens and the earth shall be terrified except those whom Allah will choose to spare, and all shall come to Him in utter humiliation","27:88":"these mountains which you see and think are firmly fixed, will pass away like clouds.

Should you not be rewarded according to your deeds","27:91":"O Muhammad, say to them: \"I have been commanded to worship the Lord of this city (Mecca), the One Who has made it sacred and Who is the Owner of all things; and I am commanded to be of those who are Muslims","27:92":"and that I should recite The Qur’an. Now, whoever follows this guidance will be guided for his own good, and to him who goes astray, say: \"I am merely a Warner","27:93":"Then proclaim: \"Praise be to Allah, very soon He will show you His signs and you will recognize them. Your Lord is not unaware of what you do","28:1":"Tua Sin M'im","28:2":"These are the verses of the Glorious Book that makes the things clear","28:3":"In all truth, We narrate to you some information about Moses and Pharoah (Pharaoh) for the instruction of the believers","28:4":"The fact is that Pharoah elevated himself in the land and divided its residents into groups, one group of which he persecuted, putting their sons to death and sparing only their females. Indeed he was one of the mischief-makers","28:5":"But We wanted to favor those who were oppressed in the land, and make them leaders, and make them the heirs","28:6":"establish them in the land, and show Pharoah, Haman and their warriors at their hands the same which they feared","28:7":"So We revealed Our will to the mother of Moses: \"Suckle him, and when you feel any danger to his life, cast him into the river without any fear or grief; for We shall certainly restore him to you and make him one of Our Messengers","28:8":"We made Pharoah’s family pick him up from the river: it was intended that Moses may become their adversary and a cause of their sorrow; for Pharoah, Haman and their warriors were all sinners","28:9":"The wife of Pharoah said: \"This child may become the comfort of the eyes for me and for you. Do not kill him. He may prove useful to us or it may be that we will adopt him as our son.\" They were unaware of the result of what they were doing","28:10":"On the other hand, the heart of Moses’s mother was sorely troubled. She would have disclosed as to who he was, had We not strengthened her heart so that she might become one of the true believers","28:11":"She said to Moses’s sister: \"Go, and follow him.\" So she (Moses's sister) watched him from a distance in such a way that the others did not notice it","28:12":"We had already ordained that he would refuse to suck any foster mother. His sister came to Pharoah's wife and said: \"Shall I point out to you a house whose people will take care of him for you and they will be sincere to him","28:13":"Thus did We restore him to his mother that her eye might be comforted, that she might not grieve and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true. Yet most of the people do not understand","28:14":"When he reached maturity and became full-grown, We bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge. Thus do We reward the righteous","28:15":"One day he entered the city at a time when its people were not yet active, he found two men reaching to each others throats; one was from his own race and the other of his foes. The man of his own race appealed for his help against his foe, whereupon Moses gave his foe a blow which killed him. On seeing what he has done he said: \"This is the work of Satan, surely he is an enemy that openly misleads","28:16":"Then he prayed: \"O my Lord! I have indeed wronged my soul, please forgive me.\" So Allah forgave him, surely He is the Forgiving, the Merciful","28:17":"Moses promised: \"O my Lord! After this favor that You have bestowed on me, I shall never be a helping hand to the criminals","28:18":"Next morning as he was walking in the city in fear and caution, suddenly he saw the same man whom he had helped the day before cried out to him again for help. Moses replied: \"You are certainly a misguided person","28:19":"Then when Moses was about to lay his hands on a man who was an enemy to both of them, he cried out: \"O Moses! Do you intend to kill me as you killed a person yesterday? You only want to become a tyrant in the land and have no intention of reforming anything","28:20":"At that time, there came a man running from the other end of the city and said: \"O Moses! The chiefs are plotting to kill you, therefore, run away, surely I am your well wisher","28:21":"Hearing this, Moses left that place in fear and caution, praying: \"O my Lord! Deliver me from the nation of wrongdoers","28:22":"As he made his way towards Madyan, he said: \"Soon my Lord shall guide me to the Right Way","28:23":"When he arrived at the well of Madyan, he saw a multitude of men watering their flocks, and besides them two women who were keeping their flocks back. He asked: \"What is the problem?\" They replied: \"We cannot water our flocks until the shepherds take away their flocks from the water, because we are weak and our father is a very old man","28:24":"So he watered their flocks for them and went back to the shade and prayed: \"O Lord! Surely I am in desperate need of whatever good that You may send down to me","28:25":"Soon after that, one of the two women came to him walking bashfully and said: \"My father is calling you. He wishes to reward you for watering our flocks for us.\" When Moses came to him and narrated his story, the old man said: \"Have no fear. You have escaped from those wicked people","28:26":"One of the daughters said: \"Father, hire this man. The best that one can hire is a man who is strong and trustworthy","28:27":"The old man said to Moses: \"I am willing to give you one of my daughters in marriage if you stay in my service for eight years; but you may complete ten if you wish. I do not want to put you in trouble; Allah willing, you will find me one of the righteous","28:28":"Moses replied: \"So be it an agreement between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I complete, let there be no compulsion on me. Allah is the witness to what we have agreed upon","28:29":"After completing the term of his agreement, when Moses was travelling with his family, he saw a fire in the direction of Mount Tur. He said to his family: \"Stay here, I saw a fire and I hope to bring some information from there or a lighted torch with which you may warm yourselves","28:30":"But when he reached there, a voice called out to him from the right side of the valley of the blessed spot from a tree , saying: \"O Moses, surely I am Allah the Lord of the Worlds","28:31":"Then Allah commanded, \"Throw down your staff.\" When Moses saw that the staff was writhing like a snake, he turned his back and fled, and did not even look behind. Allah said, \"O Moses, come back and do not fear; you are quite safe","28:32":"Now put your hand into your pocket: it will come out shining white without any harm to you -whenever you feel afraid, draw your hand towards yourself to ward off fear - these are two credentials from your Lord towards Pharoah and his chiefs, surely they are wicked people","28:33":"Moses submitted: \"Lord! I have killed one of them: I fear that they will put me to death","28:34":"My brother Haroon (Aaron), he is more eloquent in speech than I: send him with me as a helper to confirm my words; I fear that they will treat me as a liar","28:35":"Allah replied: \"We will certainly strengthen your arm with your brother and give both of you such authority that they shall not be able to harm you. Now proceed with Our signs. You, and those who follow you, will surely triumph","28:36":"When Moses came to them (Pharoah and his chiefs) with Our clear signs and invited them to Islam, they said: \"This is nothing but baseless sorcery; we never heard such a thing in the time of our forefathers","28:37":"Moses stated: \"My Lord knows best who it is that comes with guidance from Him and who will gain the reward of the hereafter; surely the wrongdoers will not attain felicity","28:38":"Pharoah said: \"O Chiefs! You have no other god that I know of, except myself. O Haman!

Whenever they are in danger, they look towards you with their eyes rolling as though they were at the point of death, but when they are out of danger, they will come to greet you with their sharp tongues in greed for gain.

Allah takes cognizance of all things","33:53":"O believers! Do not enter the houses of the Prophet without permission, nor stay waiting for meal time: but if you are invited to a meal, enter, and when you have eaten disperse and do not seek long conversation. Such behavior annoys the Prophet, he feels shy in asking you to leave, but Allah does not feel shy in telling the truth. If you have to ask his wives for anything, speak to them from behind a curtain. This is more chaste for your hearts and for theirs. It is not proper for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever to marry his wives after him; this would be a grievous offence in the sight of Allah","33:54":"Whether you reveal anything or conceal it, surely Allah has full knowledge of all things","33:55":"There is no blame on the ladies if they appear before their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons, their familiar women and those whom their right hands possess (slaves).

If We want, We can cave in the earth to swallow them up or let the fragments of the sky fall upon them. Surely there is a sign in this for every devotee that turns to Allah in repentance","34:10":"We bestowed Our blessings on David and commanded: \"O mountains! Join him in singing My rhymes,\" and a similar command was given to the birds. We made iron soft for him","34:11":"saying: \"make coats of armor measuring out the links in mail and O people of David, do good deeds; surely I am watching over all of your actions","34:12":"And We made the winds subservient to Solomon, which made a month’s journey in the morning and a month’s journey in the evening; and We made a fountain of molten copper to flow for him; and subdued Jinns for him who worked in front of him by the leave of his Lord; and if any of them turned aside from Our command, We made Him taste the punishment of the blazing fire","34:13":"They worked for him as he desired: making arches, images, basins as large as reservoirs and built-in cooking cauldrons. We said: \"O Family of David! Work gratefully.\" Only a few of My devotees are truly grateful","34:14":"When We decreed Solomon’s death he was leaning on his staff. The Jinns did not know that he was dead until the termite ate away his staff and he fell down.

It all happened because We wanted to see who among them believed in the hereafter and who is in doubt concerning it. Your Lord is watching over all things","34:22":"O Prophet, say to the pagans: \"Call on those deities whom you pray besides Allah they do not have power over an atom’s weight of anything in the heavens or earth, nor have they any share in either, nor is any of them a helper to Allah","34:23":"No intercession before Allah can avail anyone except for the one for whom He permits.

Our tie is with You - as a protector - not with them; but they used to worship the Jinns and it was them in whom most of these people believed","34:42":"On that Day you will be helpless to profit or harm one another. To the wrongdoers We shall say: \"Taste the punishment of the fire which you persistently denied","34:43":"Today when Our clear revelations are recited to them, they say: \"This man only wants to turn you away from those gods to whom your forefathers have been worshipping.\" Others say: \"This Qur’an is nothing but an invented falsehood.\" While yet others, who deny the truth when it comes to them, say: \"This is nothing but plain magic","34:44":"In fact, neither had We given them books to study, nor had We sent to them any Warner before you","34:45":"Those who have gone before them also denied - these Arabs have not received one tenth of what We had granted them - yet when they denied My Messengers, see how terrible was My scourge","34:46":"O Prophet say: \"I would ask you one thing. For Allah’s sake! Think individually or consult one another and ponder whether your companion Muhammad is really mad? You yourself will come to the conclusion that he is nothing but a Warner to you to forewarn you of a severe punishment","34:47":"Tell them: \"I do not ask you for any recompense, even though what I preach is all in your interest. My reward is only due from Allah and He is a witness over everything","34:48":"Say: \"In fact my Lord reveals to me the truth, and He is the Knower of all hidden realities","34:49":"Say: \"The truth has arrived and falsehood neither originates nor restores anything","34:50":"Say: \"If I am in error, the loss is surely mine and if I am right, it is because of what my Lord has revealed to me. Surely He hears all and is very close","34:51":"If you could only see the disbelievers on the Day of Judgement when they will be in a state of confusion! On that Day there will be no escape; and they will be seized from a nearby place","34:52":"Then they will say: \"We believe in it (the Truth brought by the Prophet\": but how could they attain the Faith from such a far distant place)","34:53":"They had disbelieved in it before - and they had sneered at the unseen when they were far away during their life on earth","34:54":"A barrier will be placed between them and what they desired to have as was done with the similar people before them; for they were indeed involved in a misleading suspicion","35:1":"Praise be to Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth! Who appoint the angels having two, three and four pairs of wings as His messengers. He adds to His creation as He pleases; for Allah has power over all things","35:2":"None can withhold the blessings which He bestows on people and none can award besides Him what He withholds. He is the Mighty, the Wise","35:3":"O mankind! Call to mind the favors of Allah on you; is there any other creator than Allah who provides for you from the heavens and the earth? There is no god but Him. How then are you being deceived","35:4":"O Prophet! If they deny you, so were the Messengers denied before you. All affairs shall ultimately be presented before Allah","35:5":"O mankind! Certainly the promise of Allah is true, therefore let not the life of this world deceive you nor let the chief deceiver (Satan) deceive you about Allah","35:6":"Surely Satan (Satan) is your enemy: so take him as an enemy. He is inviting his adherents towards his way so that they may become companions of the blazing fire","35:7":"Those who disbelieve shall have a terrible punishment, and those who believe and do good deeds shall have forgiveness and a magnificent reward","35:8":"Can that person be guided whose evil deeds are so fair seeming to him that he considers them good? The fact is that Allah leaves to stray whom He wills and guides whom He pleases. Therefore, O Prophet, let not your soul expire in sorrow on their account. Allah is aware of all their actions","35:9":"It is Allah Who sends forth winds to raise up the clouds, then drives them to a dead land and therewith revive the earth after its death. Similar will be the resurrection of the dead","35:10":"If anyone is seeking honor, let him know that all honor belongs to Allah Alone. Good words ascend to Him and good deeds are exalted by Him. As for those who plan evil deeds, they shall have severe punishment and their plots will be brought to nothing","35:11":"It is Allah Who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then He made you pairs. No female conceives or delivers without His knowledge. No long- lived man grows old or has his life cut short but is written in a Book; surely all this is easy for Allah","35:12":"The two bodies of water, of which one is sweet and pleasant to drink and the other is salty and bitter, are not alike. Yet from each kind of water you eat fresh meat and extract ornaments which you wear; and you see the ships plough their course through them to seek the bounty of Allah, that you may be grateful","35:13":"He causes the night to pass into the day and the day into the night, and He has made the sun and the moon to serve you; each one follows its course for an appointed term. Such is Allah, your Lord; His is the kingdom; and those to whom you pray besides Him do not even own a thread of a date-stone","35:14":"If you pray to them they cannot hear your prayers and even if they could hear you they could not answer you. On the Day of Resurrection they will deny your associating them with Allah. O mankind! None can inform you about all this except the One Who is All-Aware","35:15":"O mankind! It is you who stands in need of Allah, and it is Allah Who is Free of all wants, Worthy of all praise","35:16":"If He wants, He can destroy you and replace you with a new creation","35:17":"and this is not at all difficult for Allah","35:18":"No bearer of a burden will bear another’s burden, and if a heavy laden person cries out for help, none will come forward to share the least of his burden, even though he be a close relative. O Prophet! You can only admonish those who fear their Lord - though they cannot see Him - and establish Salah. He that purifies himself does so for his own good. To Allah is the destination of all","35:19":"The blind and the seeing are not alike","35:20":"nor the darkness and the Light","35:21":"nor the shade and the heat","35:22":"nor the living and the dead. Certainly Allah can make anyone hear if He so wills; but, O Prophet, you cannot make those who are in the graves hear you","35:23":"You are nothing but a Warner","35:24":"Certainly We have sent you (O Muhammad) with the Truth as a bearer of good news and as a Warner, for there has not been a nation which has not had a Warner","35:25":"If they disbelieve you, know that their predecessors also disbelieved their Messengers who came to them with clear signs, scriptures and the light-giving Book","35:26":"But in the end I seized the disbelievers, and behold, how terrible was My disapproval","35:27":"Do you not see that Allah sends down rain from the sky with which We bring forth fruits of various colors? Similarly, in the mountains there are streaks of various shades including white, red, jet-black rocks","35:28":"Likewise men, beasts and cattle have their different colors. In fact, only those among His servants who possess knowledge fear Allah; surely Allah is All-Mighty, All-Forgiving","35:29":"Surely those who recite the Book of Allah, establish Salah, spend out of what We have given them, secretly and openly, may hope for imperishable gain","35:30":"That He may pay them back their full reward and give them even more out of His grace; surely He is Forgiving and Appreciative of His devotees","35:31":"O Prophet, what We have revealed to you of the Book is the Truth, which confirms the previous scriptures. Surely, with respect to His servants, Allah is well Aware and fully Observant","35:32":"We have given the Book as an inheritance to those of Our servants (Muslims) whom We have chosen, among them there are some who wrong their own souls, some follow a middle course and some, by Allah’s leave, excel in good deeds; which is the supreme virtue","35:33":"They shall enter the gardens of Eden, where they shall be decked with bracelets of gold and pearls; and their dress therein will be of silk","35:34":"They will say: \"Praise be to Allah Who has removed all sorrow from us; Our Lord is indeed Forgiving and appreciative of His devotees","35:35":"Who has admitted us to this Eternal Home out of His bounty, wherein we neither experience any toil nor sense of any weariness","35:36":"As for the disbelievers, there shall be the fire of hell, no term shall be determined for them so that they could die nor shall its punishment be ever lightened for them. Thus shall We reward every disbeliever","35:37":"Therein they shall cry for help: \"Our Lord! Get us out, from now on we shall do good deeds and shall not repeat the ones we used to do\". The response will be: \"Did we not give you lives long enough so that he who would, could take a warning? Besides, someone did come to warn you. Now taste the fruit of your deeds, here there is no helper for the wrongdoers","35:38":"Surely Allah knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth, He even knows the secrets of the breasts (hidden thoughts of people)","35:39":"It is He Who has made you vicegerent on the earth. Whoever disbelieves, bears the burden of his disbelief; and for the disbelievers their disbelief does not increase anything except the wrath of their Lord and the disbelievers do not gain anything except an increase in their loss","35:40":"O Prophet, say: \"Have you ever considered your associate gods to whom you call upon besides Allah? Show me anything that they have created in the earth! Or what is their share in the creation of the heavens? Or have We given them a Book from which they derive a provision of shirk? Nay, in fact the wrongdoers promise each other nothing but delusions","35:41":"It is Allah Who keeps the heavens and the earth from slipping out of their places. Should they ever slip, none can hold them back besides Him; certainly He is Most Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving","35:42":"These very people used to swear on solemn oaths by Allah that if a Warner ever comes to them, they would be better guided than any other nation of the world; yet when a Warner has come to them they have increased in nothing but aversion","35:43":"behaving arrogantly in the land and plotting evil, whereas the plotting of evil recoils none but the authors of it. Are they awaiting for that end which overtook the former nations? If so, you shall find no change in the ways of Allah, nor will you find any alteration in Allah’s way of dealing","35:44":"Have they not traveled through the land and saw what was the end of those who went before them, who were far superior in strength than these people? There is nothing in the heavens or in the earth which can frustrate Allah; surely He is All-Knowing, All-Powerful","35:45":"If it was Allah’s will to punish people for their misdeeds, He would have not left any living creature around them on the surface of the earth, but He is giving them respite for an appointed time; when their appointed time will come, they shall realize that in fact Allah has been watching His servants all along","36:1":"Ya Sin","36:2":"I swear by the Qur’an which is full of Wisdom","36:3":"that you are indeed one of the Messengers who are sent","36:4":"on a Straight Way","36:5":"This Qur’an is revealed by the Almighty, the Merciful","36:6":"So that you may warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, hence they are unaware","36:7":"In fact, the Word has been proven true against most of them who are arrogant; so they do not believe","36:8":"Since they have chosen to neglect Our revelations, We have thus put yokes round their necks right up to their chins so their heads are raised up","36:9":"and We have put a barrier in front of them and a barrier behind them, and then We have covered them over so they cannot see","36:10":"It is the same for them whether you warn them or warn them not, they will not believe","36:11":"You can only warn those who follow the reminder and fears the Compassionate (Allah), though they cannot see Him.

We have recorded everything in an open ledger","36:13":"Narrate to them the example of the people of a certain town to whom the Messengers came","36:14":"At first We sent to them two Messengers, but when they rejected both, We strengthened them with a third and they all said: \"Surely we have been sent to you as Messengers","36:15":"But the people replied: \"You are but humans like us. The Compassionate (Allah) has revealed nothing; you are surely lying","36:16":"They said: \"Our Lord knows that we have indeed been sent as Messengers towards you","36:17":"and our only duty is to convey His message plainly","36:18":"The people replied: \"We regard you as an evil omen for us.

While those who are unbelievers, they are to enjoy only this life and eat as cattle eat; but in the hereafter, the fire shall be their abode","47:13":"How many cities which were mightier than your city which has driven you out, have We destroyed for their disbelief, and there was none to save them","47:14":"Can he who follows the clear guidance from his Lord be compared to him who is led by his own desires and whose foul deeds seem fair to him","47:15":"Here is the parable of the paradise which the righteous have been promised: it has rivers the water of which will never be stagnant, rivers of milk whose taste never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of honey pure and clear. In it they will have all kinds of fruits, as well as forgiveness from their Lord. Can such people be compared to those who shall dwell in hell forever, and they will be given scalding water which will cut their intestines into pieces","47:16":"Some of them indeed listen to you but no sooner do they leave your presence than they ask those endowed with knowledge: \"What was it that he said just now?\" Such are the men upon whose hearts Allah has set a seal, and who follow their own desires","47:17":"As for those who follow the Right Way, Allah will increase their guidance and bestow on them their righteousness","47:18":"Are they waiting for the Hour of Doom to overtake them all of a sudden? Do they not know that its signs have already come and when it will actually overtake them, what chance will they have to benefit by this admonition","47:19":"Therefore, you should know that there is no god but Allah; implore Him to forgive your sins and to forgive the believing men and believing women; for Allah knows your activities and your resting places","47:20":"The believers were asking: \"Why is not a Surah revealed allowing us to fight?\" But when a decisive Surah carrying the order of allowing them to fight is revealed, you saw those in whose hearts was a disease looking at you like the one under the shadow of death. Woe to them","47:21":"On their tongues is the promise of obedience and good talk, so if they would have proved their promise with Allah when the final command was given, it would have been better for them","47:22":"Now what can be expected of you if you are put in authority, other than to do evil in the land and violate the ties of blood","47:23":"Such are those whom Allah has cursed and made them deaf and blinded their sight","47:24":"Will they not ponder upon the Qur’an? Are there locks upon their hearts","47:25":"Those who turn back to unbelief after the guidance has become clear are seduced by Satan who gives them false hopes","47:26":"That is why they said to those who showed an aversion to what Allah has revealed: \"We shall obey you in some matters,\" and Allah knows their secret talks","47:27":"Then what will they do when the angels carry off their souls, smiting their faces and their backs","47:28":"That will happen because they followed the way that called for the wrath of Allah and hated to adopt the way of His pleasure, therefore He made all their deeds void","47:29":"Do those in whose hearts is a disease think that Allah will not reveal their malice","47:30":"Had We so pleased, We could have pointed them out to you and you would have recognized them promptly by their faces. But you will surely know them by the tone of their speech. Allah knows all of your actions","47:31":"We shall put you to test until We know the valiant and the resolute among you, and test all that is said about you","47:32":"The unbelievers who obstruct others from the Way of Allah and disputed the Messenger after the guidance has become clear to them shall in no way harm Allah; as a result, he will bring their deeds to nothing","47:33":"O believers!

To Allah belong the forces of the heavens and the earth. Allah is All-Knowledgeable, All-Wise","48:5":"He has caused you to do as you have done, so that He may admit the believing men and believing women into the gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever and remove their ills from them; and that is the highest achievement for men in the sight of Allah","48:6":"And that He may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the pagan men and the pagan women, who entertained an evil thought about Allah. A turn of evil shall befall them, for Allah's wrath is upon them.

The Hand of Allah was above their hands. Now, the one who will break his pledge, will break it at his own peril, and the one who will keep his pledge that he has made with Allah, shall soon be given a great reward by Him","48:11":"The beduin Arabs who stayed behind will soon say to you: \"Our goods and families kept us occupied, so please ask forgiveness for us.\" They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Tell them: \"Who can intervene on your behalf with Allah if it be His will to do you harm or He pleases to do you good? Allah is well aware of your actions","48:12":"Rather you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families; this fancy seemed pleasing to your hearts. You conceived evil thoughts and thus incurred damnation","48:13":"He who does not believe in Allah and His Messenger, We have prepared a blazing fire for such unbelievers","48:14":"To Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth: He forgives whom He pleases and He punishes whom He wills.

He has restrained the hands of enemies from you, so that it may serve as a sign to the believers and that He may guide you to the Right Way","48:21":"Besides, He promises you other spoils as well, which are not yet within your reach but Allah has surely encompassed them. Allah has power over everything","48:22":"Even if the unbelievers had fought with you, they would have been put to flight, and would have not found any protector or helper","48:23":"Such has been the practice of Allah in the past; and you shall find no change in the practice of Allah","48:24":"It is He Who has restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca, after that He had given you victory over them, and Allah was watching all your actions","48:25":"They are the ones who disbelieved and obstructed you from the Masjid-al-Haram (Sacred Mosque - Ka'bah) and prevented your offerings from reaching their destination. Had there not been believing men and believing women in the city of Mecca, whom you did not know, and their possibility of being trampled under your feet and thus incurring unwitting guilt on their account, Allah would have allowed you to fight, but He held back your hands, so that He may admit to His mercy whom He will.

So, He granted you a near victory before the fulfillment of that vision","48:28":"It is He who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the religion of truth, so that He may exalt this religion over all other religions: and sufficient is Allah as a witness","48:29":"Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, and those with him are strong against the unbelievers and compassionate to each other among themselves. When you see them, you will find them making Rakuh (bowing down) and Sajud (prostrate in prayers), and craving for the blessings from Allah and His good pleasure. They have the marks of Sajud (prostration) on their foreheads, the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Torah; and their similitude in the Gospel: they are like the seed which puts forth its sprout, then strengthens it, then becomes thick and stands firmly on its stem, delighting the sowers of the seed, so that through them He may enrage the unbelievers. Yet to those of them who will believe and do good deeds, Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward","49:1":"O believers! Do not put yourselves ahead of Allah and His Messenger.

If he were to follow you in most affairs, you would certainly be in trouble.

It is they who are rightly guided","49:8":"through Allah’s grace and blessing. Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise","49:9":"If two parties among the believers fall into mutual fighting, make peace between them. Then if one of them transgresses against the other, fight the one who has transgressed until he returns to the commands of Allah.

Let no men laugh at other men who may perhaps be better than themselves; and let no woman laugh at another woman, who may perhaps be better than herself. Do not defame through sarcastic remarks about one another, nor call one another by offensive nicknames. It is an evil thing to be called by a bad name after being a believer, and those who do not repent are the ones who are the wrongdoers","49:12":"O believers! Avoid immoderate suspicion, for in some cases suspicion is a sin. Do not spy on one another, nor backbite one another (to say something about another behind ones back that if one hears it, dislikes it). Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Surely you would abhor it. Fear Allah; for Allah is the Accepter of repentance, Merciful","49:13":"O mankind!

Such are the ones who are truthful in their claim to be the believers","49:16":"O Prophet say to those who claim to have believed: \"Do you apprise Allah of your religion? Whereas, Allah knows all that is in the heavens and the earth and He has full knowledge of everything","49:17":"They think they have conferred upon you a favor by embracing Islam. Tell them: \"You have conferred upon me no favor by accepting Islam.

Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful","57:29":"You should adopt this way so that the people of the Book may know that they do not have the sole right to the grace of Allah, and that His grace is entirely in His own hands, which He bestows on whomever He wills: and Allah is the Owner of mighty grace","58:1":"Allah has indeed heard the words of the woman (Khawlah daughter of Tha‘labah, who had been divorced by calling her: ‘‘You are to me like my mother\" which was an acceptable practice for divorce among pagan Arabs), who pleaded with you against her husband and made her complaint to Allah, and Allah has heard what you said to each other. Allah hears all and sees all","58:2":"Those of you who divorce their wives by ZihAr (calling them to be like their mothers) should know that they are not their mothers. Their mothers are only those who gave birth to them. Surely the words they utter are absurd and false. Allah could punish them for this but He forgave them, surely Allah is All-Pardoning, All-Forgiving","58:3":"Those who divorce their wives by ZihAr, then wish to retract the words they uttered, shall have to free a slave before they touch each other. This is enjoined as a penalty for doing so. Allah is well-aware of all your actions","58:4":"He that has no slave, shall fast two consecutive months before they touch each other. He that cannot fast, shall feed sixty poor people. This is enjoined so that you may have faith in Allah and His Messenger.

We have sent down clear revelations; the disbelievers shall have a humiliating punishment","58:6":"On the Day of Judgment Allah will raise them all back to life, then inform them about what they have done. Allah has kept full record of their deeds even though they may have forgotten, for Allah is a witness over all things","58:7":"Are you not aware that Allah knows all that is in the heavens and in the earth? It cannot be that three persons converse in secret and He is not the fourth of them; or five persons converse in secret and He is not the sixth of them; whether fewer or more, wherever they may be, He is with them. Then on the Day of Resurrection He will inform them of what they have done, surely Allah has knowledge of all things","58:8":"Have you not seen those who, though forbidden to hold secret counsels, persistently do what was forbidden? They hold secret counsels among themselves for sin, hostility and disobedience to the Messenger. Yet when they come to you, they greet you in words which Allah does not greet you with, and say to themselves: \"Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?\" Hell is enough for them, they shall burn in its flames, what an evil destination","58:9":"O believers! When you confer together in private, do not talk about sin and hostility and disobedience to the Messenger; but to counsel about virtue and piety, and fear Allah, before whom you shall be brought together","58:10":"Conspiring in secret is the work of Satan, who means to vex the believers; but he cannot harm them at all except as Allah permits; so in Allah let the believers put their trust","58:11":"O believers! When you are asked to make room in your meetings, make room, Allah will make room for you in the Hereafter. And if you are told to rise up, then rise up: Allah will raise to higher ranks those of you who have faith and knowledge. Allah is aware of all your actions","58:12":"O believers! When you want to consult the Messenger in private, offer something in charity before your consultation, that is best and purest for you. But if you lack the means, know that Allah is Oft- Forgiving, Most Merciful","58:13":"Do you hesitate to give out in charity before your private consultation with him? If you cannot afford it - Allah will forgive you - so establish Salah and pay Zakah, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah is well aware of all your actions","58:14":"Have you not seen the ones who have befriended those people who are under the wrath of Allah? They are neither on your side nor yet on theirs and they knowingly swear to falsehood","58:15":"Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment; evil indeed is what they are doing","58:16":"They use their oaths as shields, and debar others from the Way of Allah. They shall have a humiliating punishment","58:17":"Neither their riches nor their sons shall avail them anything against Allah. They shall be the inmates of hell and live there forever","58:18":"On the Day when Allah will raise them all to life, they will swear to Him as they now swear to you, thinking that their oaths will help them. By no means! Surely they are the liars","58:19":"Satan has gained possession of them, and caused them to forget Allah’s warning. They are the party of Satan. Beware! Surely it is the party of Satan that shall be the loser","58:20":"Those who resist Allah and His Messenger will be among the most humiliated","58:21":"Allah has decreed: \"It is I and My Messengers who will most certainly prevail.\" Surely Allah is All- Powerful, All-Mighty","58:22":"You will never find any people who believe in Allah and the last Day on friendly terms with those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even though they be their fathers, their sons, their brothers or their relatives. It is they in whose hearts Allah has inscribed faith and has strengthened them with a spirit of His own. He will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever. Allah will be well pleased with them, and they will be well pleased with Him. They are the party of Allah. Beware! Surely it is the party of Allah that will be successful","59:1":"All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah, and He is the Almighty, the All- Wise","59:2":"It is He Who drove the disbelievers from among the People of the Book (reference is to the Jewish tribe of Banu Al-Nadir) out of their homes at the first banishment. You did not think that they would ever go out; and they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah, but the wrath of Allah came to them from where they never expected - which cast such terror into their hearts - that they destroyed their homes by their own hands as well as by the hands of the believers. So learn a lesson from this example! O people of insight","59:3":"Had Allah not decreed exile for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world, and in the hereafter there shall be the punishment of the fire for them","59:4":"because they set themselves up against Allah and His Messenger; and he that sets himself up against Allah should know that Allah is stern in retribution","59:5":"Whatever palm-trees you cut down or left them standing on their roots, was by the leave of Allah, so that He might humiliate the transgressors","59:6":"As for those spoils of theirs which Allah has bestowed on His Messenger, you spurred neither cavalry nor camelry to capture them: but Allah gives authority to His Messengers over whom He pleases, for Allah has power over all things","59:7":"Whatever spoils from the dwellers of the township Allah has bestowed on His Messenger, shall belong to Allah, His Messenger, Messenger's relatives, and to the orphans, the needy and the travellers in need; so that it may not become the property of the rich among you. Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it and from whatever he forbids you, refrain from it. Fear Allah; for Allah is stern in retribution","59:8":"A share of the spoils shall be given to the indigent immigrants who were driven out of their homes and their possessions, and are seeking Allah’s grace and His good pleasure and who want to help Allah and His Messenger: such are indeed the true believers","59:9":"A share of the spoils shall also be given to those who made their abode in Medina (the Ansar) and believed even before the arrivals of the immigrants and love those who migrated to them and entertain no desire in their hearts for things given to them, and prefer those immigrants over themselves, even though they themselves are poor. In fact those who are saved from the greediness of hearts, are the ones who will achieve true success","59:10":"And it is also for those who came after them and say: \"Our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who embraced the faith before us and do not leave any malice in our hearts towards the believers. Our Lord! Surely You are the Kind, the Merciful","59:11":"Have you not observed the hypocrites? They say to their fellow unbelievers among the people of the Book: \"If they drive you out, we will go with you. We will never obey anyone who seeks to harm you. If you are attacked we will certainly help you.\" Allah bears witness that they are lying","59:12":"If the People of the Book are driven out, they will never go with them, nor, if the people of the Book are attacked, will they help them, and even if they help them, they will turn their backs; leaving them with no help at all","59:13":"In their hearts there is greater dread of you than of Allah, because they are a people devoid of understanding","59:14":"They will never fight against you together except in fortified townships and from behind walls. Strong is their valor amongst themselves; you think of them united whereas their hearts are divided. This is because they are a people devoid of wisdom","59:15":"Their example is like those who have tasted, a short while before them, the evil consequences of their deeds. They shall have a painful punishment","59:16":"Their parable is like the Satan who says to man disbelieve, but when man becomes a disbeliever, he says: \"I have nothing to do with you; I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds","59:17":"The end of both will be that they will be tossed in hell and remain there forever. Thus shall be the reward of the wrongdoers","59:18":"O believers! Fear Allah and let every soul see what it is sending for the morrow (Hereafter). Fear Allah, surely Allah is aware of all your actions","59:19":"Be not like those who forgot Allah, as a result Allah caused them to forget themselves, it is they who are the transgressors","59:20":"The companions of hell and the companions of paradise are not equals, of course the companions of paradise are far superior","59:21":"If We had sent down this Qur’an on a mountain, you would have seen it humble itself and split asunder from the fear of Allah, We are citing this example for mankind, so that they may take heed","59:22":"Allah is He, besides Whom there is no god, the Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Compassionate, the Merciful","59:23":"Allah is He, besides Whom there is no god, the King, the Holy, the Giver of peace, the Granter of security, the Guardian, the Almighty, the Irresistible, the Supreme: Glory be to Allah!

All that is in the heavens and the earth declares His glory, and He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise","60:1":"O believers! Do not make friendship with those who are enemies of Mine and yours. Would you show them friendship, when they have denied the truth that has come to you and have driven the Messenger and yourselves out of your homes, simply because you believe in Allah, your Lord? If it was indeed to strive in My way, and to seek My good pleasure that you left your homes, how can you befriend in secret? I know all that you conceal, and all that you reveal. Any of you who does this, he indeed has gone astray from the Right Way","60:2":"If they overcome you, they would behave to you as enemies and stretch out their hands and their tongues towards you with evil, and they wish to see you become unbelievers","60:3":"On the Day of Resurrection, neither your relatives nor your children shall avail you. Allah will judge between you, and He is observing all your actions","60:4":"You have an excellent example in Abraham and his companions. They said to their people plainly: \"We are clear of you and your gods, whom you worship besides Allah. We renounce you. Enmity and hate shall reign between us forever until you believe in Allah, the One and Only God.\" But do not emulate what Abraham said to his father: \"I will pray for your forgiveness, although I have no power to get anything for you from Allah.\" Their collective prayer was: \"Our Lord! In You we have put our trust, to You we turn in repentance and to You is our final goal","60:5":"Our Lord! Do not expose us to the plots of the unbelievers. Forgive us, our Lord! You are the All-Mighty, the All- Wise","60:6":"Truly, in those there is an excellent example for everyone who puts their hopes in Allah and the Last Day. He that gives no heed should know that Allah is free of all wants, worthy of all praise","60:7":"It may well be that Allah will put love between you and those with whom you are now at odds because of the order which is given to you, for Allah is All-Powerful, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful","60:8":"Allah does not forbid you to be kind and equitable to those who had neither fought against your faith nor driven you out of your homes. In fact Allah loves the equitable","60:9":"Allah only forbids you to make friendship with those who fought you on account of your faith and drove you out of your homes and backed up others in your expulsion. Those who will take them for friends are indeed the wrongdoers","60:10":"O believers! When the believing women seek refuge with you, test them. Allah best knows their faith. If you find them true believers, do not send them back to the unbelievers. They are not lawful to the unbelievers, nor are the unbelievers lawful to them. Return to their unbelieving husbands what they have spent on them. There is no blame on you if you marry such women, provided you give them their dowers. Do not hold on to your marriages with unbelieving women. Demand what you have spent on them and let the unbelievers do the same. This is the order of Allah which He has decreed between you. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise","60:11":"If you do not get back the demanded amount that you have spent on your disbelieving wives from the unbelievers, and your turn comes, to pay the demanded amount of Muslim wives to the unbelievers, you can offset the amount and pay those whose wives have fled the equivalent of the amount they have spent on their disbelieving wives. Fear Allah, in Whom you believe","60:12":"O Prophet! When the believing women come to you to take the oath of allegiance , take their pledge: that they will not commit shirk with Allah, that they will not steal, that they will not commit adultery, that they will not kill their children, that they will not give any cause for scandal which they may invent between either their hands or legs (a woman accusing another woman of having an illicit relationship with a man and spreads such stories - or - a woman carrying an illegitimate child and makes her husband believe that it is his), and that they will not disobey you in any just matter, then accept their allegiance and pray to Allah for the forgiveness. Surely Allah is Oft- Forgiving, most Merciful","60:13":"O believers! Do not befriend those who have incurred the wrath of Allah. Indeed they despair of the Hereafter, just as the unbelievers despair of those buried in the graves","61:1":"All that is in the heavens and the earth glorifies Allah. He is the All-Mighty, the All- Wise","61:2":"O believers! Why do you say something which you don’t do","61:3":"It is very hateful in the sight of Allah that you say something which you don’t do","61:4":"Indeed Allah loves those who fight for His Cause in battle array as if they were a solid wall","61:5":"Remember what Moses said to his people: \"O my people! Why do you vex me while you know that I am the Messenger of Allah towards you?\" But in spite of this when they adopted perverseness, Allah let their hearts be perverted. Allah does not guide those who are transgressors","61:6":"And remember when Jesus the son of Mary said: \"O children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah towards you, confirming the Torah which came before me, and to give you good news of a Messenger that will come after me whose name shall be Ahmed (another name of Muhammad, meaning ‘The praised one’).\" But when he (Muhammad) came to them with clear signs, they said \"This is plain magic","61:7":"Who could be more wrong than the one who invents falsehoods against Allah while he is being called towards Islam?

Should I tell you of a bargain that will save you from a painful punishment","61:11":"It is to believe in Allah and His Messenger and strive your utmost in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your persons. That is best for you, if you but knew it","61:12":"He will forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow, and will lodge you in beautiful mansions in the gardens of Eden, which will be a supreme achievement","61:13":"And yet another blessing which you love: help from Allah and a speedy victory. So O Prophet, give this good news to the believers","61:14":"O believers! Be the helpers of Allah, just as Jesus the son of Mary said to his disciples: \"Who will be my helper in the cause of Allah?\" And the disciples responded: \"We will be your helpers in the cause of Allah.\" Then a group from the children of Israel believed in him (Jesus) and another group disbelieved. We aided the believers against their enemies, so they became victorious","62:1":"AL-JUMU’AH - FRIDAY In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the merciful All that is in the heavens and earth declares the glory of Allah, the King, the Holy, the Mighty, the Wise","62:2":"It is He Who has raised among the unlettered people a Messenger of their own, who recites to them His revelations, purifies them, and teaches them the Book and Wisdom, though prior to this they were in gross error","62:3":"he is also sent for others of them who have not yet joined them (become Muslims).
