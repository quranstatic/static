And We shaded them with clouds and We sent down to them manna and quail: \"Eat from the good things that We have provided for you.\" They did not wrong Us, but it was their souls that they wronged","7:161":"And they were told: \"Reside in this town and eat from it as you please, and Say: \"Our load is removed,\" and enter the gate while prostrating, We will forgive for you your wrong doings, and We will increase for the good doers","7:162":"Those who were wicked amongst them altered what was said to them with something different; so We sent to them an affliction from the sky because they were wicked","7:163":"And ask them about the town which was by the sea, after they had transgressed the Sabbath; their fish would come to them openly on the day of their Sabbath, and when they are not in Sabbath, they do not come to them! It is such that We afflicted them for what they corrupted","7:164":"And a nation from amongst them said: \"Why do you preach to a people whom God will destroy or punish a painful retribution\" They said: \"A plea to your Lord, and perhaps they may be aware","7:165":"So when they forgot that which they were reminded of, We saved those who prohibited evil, and We took those who transgressed with a grievous retribution for what they were corrupting","7:166":"When they persisted in that which they had been prohibited from, We said to them: \"Be despicable apes","7:167":"And your Lord has sworn that He will send upon them, until the Day of Resurrection, people who would inflict severe punishment on them. Your Lord is quick to punish, and He is Forgiving, Merciful","7:168":"And We divided them through the land as nations. From them are the upright, and from them are other than that. And We tested them with good things and bad, perhaps they will return","7:169":"A generation came after them who inherited the Scripture, but they took the materialism of this world, which is lower; and they Say: \"It will be forgiven for us.\" And if materialism again comes to them they take it; was not the covenant of the Scripture taken on them that they would only say the truth about God And they studied what was in it; but the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are aware. Do you not comprehend","7:170":"As for those who adhere to the Scripture, and they hold the contact-method; We will not waste the reward of the righteous","7:171":"And We raised the mountain above them as if it were a cloud, and they thought it would fall on them: \"Take what We have given you with strength and remember what is in it that you may be righteous","7:172":"And your Lord took for the children of Adam from their backs, their progeny; and He made them witness over themselves: \"Am I not your Lord\" They said: \"Yes, we bear witness.\" Thus you cannot say on the Day of Resurrection that you were unaware of this","7:173":"Nor can you Say: \"It was our fathers who set up partners before and we were simply a progeny who came after them. Would You destroy us for what the innovators did","7:174":"It is such that We explain the revelations, perhaps they will revert","7:175":"And recite to them the story of the person whom Our revelations were given to him, but he removed himself from them, and thus the devil followed him, and He became of those who went astray","7:176":"Had We wished, We could have elevated him by it, but he stuck to the Earth and he followed his desire. His example is like the dog, if you scold him he pants, and if you leave him he pants; such is the example of the people who deny Our revelations. Relate the stories, perhaps they will think","7:177":"Miserable is the example of the people who denied Our revelations, and it was their souls that they had wronged","7:178":"Whoever God guides, then he is the guided one; and whoever He misguides, then these are the losers","7:179":"And We have committed to Hell many Jinn and humans; they had hearts with which they did not comprehend, and they had eyes with which they did not see, and they had ears with which they did not hear. They are like cattle; no, they are even more astray. These are the unaware ones","7:180":"And to God belong the beautiful names, so call Him by them; and ignore those who blaspheme in His names. They will be punished for what they used to do","7:181":"And from among those We created is a community who guides with truth, and with it they are just","7:182":"As for those who deny Our revelations, We will entice them from where they do not know","7:183":"And I will encourage them, for My scheming is formidable","7:184":"Do they not reflect Their companion has no madness; but he is a clear warner","7:185":"Did they not look at the dominion of heavens and Earth, and all that God has created Perhaps their time is drawing near; so in which narrations after this one will they believe","7:186":"Whoever God misguides, then there is none to guide him; and He leaves them blindly wandering in their transgression","7:187":"They ask you regarding the Hour: \"When will be its time\" Say: \"Its knowledge is with my Lord, none can reveal its coming except Him. It is heavy through the heavens and the Earth; it will not come to you except suddenly.\" They ask you, as if you are responsible for it! Say: \"Its knowledge is with God, but most people do not know","7:188":"Say: \"I do not posses for myself any benefit or harm, except what God wills. And if I could know the future, then I would have increased my good fortune, and no harm would have come to me. I am but a warner and a bearer of good news to a people who believe","7:189":"He is the One who created you from one person, and He made from it its mate to reside with. When he dwelled with her, she became pregnant with a light load, and she continued with it; then when it became heavy, they called on God, their Lord: \"If You give us an upright child, then we will be among the thankful","7:190":"But when He gave them an upright child, they made partners with Him in what He had given them. God be exalted above what they set up as partners","7:191":"Do they set up those who do not create anything, while they are created","7:192":"And they cannot give them aid, nor can they aid themselves","7:193":"And if you invite them to the guidance they will not follow you. It is the same whether you invite them or simply keep quiet","7:194":"Those whom you call on besides God are servants like you; so let them answer for you if you are truthful","7:195":"Do they have feet with which to walk, or do they have hands with which to strike, or do they have eyes with which to see, or do they have ears with which to hear Say: \"Call on your partners, then scheme against me. You will not be given respite","7:196":"My supporter is God who sent down the Scripture; and He takes care of the righteous","7:197":"As for those whom you call on beside Him, they cannot aid you, nor can they aid themselves","7:198":"And if you invite them to the guidance, they do not listen. And you see them looking at you, while they do not see","7:199":"Take to pardoning, and order with what is good, and turn away from the ignorant ones","7:200":"And if the devil harms you in any way, then seek refuge with God. He is the Hearer, the Knower","7:201":"Those who are pious, when any evil from the devil touches them, they remember, then they can see","7:202":"And their brethren attempt to drive them towards error, they do not cease","7:203":"And because you do not bring them a sign, they Say: \"If only you had brought one.\" Say: \"I only follow what is inspired to me from my Lord. This is an evidence from your Lord, and a guide and mercy to a people who believe","7:204":"And if the Quran is being studied, then listen to it and pay attention, that you may receive mercy","7:205":"And remember your Lord in yourself out of humility and fear and without being too loud during the morning and the evening. And do not be of the careless ones","7:206":"Those who are at your Lord, they are never too proud to serve Him, and they glorify Him, and to Him they submit","8:1":"They ask you regarding the spoils of war, Say: \"The spoils of war are for God and the messenger.\" So be aware of God, and be upright in matters between you; and obey God and His messenger if you are believers","8:2":"The believers are those whom, when God is mentioned, their hearts reverence; and when His revelations are recited to them, it increases their faith; and they put their trust in their Lord","8:3":"They hold the contact-method, and from Our provisions to them they spend","8:4":"These are the true believers; they will have grades with their Lord and a forgiveness and a generous provision","8:5":"As your Lord made you go out from your home with the truth, but a party from among the believers disliked this","8:6":"They argue with you about the truth when it has been made clear to them; as if they were being herded towards death while they are watching","8:7":"And God promises you that one of the two parties will be defeated by you; and you wish that the one least armed be the one. But God wishes that the truth be manifest with His words, and that He eliminates the remnant of the rejecters","8:8":"So that truth will be manifest, and the falsehood will be confounded; even if the criminals dislike it","8:9":"You called on help from your Lord and He answered you: \"I will provide you with one thousand Angels as defenders","8:10":"And God did not do this except to give you good news, and that your hearts may be assured by it. And victory is only from God; God is Noble, Wise","8:11":"Sleep overcame you from Him to give you peace; and He sent down to you water from the sky to cleanse you with it and cause the affliction of the devil to leave you; and so that He may strengthen your hearts and set firm your feet","8:12":"God inspired the Angels: \"I am with you so keep firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who have rejected; so strike above the necks, and strike from them every one standing","8:13":"That is because they have aggressed against God and His messenger. And whoever aggresses against God and His messenger, then God is severe in retribution","8:14":"This is for you to sample, and for the rejecters will be a retribution of Fire","8:15":"O you who believe; when you encounter those who have rejected on the battlefield, then do not flee from them","8:16":"And whoever on that day flees from them; unless it is part of the battle strategy or if he is retreating back to his group; then he has drawn God's wrath upon him, and his abode will be Hell. What a miserable destiny","8:17":"It was not you who killed them, but it was God who killed them. And it was not you who launched when you did, but it was God who launched.

But if He makes them listen, they would still turn away, averse","8:24":"O you who believe, answer the call of God and His messenger when he calls you to what will grant you life. And know that God comes between a person and his heart, and that to Him you will be gathered","8:25":"And be aware of a test that will not only afflict those of you who were wicked; and know that God is severe in retribution","8:26":"And recall when you were but a few who were weak in the land, you were fearful that men might capture you. But He sheltered you, and He supported you with His victory, and He provided you with good provisions, so that you may be thankful","8:27":"O you who believe, do not betray God and the messenger, nor betray your trust, while you know","8:28":"And know that your money and your children are a test, and that God has the greatest reward","8:29":"O you who believe, if you are aware of God, He will make for you a criterion, and He will cancel your sins and forgive you. God is possessor of great favour","8:30":"And the rejecters plot against you to arrest you, or to kill you, or to expel you. And they plot, and God plots, and God is the best of plotters","8:31":"And if Our revelations are recited to them, they Say: \"We have listened, and if we wish, we could have said the same thing. This is nothing but tales of the ancients","8:32":"And they said: \"O God, if this is the truth from You, then send down upon us a rain of stones from the sky or bring on us a painful retribution","8:33":"But God was not to punish them while you are with them, nor will God punish them while they continue to seek forgiveness","8:34":"And why should God not punish them when they are turning others away from the Restricted Temple, and they were never its protectors! Its protectors are the righteous; but most of them do not know","8:35":"And their contact-method at the sanctuary was nothing but noise and aversion. Taste the retribution for what you have rejected","8:36":"Those who have rejected, they spend their money to turn others away from the path of God. They will spend it, then it will become an anguish for them, then they are defeated. Those who rejected will be gathered to Hell","8:37":"This is so that God will distinguish the bad from the good, and so that the bad will be gathered together into one heap then He will cast it all into Hell. These are the losers","8:38":"Say to the rejecters: \"If they cease, then what has passed before will be forgiven to them, and if they return to it, then the example of the previous generations has already been given","8:39":"And fight them all until there is no more oppression, and so that the entire system is God's. But if they cease, then God is watcher over what they do","8:40":"And if they turn away, then know that God is your Patron. What an excellent Patron, and what an excellent Victor","8:41":"You should know: \"Of anything you gain, that one-fifth shall go to God and the messenger, and the relatives, and the orphans, and the poor, and the wayfarer.\" You will do this if you believe in God and in what We revealed to Our servant on the day of the Criterion, the day the two armies clashed. God is able to do all things","8:42":"When you were on the near side, and they were on the far side, then the supply line became directly beneath you. And had you planned for this meeting, you would have disagreed on its timing, but God was to enforce a command that was already done. So that He would destroy those to be destroyed with proof, and to let those who will live be alive with proof. God is Hearer, Knowledgeable","8:43":"God shows them to you as being few in your dream, and had He shown them to be many, then you would have failed and you would have disputed in the matter; it was God who saved you. He is the Knower of what is inside the chests","8:44":"And God showed them to you when you met as being few to your eyes, and He made you appear as being fewer to their eyes. That was so God's decree would come to be; and to God all matters are returned","8:45":"O you who believe, when you meet a force, stand firm and mention God excessively, that you may succeed","8:46":"And obey God and His messenger, and do not dispute else you will fail and your momentum will depart, and be patient. God is with the patient ones","8:47":"And do not be like those who came out from their homes to boast and to be seen by men, and they repel others away from the path of God. God is aware of what they do","8:48":"And the devil adorned their work for them, and he said: \"None from mankind can defeat you today, and I am by your side.\" But when the two forces came together, he turned on his heels to flee and he said: \"I am innocent from you! I see what you do not see. I fear God, and God is severe in punishment","8:49":"The hypocrites and those who have a disease in their hearts said: \"These people have been deceived by their system.\" But whoever puts his trust in God, then God is Noble, Wise","8:50":"And if you could only see as the Angels take those who have rejected, they strike their faces and their backs: \"Taste the punishment of the blazing Fire","8:51":"This is for what your hands have put forth, and God does not wrong the servants","8:52":"Like the behaviour of the people of Pharaoh, and those before them; they rejected God's signs, so God took them for their sins. God is Strong, severe in punishment","8:53":"That is because God was not to change anything He bestowed to a people, unless they change what is in themselves. God is Hearer, Knowledgeable","8:54":"Like the behaviour of Pharaoh's people and those before them. They denied the signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them by their sins, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh; all of them were wicked","8:55":"The worst creatures to God are those who reject, for they do not believe","8:56":"The ones whom you made a pledge with them, then they break their pledge every time, and they do not care","8:57":"So, when you encounter them in battle, set them as an example to those who would come after them; perhaps they may remember","8:58":"And if you are being betrayed by a people, then you shall likewise move against them. God does not like the betrayers","8:59":"And let not those who have rejected think that they have escaped; they will never avail themselves","8:60":"And prepare for them all that you can of might, and from the steeds of war, that you may instil fear with it towards God's enemy and your enemy, and others beside them whom you do not know but God knows them. And whatever you spend in the cause of God will be returned to you, and you will not be wronged","8:61":"And if they seek peace, then you also seek it, and put your trust in God. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable","8:62":"And if they wish to deceive you, then God is sufficient for you. He is the One who supported you with His victory and with the believers","8:63":"And He made unity between their hearts. And had you spent all that is on Earth, you would not have united between their hearts, but God united between them. He is Noble, Wise","8:64":"O prophet, God is sufficient for you, and whoever followed you from the believers","8:65":"O prophet, urge the believers to fight. If there are twenty of you who are patient, they will defeat two hundred. And if there are one hundred of you, they will defeat one thousand from amongst those who reject; that is because they are a people who do not comprehend","8:66":"Now, God has lightened for you, for He knows that there is weakness in you. If there are one hundred of you who are patient, they will defeat two hundred. And if there are one thousand of you, they will defeat two thousand by God's leave. God is with the patient","8:67":"And it was not for any prophet to take prisoners unless it was in battle. You desire the materials of this world, while God wants the Hereafter for you. God is Noble, Wise","8:68":"Had it not been previously ordained from God, then a severe punishment would have afflicted you for what you took","8:69":"So consume what you have gained, lawful and good, and be aware of God. God is Forgiving, Merciful","8:70":"O prophet, say to those prisoners whom you hold: \"If God finds in your hearts any good, He will grant you better than what He took from you, and He will forgive you. God is Forgiving, Merciful","8:71":"And if they want to betray you, they have already betrayed God before, and He overpowered them. God is Knowledgeable, Wise","8:72":"Those who have believed and emigrated and strived with their money and lives in the cause of God, and those who sheltered and supported; these are the allies of one another. And those who believed but did not emigrate, you do not owe them any allegiance until they emigrate. But if they seek your help in the system, then you must support them, except if it is against a people with whom there is a treaty between you. God is watcher over what you do","8:73":"As for those who reject, they are allies to one another. If you do not do this, then there will be oppression on Earth and great corruption","8:74":"And those who have believed and emigrated and strived in the cause of God, and those who sheltered and supported, these are truly the believers. They will have a forgiveness and a generous provision","8:75":"And those who believed afterwards and emigrated and strived with you, then they are from you. And the relatives by birth are also supportive of one another in God's record. God is aware of all things","9:1":"This is a revocation from God and His messenger to those with whom you have made a treaty from among those who have set up partners","9:2":"Therefore, roam the land for four months and know that you will not escape God, and that God will humiliate the rejecters","9:3":"And a declaration from God and His messenger to the people, on this, the peak day of the Pilgrimage: \"That God and His messenger are innocent from all those who set up partners.\" If you repent, then it is better for you, and if you turn away, then know that you will not escape God. And give news to those who have rejected of a painful retribution","9:4":"Except for those with whom you had a treaty from among those who have set up partners if they did not reduce anything from it nor did they plan to attack you; you shall continue the treaty with them until its expiry. God loves the righteous","9:5":"So when the restricted months have passed, then you may kill those who have set up partners wherever you find them, and take them, and surround them, and stand against them at every point. If they repent, and hold the contact-method, and contribute towards betterment, then you shall leave them alone. God is Forgiving, Merciful","9:6":"And if any of those who have set up partners seeks your protection, then you may protect him so that he may hear the words of God, then let him reach his sanctuary. This is because they are a people who do not know","9:7":"How can those who have set up partners have a pledge with God and with His messenger Except for those with whom you made a pledge near the Restricted Temple, as long as they are upright with you, then you are upright with them. God loves the righteous","9:8":"How is it that when they come upon you they disregard all ties, either those of kinship or of pledge. They seek to please you with their words, but their hearts deny, and most of them are wicked","9:9":"They purchased with God's revelations a small price, so they turn others from His path. Evil indeed is what they used to do","9:10":"They do not respect those who are believers, nor a kinship, nor a pledge. These are the transgressors","9:11":"If they repent, and they hold the contact-method, and they contribute towards betterment, then they are your brothers in the system. We explain the revelations for a people who know","9:12":"And if they break their oaths after making them, and they denounce the authority of your system; then you may kill the chiefs of rejection. Their oaths are nothing to them, perhaps they will then cease","9:13":"Would you not fight a people who broke their oaths and intended to expel the messenger, especially while they were the ones who attacked you first Do you fear them It is God who is more worthy to be feared if you are believers","9:14":"Fight them; perhaps God will punish them by your hands and humiliate them and grant you victory over them and heal the chests of the believing people","9:15":"And to remove the anger from their hearts; God pardons whom he pleases. God is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:16":"Or did you think that you would be left alone God will come to know those of you who strived and did not take other than God and His messenger and the believers as helpers. God is Expert in what you do","9:17":"It was not for those who have set up partners to maintain God's temples while they bear witness over their own rejection. For these, their works have fallen, and in the Fire they will abide","9:18":"Rather, the temples of God are maintained by he who believes in God and the Last Day, and he holds the contact-method, and he contributes towards betterment, and he does not fear except God. It is these that will be of the guided ones","9:19":"Have you made the watering of the pilgrim and the maintenance of the Restricted Temple the same as one who believes in God and the Last Day and he strives in the cause of God They are not the same with God. And God does not guide the wicked people","9:20":"Those who believed and emigrated and strived in the cause of God with their wealth and their lives are in a greater degree with God. These are the winners","9:21":"Their Lord gives them good news of a Mercy from Him, and acceptance, and gardens that are for them in which there is permanent bliss","9:22":"They will abide in it eternally. God has a great reward","9:23":"O you who believe, do not take your fathers nor brothers as allies if they prefer rejection to belief. And whoever of you takes them as such, then these are the wicked","9:24":"Say: \"If your fathers, and your sons, and your brothers, and your wives, and your clan, and money which you have gathered, and a trade which you would fear if it declines, and homes which you find pleasing; if these are dearer to you than God and His messenger and striving in the cause of God, then wait until God brings His decision. God does not guide the wicked people","9:25":"God has granted you victory in many battles. And on the day of Hunayn when you were pleased with your great numbers but it did not help you at all, and the land became tight around you for what it held, then you turned to flee","9:26":"Then God sent down tranquility upon His messenger and the believers, and He sent down soldiers which you did not see, and He punished those who disbelieved. Such is the recompense of the rejecters","9:27":"Then God will accept the repentance of whom He pleases after that. God is Forgiving, Merciful","9:28":"O you who believe, those who have set up partners are impure, so let them not approach the Restricted Temple after this calendar year of theirs; and if you fear poverty, then God will enrich you from His blessings if He wills. God is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:29":"Fight those who do not believe in God or the Last Day, and they do not forbid what God and His messenger have forbidden, and they do not uphold the system of truth; from among the people who have been given the Scripture; until they pay the fine, willingly or unwillingly","9:30":"The Jews said: \"Uzair is God's son,\" and the Nazarenes said: \"The Messiah is God's son.\" Such is their utterances with their mouths, they imitate the sayings of those who rejected before them. God will fight them. They are deluded from the truth","9:31":"They took their Priests and Monks to be patrons besides God, and the Messiah son of Mary, while they were only commanded to serve One god, there is no god but He, be He glorified for what they set up","9:32":"They want to extinguish God's light with their mouths, but God refuses such and lets His light continue, even if the rejecters hate it","9:33":"He is the One who sent His messenger with guidance and the system of truth, to make it expose all other systems, even if those who set up partners hate it","9:34":"O you who believe, many of the Priests and Monks consume people's money in falsehood, and they turn away from the path of God. And those who hoard gold and silver, and do not spend it in the cause of God, give them news of a painful retribution","9:35":"On the Day when they will be seared in the fires of Hell, and their foreheads and sides and backs will be branded with it: \"This is what you have hoarded for yourselves, so taste what you have hoarded","9:36":"The count of the months with God is twelve months in God's record the day He created the heavens and the Earth; four of them are restricted. This is the correct system; so do not wrong yourselves in them; and fight those who set up partners collectively as they fight you collectively. And know that God is with the righteous","9:37":"Know that accelerating the intercalary is an addition in rejection, to misguide those who have rejected by it. They make it lawful one calendar year, and they forbid it one calendar year, so as to circumvent the count that God has made restricted; thus they make lawful what God made forbidden! Their evil works have been adorned for them, and God does not guide the rejecting people","9:38":"O you who believe, what is wrong with you when you are told: \"March forth in the cause of God,\" you become heavy on Earth. Have you become content with this worldly life over the Hereafter The enjoyment of this worldly life compared to the Hereafter is nothing","9:39":"If you do not march forth, then He will punish you with a painful retribution, and He will replace you with another people, and you do not bother Him in the least. God is capable of all things","9:40":"If you do not help him, then God has helped him. When those who rejected expelled him, he was one of only two, and when they were in the cave, he said to his friend: \"Do not grieve, for God is with us.\" So God sent down calmness over him and He supported him with soldiers that you did not see, and He made the word of those who rejected be the lowest, and God's word be the highest. God is Noble, Wise","9:41":"March forth in light gear or heavy gear, and strive with your money and lives in the cause of God. That is best if you knew","9:42":"If it were a near gain, or an easy journey, they would have followed you; but the distance was too much for them. And they will swear by God: \"If we could have, we would have come with you.\" They destroy themselves, and God knows they are liars","9:43":"God pardons you; why did you give them leave before it became clear to you who are truthful, and who are lying","9:44":"Those who believe in God and the Last Day will not ask leave. They strive with their money and their lives. And God is aware of the righteous","9:45":"Those who ask leave are the ones who do not believe in God and the Last Day, and their hearts are in doubt. In their doubts they are wavering","9:46":"And if they had gone with you then they would have taken all precautions for it, but God disliked them coming forth, so He made them lag behind, and they were told: \"Stay with those who have stayed","9:47":"Had they come out with you they would have added nothing but disruption, and they would have hurried about seeking to cause for you an ordeal; and there are some amongst you who listen to them. God is aware of the wicked","9:48":"They wanted to cause an ordeal from before, and they turned matters upside down for you until the truth came and God's command was revealed, while they hated it","9:49":"And from them are those who Say: \"Grant me leave, and do not test me.\" But it is in the test that they have indeed fallen, and Hell is surrounding the rejecters","9:50":"When any good befalls you, it upsets them, and if any bad befalls you, they Say: \"We have made our precautions beforehand,\" and they turn away happy","9:51":"Say: \"Nothing will befall us except what God has decreed for us, He is our Patron.\" And in God the believers shall put their trust","9:52":"Say: \"You can only expect for us one of two good things; while we wait for you to be afflicted by God with a retribution from Him, or by our hands. So wait, we are with you waiting","9:53":"Say: \"Spend willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you. You are a wicked people","9:54":"And what prevented what they would spend from being accepted from them except that they rejected God and His messenger, and they do not attend to the contact-method except lazily, and they do not spend except unwillingly","9:55":"So do not be impressed by their wealth or children; God only wishes to punish them with it in the worldly life, and so that their lives will end while they are rejecters","9:56":"And they swear by God that they are with you, while they are not with you; but they are a people who are indecisive","9:57":"If they find a refuge, or cave, or any place to enter, then they would have run to it while they are in haste","9:58":"And from them are those who criticize you regarding the charities.

If We pardon one group from you, We will punish another group. That is because they were criminals","9:67":"The hypocrite men and women, they are to each other. They order evil and deter from good, and they close their hands. They forgot God, so God forgot them; the hypocrites are the wicked","9:68":"God has promised the hypocrite men and women and the rejecters a Fire in Hell, in it they will abide; it will be enough for them. And God has cursed them and they will have a lasting retribution","9:69":"Like those before them, they were more powerful than you, and with more wealth and offspring. They enjoyed their lives, and you enjoyed your lives as those before you enjoyed their lives; and you jested as they jested. They had their work crumble in this world and the next, and they were the losers","9:70":"Did the news not come to them of those before them, the people of Noah and 'Aad and Thamud, and the people of Abraham, and the dwellers of Median, and those overthrown.

And the acceptance from God is the most important; such is the greatest success","9:73":"O prophet, strive against the rejecters and the hypocrites and be firm against them. Their dwelling is Hell, what a miserable destiny","9:74":"They swear by God that they did not say it, while they had said the word of rejection, and they rejected after they had surrendered, and they were concerned with what they could not possess; and they could not find any fault except that God and His messenger had enriched them from His bounty. If they repent it is better for them, and if they turn away, then God will punish them severely in this world and the next. They will not have on Earth any ally or supporter","9:75":"And from them are those who pledged to God: \"If He gives us from His bounty, then we will believe and we will be amongst the upright","9:76":"So when He gave them of His bounty, they became stingy with it, and they turned away while they were averse","9:77":"Thus, hypocrisy followed in their hearts until the Day they meet Him; that is for breaking what they promised God, and for what they were lying","9:78":"Did they not know that God knows their secrets, and their conspiracies, and that God is the knower of all the unseen","9:79":"Those who criticize the volunteers among the believers in charities; that they only have their effort to give; so they mock them.

So let them be, for they are foul, and their destiny is Hell as a recompense for what they earned","9:96":"They swear to you so that you would accept them. Even if you accept them, God does not accept the wicked people","9:97":"The Nomads are the worst in rejection and hypocrisy, and more likely not to know the limits of what God has sent down upon His messenger.

They will have the misfortune of evil, and God is Hearer, Knowledgeable","9:99":"And from the Nomads are those who believe in God and the Last Day, and he looks upon what he spends to make him closer to God, and the contact-methods with the messenger. It indeed makes them closer. God will admit them in His mercy; God is Forgiving, Merciful","9:100":"And those who came early and quickly from amongst the emigrants and the supporters, and those who followed them in kindness; God has accepted them, and they have accepted Him; and He prepared for them gardens with rivers flowing beneath in which they will abide eternally.

The devil is to man a clear enemy","12:6":"And as such, your Lord has chosen you, and He teaches you the interpretation of dreams, and He completes His blessings upon you and upon the descendants of Jacob, as He completed it for your fathers before that, Abraham and Isaac. Your Lord is Knowing, Wise","12:7":"It is thus that in Joseph and his brothers are signs for those who seek","12:8":"For they said: \"Joseph and his brother are more loved by our father than us, while we are a numerous group. Our father is clearly misguided","12:9":"Kill Joseph or cast him in the land, then your father's favour will be all yours, and after that you will be an upright people","12:10":"One amongst them said: \"Do not kill Joseph, but if you are going to do anything, then cast him into the bottom of the well, so that anyone traveling by will pick him up","12:11":"They said: \"Our father, why do you not trust us with Joseph, we are to him well wishers","12:12":"Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy and play, and we will take care of him","12:13":"He said: \"It saddens me that you should take him, and I fear that the wolf would eat him if you would be absent of him","12:14":"They said: \"If the wolf eats him, while we are a numerous group, then we are the losers","12:15":"So, when they went with him they had agreed to place him at the bottom of the well. And We inspired to him: \"You will inform them of this act of theirs while they will not expect it","12:16":"And they came to their father evening time crying","12:17":"They said: \"Our father, we went to race and left Joseph by our things, and the wolf ate him! But you would not believe us even if we are truthful","12:18":"And they came with his shirt stained in false blood. He said: \"You have invented this tale yourselves. Patience is good, and God's help is sought against what you describe","12:19":"And a traveling caravan came and they sent their man to draw water, but when he drew he said: \"Good news, there is a boy!\" So they hid him as merchandise. And God is aware of what they do","12:20":"And they sold him for a low price, a few silver coins, and they regarded him as insignificant","12:21":"And the one from Egypt who bought him said to his wife: \"Make his stay generous, perhaps he will benefit us or we may take him as a son.\" And it was thus that We established Joseph in the land and to teach him the interpretation of dreams. And God has full power over matters, but most of mankind do not know","12:22":"And when he reached his maturity, We gave him position and knowledge. It is thus that We reward the good doers","12:23":"And the woman, in whose house he was staying, attempted to seduce him away from himself. And she closed the doors and said: \"I have prepared myself for you.\" He said: \"I seek refuge with God, He is my Lord, He made good my residence; the wicked do not succeed","12:24":"And she desired him and he desired her, had it not been that he saw His Lord's proof; it was thus that We turned evil and lewdness away from him; he is of Our loyal servants","12:25":"And as they rushed towards the door, she tore his shirt from behind; and they found her master at the door. She said: \"What is the punishment of he who wanted to molest your family Is it not that he be jailed or punished painfully","12:26":"He said: \"She is the one who seduced me from myself,\" and a witness from her family gave testimony: \"If his shirt was torn from the front, then she is truthful, and he is the liar","12:27":"And if his shirt is torn from behind, then she is lying, and he is truthful","12:28":"So when he saw that his shirt was torn from behind, he said: \"This is from your female scheming, your female scheming is indeed great","12:29":"Joseph, turn away from this. And you woman, seek forgiveness for your sin; you were of the wrongdoers","12:30":"And some women in the city said: \"The wife of the Governor is trying to seduce her young man from himself; she is taken by love. We see her clearly misguided","12:31":"So when she heard of their scheming, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them, and she gave each one of them a knife. And she said: \"Come out to them,\" so when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands, and they said: \"God be praised, this is not a human, but a blessed Angel","12:32":"She said: \"This is the one whom you blamed me for, and I have seduced him from himself but he refused. And if he does not do as I command him, he will be imprisoned, and he will be one of those disgraced","12:33":"He said: \"My Lord, prison is better to me than what they are inviting me to do. And if You do not turn their scheming away from me, I will fall for them and be of the ignorant","12:34":"So his Lord responded to him, and He turned away their scheming from him. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable","12:35":"But it appealed to them, even after they had seen the signs, to imprison him until a time","12:36":"And with him in the prison entered two young men. One of them said: \"I dreamt that I was pressing wine,\" and the other said: \"I dreamt that I was carrying bread on top of my head, and that the birds were eating from it.\" \"Tell us what this means, for we see that you are of the good doers","12:37":"He said: \"There is not any provision of food that will come to you except that I will tell you of its interpretation before it comes. That is from what my Lord has taught me. I have just left the creed of a people who do not believe in God, and they are rejecting the Hereafter","12:38":"And I followed the creed of my fathers: Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. It was not for us to set up partners with God at all. That is God's blessings over us and over mankind, but most of mankind are not thankful","12:39":"O my fellow inmates, are various lords better, or God, the One, the Omniscient","12:40":"What you serve besides God is nothing but names which you have created you and your fathers, God did not send down any authority for such. The judgment is for none but God. He ordered that none be served but He. That is the true system, but most of mankind do not know","12:41":"My fellow inmates, one of you will be serving wine for his lord, while the other will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head. The matter which you have sought is now concluded","12:42":"And he said to the one whom he thought would be saved of them: \"Mention me to your lord.\" But the devil made him forget to mention to his lord, so He remained in prison for a few years","12:43":"And the King said: \"I continue to dream of seven fat cows which are being eaten by seven thin ones, and seven green pods and others which are dry. O you commanders, tell me what my vision means if you are able to interpret the visions","12:44":"They said: \"It is nothing but bad dreams; and we are not knowledgeable in the interpretation of dreams","12:45":"And the one of them who had been saved and remembered after all this time said: \"I will tell you of its interpretation, so have me dispatched","12:46":"Joseph, O man of truth, explain to us the matter regarding seven fat cows being eaten by seven thin ones, and seven green pods and others which are dry Then perhaps I may go back to the people so they will know","12:47":"He said: \"You will plant regularly for seven years, and whatever you harvest you must leave it in its pods, except for the little that you will eat","12:48":"Then will come seven after that which are severe in drought and which will consume all that you plant except for what you have stored","12:49":"Then after that will come a calendar year in which the people will have abundant rain and which they will be able to produce once again","12:50":"And the King said: \"Bring him to me.\" So when the messenger came to him, he said: \"Go back to your lord and ask him what was the matter regarding the women that cut their hands My Lord is well aware of their scheming","12:51":"He said: \"What is your plea that you tried to seduce Joseph from himself\" They said: \"God forbid that we would do any harm to him.\" The wife of the Governor said: \"Now the truth must be known, I did seek to seduce Joseph from himself and he is of the truthful ones","12:52":"That is so he knows that I will not betray him while he is not present and that God does not guide the scheming of the betrayers","12:53":"And I do not make myself free of blame, for the soul is inclined to sin, except what my Lord has mercy on. My Lord is Forgiving, Merciful","12:54":"And the King said: \"Bring him to me so that I may employ him to my person.\" So when he spoke to him, he said: \"Today you are with us in high rank and trusted","12:55":"He said: \"Make me keeper over the granaries of the land, for I know how to keep records and I am knowledgeable","12:56":"And it was such that We gave Joseph authority in the land, to travel in it as he pleases. We bestow Our mercy upon whom We please, and We do not waste the reward of the good doers","12:57":"And the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and were aware","12:58":"And Joseph's brothers came and entered upon him, and he recognized them, but they did not recognize him","12:59":"So, when he furnished them with their provisions, he said: \"Bring me a step-brother of yours who is from your father. Do you not see that I give full measure of grain and that I am the best of hosts","12:60":"But if you do not bring him to me, then there shall be no measure of grain for you with me, and do not come near me","12:61":"They said: \"We will try to get him away from his father, and we shall be successful","12:62":"And he said to his servants: \"Return their goods back into their bags, so that they will recognize it when they return to their family and they will come back again","12:63":"So when they returned to their father, they said: \"Our father, we have been banned from getting anymore measure of grain, so send our brother with us so we may be given measure of grain, and we will be his guardians","12:64":"He said: \"Shall I trust him with you as I trusted you with Joseph before that God is the best guardian, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy","12:65":"So when they opened their bags, they found their goods had been returned to them, and they said: \"Our father, what more can we desire, this is our goods returned to us, so we can get more for our family, and be guardians over our brother, and increase a measure of grain to load a camel. That is truly an easy measure","12:66":"He said: \"I will not send him with you until you come to me with a covenant to God that you will bring him back unless you are completely overtaken\". So when they brought him the covenant, he said: \"God is placed in trust over what we say","12:67":"And he said: \"My sons, do not enter from one gate, but enter from separate gates; and I cannot avail you anything against God, for the judgment is to God. In Him I put my trust, and in Him those who put their trust should trust","12:68":"And when they entered from where their father had commanded them, it would not have availed them in the least against God, but it was out of a concern in Jacob's soul that he brought out. And he is with knowledge for what We have taught him, but most men do not know","12:69":"And when they entered upon Joseph, he called his brother to himself and said: \"I am your brother, so do not be saddened by what they have done","12:70":"So when he furnished them with their provisions, he placed the measuring bowl in his brothers bag, then a caller cried out: \"O you in the caravan, you are thieves","12:71":"They said, while coming towards him: \"What is it you are missing","12:72":"He said: \"We are missing the measuring bowl of the King, and for whomever can produce it, we will give a camel's load, and I will be bound by this","12:73":"They said: \"By God, you know we did not come to cause corruption in the land, and we are no thieves","12:74":"He said: \"What shall be the punishment, if you are not truthful","12:75":"They said: \"The punishment is that whomever it is found in his bags, then to compensate is his punishment. It is such that we punish the wicked","12:76":"So he began with their bags before his brother's bag. Then he brought it out of his brother's bag. It was such that We planned for Joseph, for he would not have been able to take his brother under the King's system, except that God wished it so. We raise the degrees of whom We please, and over every one of knowledge is the All Knowledgeable","12:77":"They said: \"If he has stolen, there was a brother of his before who also had stolen.\" Joseph kept this all inside himself, and did not reveal anything to them. He said: \"You are in an awkward position, and God best knows what you describe","12:78":"They said: \"O Governor, he has an elderly father, so take one of us in his place. Indeed we see you as one of the good doers","12:79":"He said: \"God forbid that we would take anyone except he whom we found our belongings with. Indeed, we would then be wrong doers","12:80":"So when they gave-up from him, they held a conference in private. The eldest of them said: \"Did you not know that your father has taken a covenant over you with God, and before this you also failed in your duty with Joseph I will not leave this land until my father permits me to do so or that God will judge for me. He is the best of judges","12:81":"Return to your father, and tell him: \"Our father, your son has stolen, and we did not witness except what we learned, and we could not know the unseen","12:82":"And ask the people of the town which we were in, and the caravan which we have returned with. We are being truthful","12:83":"He replied: \"No, for it is your own souls that have conspired you to this. So patience is most fitting, perhaps God will bring them all to me. He is the Knowledgeable, the Wise","12:84":"And he turned away from them and said: \"Oh, my sorry over Joseph.\" And his eyes turned white from sadness, and he became blind","12:85":"They said: \"By God, will you never cease to remember Joseph until you become senile or you are dead","12:86":"He said: \"I merely complain my grief and sorrow to God, and I know from God what you do not know","12:87":"My sons, go and inquire about Joseph and his brother, and do not give-up from God's Spirit. The only people who would give-up from God's Spirit are the rejecters of faith","12:88":"So when they entered upon him, they said: \"O Governor, we have been afflicted with harm, us and our family, and we have come with poor goods to trade, so give us a measure of grain, and be charitable towards us, for God does reward the charitable","12:89":"He said: \"Do you know what you have done with Joseph and his brother, while you are ignorant","12:90":"They said: \"Are you indeed Joseph\" He said: \"I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God has been gracious to us. For anyone who reveres God and is patient, then God will not waste the reward of the good doers","12:91":"They said: \"By God, God has indeed preferred you over us and we were wrongdoers","12:92":"He said: \"There is no blame on you this day, may God forgive you, and He is the most Merciful of those who show mercy","12:93":"Take this shirt of mine and cast it over my fathers face, and he will become with sight; and bring to me all your family","12:94":"And when the caravan departed, their father said: \"I do indeed feel the scent of Joseph, except that you may think me senile","12:95":"They said: \"By God, you are back to your old misguidance","12:96":"Then, when the bearer of good news came, he cast it over his face and he returned clear with sight. He said: \"Did I not tell you that I know from God what you do not know","12:97":"They said: \"Our father, ask forgiveness for our sins, indeed we have been wrong","12:98":"He said: \"I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful","12:99":"So when they entered upon Joseph, he took his parents to him and he said: \"Enter Egypt, God willing, in security","12:100":"And he raised his parents on the throne, and they fell in prostration to Him. And he said: \"My father, this is the interpretation of my vision from before. My Lord has made it true, and He has been good to me that he took me out of prison and brought you out of the wilderness after the devil had placed a rift between me and my brothers. My Lord is kind to whom He wills. He is the Knowledgeable, the Wise","12:101":"My Lord, you have given me sovereignty and taught me the interpretations of what is supposed. Initiator of the heavens and Earth, you are my protector in this world and the Hereafter. Take me as one who has surrendered, and join me with the good doers","12:102":"That is from the news of the unseen that We inspire to you. You were not amongst them when they arranged their plan and were scheming","12:103":"And most of the people, even if you are diligent, will not believe","12:104":"And you do not ask them for a wage for it, it is but a reminder to the worlds","12:105":"And how many a sign in the heavens and the Earth do they pass by, while they are turning away from it","12:106":"And most of them will not believe in God except while setting-up partners","12:107":"Are they secure against the coming of a cover of retribution from God, or that the Hour would come to them suddenly while they do not perceive","12:108":"Say: \"This is my way, I invite to God in full disclosure, myself and whomever follows me. And glory be to God. And I am not of those who set up partners","12:109":"And We have not sent before you except men, to whom We gave inspiration, from the people of the towns. Would they not roam the Earth and see how was the punishment of those before them And the abode of the Hereafter is far better for those who are aware. Do you not comprehend","12:110":"Then, when the messengers gave up, and they thought that they have been denied, Our victory came to them. We then save whom We wish, and Our punishment cannot be swayed from the wicked people","12:111":"In their stories is a lesson for the people of intelligence. It was not a narration that was invented, but an authentication of what is already present and a detailing of all things, and a guidance and mercy to a people who believe","13:1":"L.M.R. These are the signs of the Scripture. And what has been sent down to you from your Lord is the truth; but most of the people do not believe","13:2":"God, Who raised the skies without any pillars that you can see, then He settled to the throne, and He commissioned the sun and the moon; each running to a fixed destiny. He manages all affairs, and He details the signs so that you will be aware of the meeting with your Lord","13:3":"And He is the One who stretched-out the land, and made in it stabilizers and rivers, and from every fruit He made a pair of two; the night covers the day. In that are signs for a people who will think","13:4":"And on Earth are neighbouring pieces of land with gardens of grape and plants and palm trees, some of which may be twin sharing the same root, or single, even though they are being watered with the same water source; and We make preference for some of them over others in what they consume. In that are signs for a people who comprehend","13:5":"And if you are surprised, then what is more surprising is their saying: \"Can it be that when we are dust, we will be created anew!\" These are the ones who rejected their Lord, and they will have chains around their necks, and they are the dwellers of the Fire, in it they will abide","13:6":"And they hasten towards you with sin before good, and the examples of those before them have already been given. Your Lord is with great forgiveness to mankind for their transgression, and your Lord is severe in retribution","13:7":"And those who reject Say: \"If only a sign was sent down to him from his Lord.\" You are but a warner, and to every nation is a guide","13:8":"God knows what every female carries, and how short her pregnancy or how long. And everything with Him is measured","13:9":"The knower of the unseen and the seen, the Great, the most High","13:10":"It is the same whether any of you openly declares what he says, or conceals it; whether he is hiding in the night or going openly in the day","13:11":"Present with him and behind him are retainers, they guard him by God's command. God is not to change what is in a people until they change what is within themselves. And if God wanted to harm a people, then there is no turning Him back, nor will they have any protector against Him","13:12":"He is the One who shows you the lightning, giving you fear and hope. And He establishes the heavy clouds","13:13":"And the thunder glorifies with His praise, and the Angels are in awe of Him, and He sends the thunderbolts, and strikes with it whom He will. Yet they are still arguing regarding God, while He is severe in punishment","13:14":"To Him is the call of truth. And those who are called on besides Him, they will not respond to them in anything; like one who places his hands openly in the water to drink, but it never reaches his mouth. The call of the rejecters is nothing but in misguidance","13:15":"And to God submit all who are in the heavens and the Earth, willingly and unwillingly, as do their shadows in the morning and the evening","13:16":"Say: \"Who is the Lord of the heavens and Earth,\" Say: \"God.\" Say: \"Have you taken besides Him allies who do not posses for themselves any benefit or harm\" Say: \"Is the blind and the seer the same, or does the darkness and the light equate Or have they made partners with God who have created like His creation, so the creations all seemed the same to them\" Say: \"God has created all things, and He is the One, the Supreme","13:17":"He sent down water from the sky, so valleys flowed according to their capacity, and the flood produces foam. And from what they burn to smelt jewellery or goods is produced a similar foam. It is in such a manor that God strikes the falsehood with the truth. As for the foam, it passes away, and as for what benefits mankind, it remains in the Earth. It is such that God cites the examples","13:18":"For those who responded to their Lord is goodness. As for those who did not respond to Him, if they had all that is in the Earth twice over, they would offer it to be saved. To these will be a terrible reckoning, and their abode is Hell; what a miserable abode","13:19":"Is one who knows that the truth has been sent down to you from your Lord like one who is blind Only those with understanding will remember","13:20":"Those who fulfill God's pledge, and they do not break the Covenant","13:21":"And those who deliver what God has ordered be delivered, and they revere their Lord and they fear the terrible reckoning","13:22":"And those who are patient seeking their Lord's direction; and they hold the contact-method, and they spend from what We bestowed upon them secretly and openly, and they counter sin with good; these will have an excellent abode","13:23":"The gardens of Eden, they will enter it with those who are good doers from their fathers and their mates and their progeny. And the Angels will enter upon them from every gate","13:24":"Peace be upon you for what you have been patient for. Excellent indeed is the final abode","13:25":"As for those who break the pledge of God after making its covenant, and they sever what God ordered that it be delivered, and they corrupt in the Earth; to those is a curse and they will have a miserable abode","13:26":"God gives the provisions for whom He wishes, and He is able. And they were happy with the worldly life, but the worldly life compared to the Hereafter was nothing but a brief enjoyment","13:27":"And those who have rejected Say: \"If only a sign were sent down to him from his Lord!\" Say: \"God misguides whom He wishes and guides to Him whoever is repenting","13:28":"The ones who believed and their hearts are relieved by the remembrance of God; for in God's remembrance the hearts are relieved","13:29":"And those who believed, and did good works, there will be happiness for them and a good abode","13:30":"And as such, We have sent you to a nation as other nations that have come before, so that you may recite for them that which has been inspired to you; while they are still rejecting the Almighty. Say: \"He is my Lord, there is no god but He, in Him I place my trust and to Him is my repentance","13:31":"And if a Quran were to be used to move mountains, or to slice the Earth, or the dead were spoken to with it. No, to God is all matters. Did not those who believe know that if God wished He would have guided all the people As for those who reject, they continue to be stricken with disaster or it comes near to their homes, until God's promise comes true. God does not break the appointment","13:32":"And messengers before you were ridiculed, but I gave time to those who rejected, then I took them. Then how was My punishment","13:33":"The One who is standing over every soul for what it has earned; yet they make partners with God. Say: \"Name them, or are you informing Him of what He does not know on Earth or is it just a show of words\" But to the rejecters, their scheming is made to appear clever, and they are turned away from the path. And whoever God misguides will have no guide","13:34":"They will have a punishment in the worldly life, and the punishment of the Hereafter is more difficult. And they will have no defender against God","13:35":"The example of Paradise that the righteous have been promised, is that rivers flow beneath it, and its provisions are continuous as is its shade. Such is the abode of those who were righteous, while the abode of the rejecters is the Fire","13:36":"And those to whom We have previously given the Scripture rejoice at what has been sent down to you, but there are some of the groups that reject parts of it. Say: \"I am only ordered to serve God and not join any partner with Him. To Him I pray and to Him is the return","13:37":"And as such, We have sent it down a law in Arabic. And if you follow their desires after what has come to you of the knowledge, then you will not have any ally or defender against God","13:38":"And We have sent messengers before you and We have made for them mates and offspring. It was not for a messenger to come with any sign except by God's leave, but for every time there is a decree","13:39":"God erases what He wishes and affirms, and with Him is the source of the Scripture","13:40":"And if We show you some of what We promise them or if We let you pass away, then you are only to deliver while for Us is the reckoning","13:41":"Do they not see that We come to the land and reduce it from its ends And God gives judgment and there is none to override His judgment. And He is quick to reckoning","13:42":"And those before them have schemed, but to God is all scheming. He knows what every soul earns and the rejecters will come to know to whom is the better abode","13:43":"And those who reject Say: \"You are not a messenger.\" Say: \"God is sufficient as a witness between me and you, the One who has the knowledge of the Scripture","14:1":"L.R. A Scripture which We have sent down to you so that you may take the people out of the darkness and into the light by their Lord's leave to the path of the Noble, the Praiseworthy","14:2":"God, to whom belongs all that is in the heavens, and all that is in the Earth. And woe to the rejecters from a painful retribution","14:3":"The ones who have preferred the worldly life over the Hereafter, and they repel away from the path of God, and they seek to make it crooked. Those are the ones who are in misguidance","14:4":"And We have not sent any messenger except in the language of his people, so he may clarify to them. But God misguides whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills. And He is the Noble, the Wise","14:5":"And We have sent Moses with Our signs, that you should bring your people out from the darkness and into the light, and remind them with God's revelations. In this are signs for any who are patient and thankful","14:6":"And Moses said to his people: \"Remember God's blessings upon you that He saved you from the people of Pharaoh. They used to inflict the worst punishment upon you, and they used to murder your children, and rape your women. And in that was a great trial from your Lord","14:7":"And your Lord proclaimed: \"If you give thanks, then I will increase for you, but if you are rejecting, then My retribution is severe","14:8":"And Moses said: \"If you reject, you and all who are on Earth together, then know that God is Rich, Praiseworthy","14:9":"Did not news come to you of those before you: the people of Noah, and 'Aad, and Thamud, and those after them whom none know but God Their messengers came to them with clarity, but they placed their hands to their mouths and said: \"We are rejecting what you have been sent with, and we are in grave doubt as to what you are inviting us to","14:10":"Their messengers said: \"Is there doubt regarding God, the initiator of the heavens and the Earth He invites you so that He may forgive some of your sins, and grant you until a predetermined time.\" They said: \"You are but humans like us, you wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to serve. So come to us with clear proof","14:11":"Their messengers said: \"We are but humans like you, but God will bestow His grace upon whom He pleases from His servants. And it is not up to us to bring you proof except by God's leave.

And in God those who trust should put their trust","14:13":"And those who rejected said to their messengers: \"We will drive you out of our land, or you will return to our creed.\" It was then that their Lord inspired to them: \"We will destroy the wicked","14:14":"And We will let you reside in the land after them. That is for those who fear My station and fear My deliverance","14:15":"And they sought victory, and every arrogant tyrant was then made to lose","14:16":"From behind him is Hell, and he will be served boiling water","14:17":"He tries to drink it, but it cannot be swallowed, and death comes to him from everywhere, but he will not die; and from behind him is a powerful retribution","14:18":"The example of those who reject their Lord is that their works are like ashes, on which the wind blows strongly on a stormy day, they cannot get anything of what they earned.

He is best to reward, and best to punish","18:45":"And give them the parable of this worldly life is like a water which We have sent down from the sky, so that the plants of the Earth mix with it and it becomes murky being moved by the wind. And God is capable of all things","18:46":"Wealth and buildings are the beauty of this life. But the good deeds that remain behind are better with your Lord for a reward, and better for hope","18:47":"And the Day We move the mountains, and you see the Earth barren, and We gather them. We did not forget anyone of them","18:48":"And they are displayed before your Lord as a column: \"You have come to Us as We had created you the first time. No, you claimed We would not make for you an appointed time","18:49":"And the record was displayed, so you see the criminals fearful of what is in it. And they Say: \"Woe to us!, what is wrong with this record that it does not leave out anything small or large except that it has counted it.\" And they found what they had done present. And your Lord does not wrong anyone","18:50":"And We said to the Angels: \"Submit to Adam.\" So they all submitted except for Satan, he was of the Jinn, so he disobeyed the order of his Lord. \"Will you take him and his progeny as allies besides Me, while they are your enemy\" Miserable for the wicked is the substitute","18:51":"I did not make them witness the creation of heavens and Earth, nor the creation of themselves. Nor do I take the misleaders as helpers","18:52":"The Day when He says: \"Call on your partners that you had claimed.\" So they called them, but they did not respond to them. And We made between them a barrier","18:53":"And the criminals saw the Fire, and they realized they will be placed in it, and they did not find any way to avert it","18:54":"And We have cited in this Quran every example for the people. But man was always most argumentative","18:55":"And what prevented the people from believing when the guidance came to them, and to seek forgiveness from their Lord Are they waiting for what happened to the people of old to come to them, or that the retribution be brought to them face to face","18:56":"And We do not send the messengers except as bearers of good news and warners. But those who reject will argue using falsehood to overshadow the truth with it. And they took My revelations and what they have been warned by as a joke","18:57":"And who is more wicked than one who is reminded of his Lord's verses but he turned away from them, and he forgot what his hands had done. We have made veils upon their hearts from understanding them, and a deafness in their ears. And if you invite them to the guidance, they will never be guided","18:58":"And your Lord is forgiving, with mercy. If He were to judge the people for what they had already earned, He would hasten for them the retribution. No, they have an appointment, beyond which they will find no escape","18:59":"And such are the towns which We had destroyed when they transgressed. And We made for their destruction an appointed time","18:60":"And Moses said to his youth: \"I will not stop until I reach the junction of the two seas, or I spend a lifetime trying","18:61":"But when they did reach the junction between, they forgot their fish, and it was able to make its way back to the sea in a stream","18:62":"And when they had passed further on, he said to his youth: \"Bring us our lunch; we have found much fatigue in this journey of ours","18:63":"He said: \"Do you remember when we rested upon the rock I forgot the fish, and it was the devil that made me forget to remember it. It made its way back to the sea amazingly","18:64":"He said: \"That is what we have been seeking!\" So they went back retracing their steps","18:65":"So they came upon a servant of Ours whom We had given him mercy from Us and We taught him knowledge from Us","18:66":"Moses said to him: \"Can I follow you so that you will teach me from the guidance you have been taught","18:67":"He said: \"You will not be able to have patience with me","18:68":"And how can you be patient about that which you have not been given any news","18:69":"He said: \"You will find me, God willing, to be patient. And I will not disobey any command of yours","18:70":"He said: \"If you follow me, then do not ask about anything until I relate it to you","18:71":"So they ventured forth until they rode in a boat and he made a hole in it. He said: \"Did you make a hole in it to drown its people You have done something dreadful","18:72":"He said: \"Did I not tell you that you will not be able to have patience with me","18:73":"He said: \"Forgive me for what I forgot, and do not be hard upon my request with you","18:74":"So they ventured forth until they came upon a youth, and he killed him.

You will then have a reason over me","18:77":"So they ventured forth until they came to the people of a town. They requested food from its people but they refused to host them. Then they found a wall which was close to collapsing, so he built it. He said: \"If you wished, you could have asked a wage for it","18:78":"He said: \"For this, we will now part ways. I will inform you of the meanings of those things that you could not have patience over","18:79":"As for the boat, it belonged to some poor people who were working the sea, so I wanted to damage it as there was a king coming who takes every boat by force","18:80":"And as for the youth, his parents were believers, so we feared that he would oppress them by his transgression and disbelief","18:81":"So we wanted their Lord to replace for them with one who is better than him in purity and closer to mercy","18:82":"And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphaned boys in the city, and underneath it was a treasure for them, and their father was a good man, so your Lord wanted that they would reach their maturity and take out their treasure as a mercy from your Lord. And none of what I did was of my own accord. That is the meaning of what you could not have patience for","18:83":"And they ask you about the one who is from Two Eras, Say: \"I will recite to you a memory from him","18:84":"We had facilitated for him in the land, and We had given him the means of everything","18:85":"So he followed the means","18:86":"Until he reached the setting of the sun, and he found it setting at a boiling lake, and he found near it a people.

It is an easy thing for Me. And I had created you before when you were not even anything","19:10":"He said: \"My Lord, make for me a sign.\" He said: \"Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three nights consecutively","19:11":"So he went out amongst his people from the temple enclosure, and he indicated to them that they should glorify Him morning and evening","19:12":"O John, take the Scripture with confidence.\" And We gave him authority while in his youth","19:13":"And he had kindness from Us and purity, and he was ever righteous","19:14":"And dutiful to his parents, and never was he a tyrant or disobedient","19:15":"And peace be upon him the day he was born, and the day he dies, and the Day he is resurrected alive","19:16":"And relate in the Scripture Mary, when she withdrew herself from her family to a place which was to the east","19:17":"She took to a barrier which separated her from them, so We sent Our spirit to her, and he took on the shape of a human in all similarity","19:18":"She said: \"I seek refuge with the Almighty from you if you are a person of faith","19:19":"He said: \"I am the messenger of your Lord, to give you the gift of a pure son","19:20":"She said: \"How can I have a son when no man has touched me, nor do I desire such","19:21":"He said: \"It is such that your Lord has said, it is easy for Me. And We shall make him a sign for mankind and a mercy from Us. It is a matter already ordained","19:22":"So she was pregnant with him, and she went to deliver in a far place","19:23":"Then the birth pains came to her, by the trunk of a palm tree. She said: \"I wish I had died before this, and became totally forgotten","19:24":"But then he called to her from beneath her: \"Do not be sad, your Lord has made below you a stream","19:25":"And shake the trunk of this palm tree, it will cause ripe dates to fall upon you","19:26":"So eat and drink and be happy. If you see any human being, then Say: \"I have declared a fast for the Almighty, and I will not talk today to any of mankind","19:27":"Then she came to her people carrying him. They said: \"O Mary, you have come with something totally unexpected","19:28":"O sister of Aaron, your father was not a bad man, and your mother was never unchaste","19:29":"So she pointed to him. They said: \"How can we talk to someone who is a child in a cradle","19:30":"He said: \"I am God's servant, He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet","19:31":"And He made me blessed wherever I was, and He charged me with the contact-method and towards betterment as long as I am alive","19:32":"And to be dutiful to my mother, and He did not make me a rebellious tyrant","19:33":"And peace be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the Day I am resurrected alive","19:34":"Such was Jesus, the son of Mary, and this is the truth of the matter in which they doubt","19:35":"God was never to take a son, be He glorified. If He decrees a matter, then He simply says to it: \"Be,\" and it is","19:36":"And God is my Lord and your Lord, so serve Him. This is a straight path","19:37":"So the parties disputed between them. Therefore, woe to those who have rejected from the scene of a terrible Day","19:38":"Listen to what they say and watch on the Day they come to Us. But the wicked today are in clear misguidance","19:39":"And warn them of the Day of remorse. When the matter is decided while they are oblivious, and they do not believe","19:40":"It is We who will inherit the Earth and all that is on it. And to Us they will return","19:41":"And recall in the Scripture Abraham; he was a man of faith, a prophet","19:42":"When he said to his father: \"O father, why do you serve what does not hear or see, nor help you in anything","19:43":"My father, knowledge has come to me which did not come to you. So follow me that I will guide you to a good path","19:44":"My father, do not serve the devil. For the devil was ever disobedient to the Almighty","19:45":"My father, I fear that a retribution will inflict you from the Almighty and that you will become an ally to the devil","19:46":"He said: \"Have you abandoned my gods O Abraham If you do not stop this, I will stone you. Leave me alone","19:47":"He said: \"Peace be upon you, I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. He has been most kind to me","19:48":"And I will abandon you and what you call on besides God. And I will call on my Lord. I hope that I will not be mischievous in calling upon my Lord","19:49":"So when he abandoned them and what they serve besides God, We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and We made each a prophet","19:50":"And We granted them from Our mercy, and We made for them a tongue of truth to be heard","19:51":"And recall in the Scripture Moses; he was loyal, and he was a messenger prophet","19:52":"And We called him from the right side of the mount, and We brought him close to talk with","19:53":"And We granted him from Our mercy his brother Aaron as a prophet","19:54":"And recall in the Scripture Ishmael; he was truthful to his promise, and he was a messenger prophet","19:55":"And he used to instruct his family with the contact-method and towards betterment, and his Lord was pleased with him","19:56":"And recall in the Scripture Enoch; he was a man of truth, a prophet","19:57":"And We raised him to a high place","19:58":"Those are the ones whom God has blessed from amongst the prophets from the progeny of Adam, and those We carried with Noah, and from the progeny of Abraham and Israel, and from whom We have guided and chosen. When the revelations of the Almighty are recited to them, they fall down prostrating, and in tears","19:59":"Then generations came after them who lost the contact-method, and followed desires. They will find their consequences","19:60":"Except for whoever repents and believes and does good work; they will be admitted to Paradise, and they will not be wronged in the least","19:61":"The gardens of Eden, which the Almighty had promised His servants in the unseen. His promise must come to pass","19:62":"They will not hear in it any nonsense, only peace. And they will have their provision in it morning and evening","19:63":"Such is Paradise that We inherit to any of Our servants who are righteous","19:64":"And we are not sent except by the command of your Lord. To Him is our present and our future, and all that is in-between. And your Lord was never to forget","19:65":"The Lord of the heavens and the Earth and what is in-between them. So serve Him and be patient in His service. Do you know anything that is like Him","19:66":"And man says: \"Can it be that when I am dead, I will be brought out alive","19:67":"Does man not remember that We created him before that and he was nothing at all","19:68":"By your Lord, We will gather them and the devils, then We will place them around Hell on their knees","19:69":"Then We will drag out from every group which of them was the worst opposition to the Almighty","19:70":"Then, it is We who are best aware of those who deserve to be burnt therein","19:71":"And every single one of you must pass by it. This for your Lord is a certainty that will come to pass","19:72":"Then We will save those who were righteous, and We leave the wicked in it on their knees","19:73":"And when Our clear revelations were recited to them, those who rejected said to those who believed: \"Which of the two groups of ours is more in authority and more prosperous","19:74":"And how many generations have We destroyed before them They had more wealth and more influence","19:75":"Say: \"Whoever is in misguidance, then the Almighty will lead them on.\" Until they see what they have been promised, either the retribution or the Hour. Then they will know who is in a worst place and weaker in power","19:76":"And God increases the guidance of those who are guided. And what remains of good is better with your Lord as a reward and a far better return","19:77":"Did you see the one who rejected Our revelations and said: \"I will be given wealth and children","19:78":"Did he look into the future Or has he taken a pledge with the Almighty","19:79":"No, We will record what he says, and We will increase for him the retribution significantly","19:80":"Then We inherit from him all that he said, and he shall come to Us all alone","19:81":"And they have taken gods besides God to be for them their glory","19:82":"On the contrary, they will reject their service of them and they will be standing against them","19:83":"Did you not see that We send the devils upon the rejecters to drive them into evil","19:84":"So do not be impatient; for We are preparing for them a preparation","19:85":"The Day We gather the righteous to the Almighty as a delegation","19:86":"And We drive the criminals to Hell as a herd","19:87":"None will posses intercession, except for he who has taken a pledge with the Almighty","19:88":"And they said the Almighty has taken a son","19:89":"You have come with a gross blasphemy","19:90":"The heavens are about to shatter from it, and the Earth crack open, and the mountains fall and crumble","19:91":"That they claimed that the Almighty had a son","19:92":"And what need does the Almighty have to take a son","19:93":"When all there is in the heavens and the Earth will but come to the Almighty as servants","19:94":"He has encompassed them, and counted them one by one","19:95":"And all of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection, all alone","19:96":"Those who believe and do good works, the Almighty will bestow them with love","19:97":"Thus We have made this easy in your tongue so that you may give good news with it to the righteous and that you may warn with it the quarrelsome people","19:98":"And how many a generation have We destroyed before them Do you perceive any of them or hear from them a sound","20:1":"T'. H","20:2":"We did not send down to you the Quran so you may suffer","20:3":"It is but a reminder for the one who takes heed","20:4":"Sent down from the One who created the Earth and the heavens above","20:5":"The Almighty, on the throne He settled","20:6":"To Him is what is in the heavens and what is in the Earth, and what is in between, and what is underneath the soil","20:7":"And if you declare openly what you say, He knows the secret and what is hidden","20:8":"God, there is no god but He, to Him are the beautiful names","20:9":"And did the news of Moses come to you","20:10":"When he saw a fire, so he said to his family: \"Stay here, I have seen a fire, perhaps I can bring from it something, or find at the fire some guidance","20:11":"So when he came to it he was called: \"O Moses","20:12":"I am your Lord, so take off your slippers, you are in the holy valley Tawa","20:13":"And I have chosen you, so listen to what is being inspired","20:14":"I am God, there is no god but Me, so serve Me and hold the contact-method for My remembrance","20:15":"The Hour is coming, I am nearly keeping it hidden, so that every soul will be recompensed with what is strived","20:16":"So do not be deterred from it by he who does not believe in it and followed his desire and perished","20:17":"And what is in your right hand O Moses","20:18":"He said: \"It is my staff, I lean on it, and I guide my sheep with it, and I have other uses in it","20:19":"He said: \"Cast it down O Moses","20:20":"So he cast it down, and it became a moving serpent","20:21":"He said: \"Take it and do not be fearful, We will turn it back to its previous form","20:22":"And place your hand under your arm, it will come out white without blemish, as another sign","20:23":"This is to show you Our great signs","20:24":"Go to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed","20:25":"He said: \"My Lord, relieve for me my chest","20:26":"And make my mission easy","20:27":"And remove the knot in my tongue","20:28":"So they can understand what I say","20:29":"And allow for me an advisor from my family","20:30":"Aaron, my brother","20:31":"So that I may strengthen my resolve through him","20:32":"And share with him my mission","20:33":"So that we may glorify You plenty","20:34":"And remember You plenty","20:35":"You Have been watcher over us","20:36":"He said: \"You have been given what you asked O Moses","20:37":"And We Have graced you another time","20:38":"When We inspired to your mother what was inspired","20:39":"That she should cast him in the basket, and cast the basket in the sea, so the sea will place him on the shore, where an enemy of Mine and his will take him. And I placed upon you a love from Me and that you shall be raised under My eye","20:40":"That your sister should follow, and Say: \"Shall I guide you to a person who will nurse him\" Thus We returned you to your mother, so that she may be pleased and not be sad. And you killed a person, but We saved you from harm and We tested you greatly. So it was that you stayed with the people of Median for many years, then you came here by fate O Moses","20:41":"And I Have raised you for Myself","20:42":"Go, you and your brother with Our signs, and do not linger from My remembrance","20:43":"Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed","20:44":"So say to him soft words, perhaps he will remember or take heed","20:45":"They said: \"Our Lord, we fear that he would let loose upon us, or transgress","20:46":"He said: \"Do not fear, I am with you, I hear and I see","20:47":"So come to him and Say: \"We are messengers from your Lord, so send with us the Children of Israel, and do not punish them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord, and peace be upon those who follow the guidance","20:48":"It has been inspired to us that the retribution will be upon he who denies and turns away","20:49":"He said: \"So who is the lord of you both O Moses","20:50":"He said: \"Our Lord is the One who gave everything its creation, then guided","20:51":"He said: \"What then has happened to the previous generations","20:52":"He said: \"It's knowledge is with my Lord, in a record. My Lord does not err or forget","20:53":"The One who made for you the Earth habitable and He made ways for you in it, and He brought down water from the sky, so We brought out with it pairs of vegetation of all types","20:54":"Eat and raise your livestock, in that are signs for those of thought","20:55":"From it We created you and in it We return you, and from it We bring you out another time","20:56":"And We showed him Our signs, all of them, but he denied and refused","20:57":"He said: \"Have you come to us to take us out of our land with your magic O Moses","20:58":"We will bring you a magic like it, so let us make an appointment between us and you which neither of us will break, a place where we both agree","20:59":"He said: \"Your appointment is the day of festival, and when the people start crowding during the late morning","20:60":"So Pharaoh went away, and he gathered his scheming then he came","20:61":"Moses said to them: \"Woe to you, do not invent lies about God, else the retribution will take you, and miserable is the one who invents","20:62":"So they disputed in their matter between themselves, and they kept secret their council","20:63":"They said: \"These are but two magicians who want to take you out of your land with their magic, and they want to do away with your ideal way","20:64":"So agree your scheme, then come as one front. Whoever wins today will succeed","20:65":"They said: \"O Moses, either you cast down or we will be the first to cast down","20:66":"He said: \"No, you cast down.\" So their ropes and staffs appeared from their magic as if they were moving","20:67":"And Moses held some fear in himself","20:68":"We said: \"Do not fear, you will best them","20:69":"And cast down what is in your right hand it will consume what they have made. They have only made the work of a magician, and the magician will not succeed no matter what he does","20:70":"So the magicians went down in prostration. They said: \"We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses","20:71":"He said: \"Have you believed to him before taking my permission He is surely your great one who has taught you magic. So, I will cut off your hands and feet from alternate sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of the palm trees, and you will come to know which of us is greater in retribution and more lasting","20:72":"They said: \"We will not prefer you over the proofs that have come to us, and over the One who initiated us. So issue whatever judgment you have, for you only issue judgment in this worldly life","20:73":"We have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins, and what you had forced us into doing of magic. And God is better and everlasting","20:74":"He who comes to his Lord as a criminal, he will have Hell, where he will neither die in it nor live","20:75":"And he who comes to Him as a believer doing good works, for those will be the highest ranks","20:76":"The gardens of Eden with rivers flowing beneath them, abiding therein. Such is the reward of he who is developed","20:77":"And We inspired to Moses: \"Take My servants out, and make for them through the sea a path. You shall not fear being overtaken, nor be afraid","20:78":"So Pharaoh followed them with his soldiers, but the sea came-over them and covered them","20:79":"Thus, Pharaoh misled his people and he did not guide","20:80":"O Children of Israel, We have saved you from your enemy, and We summoned you at the right side of the mount, and We sent down to you manna and quail","20:81":"Eat from the good things that We have provided for you and do not transgress in this else My wrath will be upon you. Whomever has incurred My wrath is lost","20:82":"And I am forgiving for whomever repents and does good work, then is guided","20:83":"And what has caused you to rush ahead of your people O Moses","20:84":"He said: \"They are coming in my tracks, and I came quickly to you my Lord so you would be pleased","20:85":"He said: \"We have tested your people after you left, and the Samarian misguided them","20:86":"So Moses returned to his people angry and disappointed. He said: \"My people, did not your Lord promise you a good promise Has the waiting been too long, or did you want that the wrath of your Lord be upon you Thus you broke the promise with me","20:87":"They said: \"We did not break the promise by our own will, but we were loaded down with the jewellery of the people so we cast them down, and it was such that the Samarian suggested","20:88":"He then produced for them a statue of a calf that emitted a sound. So they said: \"This is your god and the god of Moses, but he had forgotten","20:89":"Did they not see that it did not respond to them, nor did it possess for them any harm or benefit","20:90":"And Aaron said to them before: \"My people, you are being tested with it. Your Lord is the Almighty, so follow me and obey my command","20:91":"They said: \"We will remain devoted to it until Moses comes back to us","20:92":"He said: \"O Aaron, what prevented you when you saw them being astray","20:93":"Do you not follow me Have you disobeyed my command","20:94":"He said: \"O son of my mother, do not grab me by my beard nor by my head. I feared that you would say that I separated between the Children of Israel, and that I did not follow your orders","20:95":"He said: \"So what do you have to say O Samarian","20:96":"He said: \"I noticed what they did not notice, so I took a handful from where the messenger was standing, and I cast it in. This is what my soul inspired me to do","20:97":"He said: \"Then be gone, for you will have it in this life to Say: \"I am not to be touched\" And you will have an appointed time which you will not forsake. And look to your god that you remained devoted to, we will burn him, then we will destroy him in the sea completely","20:98":"Your god is God; whom there is no god but He. His knowledge encompasses all things","20:99":"And it is such that We relate to you the news of what has passed. And We have given you from Us a remembrance","20:100":"Whoever turns away from it, then he will carry a load on the Day of Resurrection","20:101":"They will remain therein, and miserable on the Day of Resurrection is what they carry","20:102":"The Day the horn is blown, and We gather the criminals on that Day white eyed","20:103":"They whisper amongst themselves: \"You have only been away for a period of ten","20:104":"We are fully aware of what they say, for the best in knowledge amongst them will Say: \"No, you have only been away for a day","20:105":"And they ask you about the mountains, Say: \"My Lord will annihilate them completely","20:106":"Then He will leave it as a smooth plain","20:107":"You will not see in it any crookedness or curves","20:108":"On that Day, they will follow the caller, there is no crookedness to him. And all voices will be humbled for the Almighty, you will not be able to hear except whispers","20:109":"On that Day, no intercession will be of help, except for he whom the Almighty allows and accepts what he has to say","20:110":"He knows their present and their future, and they do not have any of His knowledge","20:111":"And the faces shall be humbled for the Eternal, the Living. And whoever carried wickedness with him has failed","20:112":"And whoever does any good works, while he is a believer, then he should not fear injustice nor being given less than his due","20:113":"And it was such that We sent it down as an Arabic Quran, and We cited in it many warnings, perhaps they will become aware or it will cause for them a remembrance","20:114":"Then High above all is God, the King, the True. And do not be hasty with the Quran before its inspiration is completed to you, and Say: \"My Lord, increase my knowledge","20:115":"And We had made a pledge to Adam from before, but he forgot, and We did not find in him the will power","20:116":"And We said to the Angels: \"Submit to Adam.\" They all submitted except for Satan, he refused","20:117":"So We said: \"O Adam, this is an enemy to you and your mate. So do not let him take you out from the paradise, else you will have hardship","20:118":"You will have in it that you will not go hungry nor need clothes","20:119":"And you will have in it that you will not go thirsty nor suffer from heat","20:120":"But the devil whispered to him, he said: \"O Adam, shall I lead you to the tree of immortality and a kingdom which will not waste away","20:121":"So they both ate from it, and their wickedness became apparent for them, and they began to place leaves on themselves from the garden. Adam had disobeyed his Lord, and had gone astray","20:122":"Then his Lord recalled him, and He forgave him and gave guidance to him","20:123":"He said: \"Descend from this, all of you, for you are enemies to one another. So, when My guidance comes to you, then whoever follows My guidance, he will not go astray nor suffer","20:124":"And whoever turns away from My remembrance, then he will have a miserable life, and We will raise him blind on the Day of Resurrection","20:125":"He said: \"My Lord, you have raised me blind while I used to be able to see","20:126":"He said: \"It was the same when Our revelations came to you, you forgot them, and similarly today you will be forgotten","20:127":"And it is such that We recompense he who transgresses, and did not believe in His Lord's revelations. And the retribution of the Hereafter is more severe and lasting","20:128":"Is it not a guide to them how many generations We had destroyed before them, which they are walking now in their homes In that are signs for the people of understanding","20:129":"And had it not been for a word already given by your Lord, they would have been held to account immediately","20:130":"So be patient to what they are saying and glorify the grace of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting, and from the early part of the night glorify, and at the edges of the day that you may be content","20:131":"And do not strain your eyes on what We have given other people as luxuries of this worldly life, where We are testing them with it. The provision of your Lord is better and more lasting","20:132":"And instruct your family with the contact-method, and be patient for it. We do not ask you for provision, for We provide for you. And the good end is for the righteous","20:133":"And they said: \"If only he would bring us a sign from his Lord!\" Did not proof come to them from what is in the previous Scriptures","20:134":"And if We had destroyed them with retribution before this, they would have said: \"Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger so we could follow Your revelations before we are humiliated and shamed","20:135":"Say: \"All are waiting, so wait, and you will come to know who are the people upon the even path and who are guided","21:1":"The judgment of mankind has come near, while they are turning away unaware","21:2":"When a reminder comes to them from their Lord that is new, they listen to it while playing","21:3":"Their hearts are preoccupied, and those who are wicked confer privately: \"Is he not a human being like you Would you accept this magic while you know","21:4":"He said: \"My Lord knows what is said in the heavens and in the Earth, and He is the Hearer, the Knower","21:5":"They said: \"No, these are just bad dreams; no, he made it up; no, he is a poet. So let him bring us a sign like those who were sent before","21:6":"None of the towns which We destroyed before them had believed. Will they believe","21:7":"And We did not send before you except men whom We inspired to. So ask the people of the remembrance if you do not know","21:8":"And We did not make for them bodies that do not need to eat, nor were they immortal","21:9":"Then We fulfilled the promise to them, so We saved them and whom We pleased, and We destroyed those who transgressed","21:10":"We have sent down to you a Scripture in which is your remembrance. Do you not comprehend","21:11":"And how many a town have We destroyed because of its wrong doing, and We established after them a different people","21:12":"So it was that when they perceived Our power, they were running from it","21:13":"Do not run, and come back to that which you were living lavishly in and your homes; so that you will be questioned","21:14":"They said: \"Woe to us, we have been wicked","21:15":"So that remained as their cry until We took them all, and they became still","21:16":"And We did not create the heavens and the Earth and what is between them for entertainment","21:17":"If We wanted to be amused, We could have done so from what is already with Us, if that is what We wished to do","21:18":"No, We cast with the truth upon the falsehood, so it disrupts it, and then it retreats. And woe to you for what you have described","21:19":"And to Him is whoever is in the heavens and in the Earth. And those who are near Him are not too proud to serve Him, nor do they complain","21:20":"They glorify in the night and the day, they do not cease","21:21":"Or have they taken gods from the Earth who can resurrect","21:22":"If there were gods in them except for God, then they would have been ruined. Glory be to God, the Lord of the throne from what they describe","21:23":"He is not questioned about what He does, while they will be questioned","21:24":"Or have they taken gods besides Him Say: \"Bring your proof. This is a reminder of those with me and a reminder of those before me.\" But, most of them do not know the truth, so they turn away","21:25":"And We did not send any messenger before you except that We inspired him that: \"There is no god but Me, so serve Me","21:26":"And they said: \"The Almighty has taken a son!\" Be He glorified, they are all but honoured servants","21:27":"They do not speak ahead of Him, and on His command they act","21:28":"He knows their present and their future, and they cannot intercede unless it is for those whom He is pleased with. And they stand in awe and reverence of Him","21:29":"And whoever of them says: \"I am a god besides Him,\" then that person We will punish with Hell. It is such that We punish the wicked","21:30":"Did those who reject not see that the heavens and the Earth were one piece and We tore them apart And that We made from the water everything that lives. Will they not believe","21:31":"And We made on the Earth stabilizers so that it would not tumble with you, and We made in it wide paths that they may be guided","21:32":"And We made the sky a protective ceiling.

And they will not be able to turn it away, nor will they be delayed","21:41":"And messengers before you have been mocked, but those who mocked were then surrounded by that which they were mocking","21:42":"Say: \"Who can protect you during the night and the day from the Almighty\" No, they are turning away from the remembrance of their Lord","21:43":"Or do they have gods that will protect them from Us They cannot help themselves, nor can they be protected from Us","21:44":"It was Us who gave luxury to these and their fathers, until they grew old with age. Do they not see that We come to the land and make it shrink from its edges Will they be able to win","21:45":"Say: \"I am merely warning you with the inspiration.\" But the deaf do not hear the call when they are being warned","21:46":"And if a breath of your Lord's torment touches them, they will Say: \"Woe to us, we have been wicked","21:47":"And We will place the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so that no soul will be wronged in the least. Even if it was the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it. And We are sufficient as a Reckoner","21:48":"And We had given Moses and Aaron the Criterion, a shining light, and reminder for the righteous","21:49":"Those who reverence their Lord, even when unseen, and they are weary for the Hour","21:50":"And this is a blessed reminder which We have sent down. Will you be deniers of it","21:51":"And before that We gave Abraham his understanding, and We were aware of him","21:52":"As he said to his father and people: \"What are these statues to which you are devoted","21:53":"They said: \"We found our fathers worshipping them","21:54":"He said: \"You and your fathers have been clearly misguided","21:55":"They said: \"Have you come to us with the truth, or are you simply playing","21:56":"He said: \"No, your lord is the Lord of heavens and Earth, the One who initiated them. And I bear witness to such","21:57":"And by God, I will scheme against your statues after you have gone away and given your backs","21:58":"So he broke them into pieces except for the biggest of them, so that they may turn to him","21:59":"They said: \"Who has done this to our gods He is surely one of the wicked","21:60":"They said: \"We heard a young man mentioning them. He was called Abraham","21:61":"They said: \"Bring him before the eyes of the people so that they may be witness","21:62":"They said: \"Did you do this to our gods O Abraham","21:63":"He said: \"It was the biggest one of them here who did it, so ask them, if they do speak","21:64":"So they turned and said to themselves: \"It is indeed ourselves who have been wicked","21:65":"Then they reverted to their old ideas: \"You know that they do not speak","21:66":"He said: \"Do you serve besides God that which does not benefit you at all nor harm you","21:67":"I am fed-up of you and to what you serve besides God! Do you not comprehend","21:68":"They said: \"Burn him, and give victory to your gods if you will do anything","21:69":"We said: \"O fire, be cool and safe upon Abraham","21:70":"And they wanted to harm him, but We made them the losers","21:71":"And We saved him and Lot to the land which We have blessed in for the worlds","21:72":"And We granted him Isaac and Jacob as a gift, and each of them We made a good doer","21:73":"And We made them leaders who guide by Our command, and We inspired them to do good work and hold the contact-method and contribute towards betterment, and they were in service to Us","21:74":"And Lot, We gave him wisdom and knowledge, and We saved him from the town that used to do vile things. They were a people of evil, corrupt","21:75":"And We admitted him into Our mercy. He was of the good doers","21:76":"And Noah when he called out before that, thus We responded to him, and We saved him and his family from the great distress","21:77":"And We granted him victory against the people that denied Our revelations. They were a people of evil, so We drowned them all","21:78":"And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment in the case of the crop that was damaged by the sheep of the people, and We were witness to their judgment","21:79":"So We gave Solomon the correct understanding, and both of them We have given wisdom and knowledge. And We committed the mountains with David to praise as well as the birds. This is what We did","21:80":"And We taught him the making of armour for you to protect you from your enemy. Are you then thankful","21:81":"And to Solomon the gusting winds run by his command all the way to the land which We have blessed in. And We were aware of everything","21:82":"And from the devils are those who dive for him, and they perform other tasks, and We were guardian over them","21:83":"And Job when he called his Lord: \"I have been afflicted with harm, and you are the Most Merciful","21:84":"So We answered him, and We removed what was afflicting him, and We brought him back his family and others with them as a mercy from Us and a reminder to those who serve","21:85":"And Ishmael and Enoch and Isaiah, all of them were patient","21:86":"And We admitted them in Our mercy, they were of the good doers","21:87":"And Jonah, when he went off in anger, and he thought that We would not be able to take him.

And it is such that We save the faithful","21:89":"And Zachariah when he called out to his Lord: \"My Lord, do not leave me without an heir, and You are the best inheritor","21:90":"So We responded to him, and We granted him John, and We cured his wife. They used to hasten to do good, and they would call to Us in joy and in fear. And to Us they were reverent","21:91":"And the one who protected her chastity, so We blew into her from Our Spirit, and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds","21:92":"This is your nation, one nation, and I am your Lord so serve Me","21:93":"And they disputed in the matter amongst themselves. Each of them will be returned to Us","21:94":"So whosoever does good work and he is a believer, then his efforts will not be rejected and We will record it for him","21:95":"It is forbidden for a town that We destroy that they would return","21:96":"Until Gog and Magog is opened, and from every elevated place they will race forth","21:97":"And the promise of truth draws near. Then, when it is seen by the eyes of those who rejected: \"Woe to us, we have been oblivious to this. Indeed, we were wicked","21:98":"Both you and what you serve besides God shall be fuel for Hell; you will enter it","21:99":"If these were gods, then they would not have entered it! And all will abide therein","21:100":"They will be breathing heavily in it, and they will not be heard therein","21:101":"As for those who deserved good from Us, they will be removed far away from it","21:102":"They shall not hear the slightest sound from it, and they will be in what their soul desires abiding therein","21:103":"The great horror will not sadden them, and the Angels will receive them: \"This is your Day which you have been promised","21:104":"On the Day when We roll up the heavens like the scroll of a scripture is rolled up. As We initiated the first creation, so shall We return it. It is a promise of Ours that We will do this","21:105":"And We have written in the Psalms: \"After the remembrance, that the Earth will be inherited by My servants who do good","21:106":"In this is a proclamation for a people who serve","21:107":"And We have not sent you except as a mercy to the worlds","21:108":"Say: \"It is inspired to me that your god is but One god, so will you surrender to Him","21:109":"So if they turn away, then Say: \"I have given you notice sufficiently, and I do not know if what you are promised is near or far","21:110":"He knows that which is spoken publicly and He knows that which you keep secret","21:111":"And for all I know, it may be a test for you and an enjoyment for a while","21:112":"He said: \"My Lord, judge with truth. And our Lord, the Almighty, is sought for what you describe","22:1":"O mankind, be aware of your Lord, for the quaking of the Hour is a terrible thing","22:2":"The moment you see it, every nursing mother will leave her suckling child, and every pregnant one will miscarry, and you will see the people drunk while they are not drunk, but the retribution of God is most severe","22:3":"And from mankind is he who argues regarding God without knowledge, and he follows every rebellious devil","22:4":"It was decreed for him that any who follow him, he will mislead him, and guide him to the retribution of Fire","22:5":"O mankind, if you are in doubt as to the resurrection, then We have created you from dirt, then from a seed, then from an embryo, then from a fetus developed and undeveloped so that We make it clear to you.

So eat from it and feed the needy and the poor","22:29":"Then let them complete their duties and fulfill their vows, and let them partake at the ancient sanctuary","22:30":"Thus, and whosoever honours God's restrictions, then it is better for him with His Lord. And the livestock is made lawful for you except what is recited upon you. So avoid the foulness of idols and avoid saying false statements","22:31":"Monotheists to God, not setting up anything with Him. And whosoever sets-up partners with God, then it is as if he has fallen from the sky and the birds snatch him or the wind takes him to a place far off","22:32":"Thus, and whoever honours the decrees of God, then it is from the piety of the hearts","22:33":"In them are benefits to an appointed time, then their place is to the ancient sanctuary","22:34":"And for every nation We have made a rite that they may mention God's name over what He has provided for them of the animal livestock.

It was thus that We have made them in service to you, that you may be thankful","22:37":"Neither their meat nor their blood reaches God, but what reaches Him is the righteousness from you. It was thus that He made them in service to you, so that you may glorify God for what He has guided you to, and give news to the good doers","22:38":"God defends those who believe. God does not like any betrayer, rejecter","22:39":"It is permitted for those who have been persecuted to fight.

God will give victory to those who support Him. God is Powerful, Noble","22:41":"Those whom if We allow them authority in the land, they hold the contact-method, and they contribute towards betterment, and deter from evil. And to God is the conclusion of all matters","22:42":"And if they deny you, then denied also before them did the people of Noah and 'Aad and Thamud","22:43":"And the people of Abraham and the people of Lot","22:44":"And the dwellers of Median; and Moses was denied. So I granted respite to the rejecters then I took them, how then was My punishment","22:45":"So how many a town have We destroyed while it was doing wrong, so that it is lying in ruins with its wells abandoned, and empty palaces","22:46":"Have they not roamed the land and had hearts with which to comprehend and ears with which to hear No, it is not the sight which is blind, but it is the hearts that are in the chests that are blind","22:47":"And they seek you to hasten the retribution; and God will not break His promise. And a day with your Lord is like one thousand of the years you count","22:48":"And many a town I have given it respite while it was doing wrong, then I seized it! And to Me is the destiny","22:49":"Say: \"O mankind, I am but a clear warner to you","22:50":"As for those who believe and do good work, for them is a forgiveness and a great provision","22:51":"And those who strive to obstruct Our revelations, those are the dwellers of Hell","22:52":"And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet, without having the devil interfere with his wishes. God then overrides what the devil has cast, and God firms His revelations. And God is Knower, Wise","22:53":"That He may make what the devil has cast as a tests for those who have a disease in their hearts and those whose hearts are hardened. And the wicked are far away in opposition","22:54":"And to let those who have been given knowledge know that it is the truth from your Lord, and they will believe in it, and their hearts will soften to it. And God will guide those who believe to a straight path","22:55":"And those who have rejected will remain to be in doubt from it until the Hour comes to them suddenly, or the retribution will come to them on a Day which will stand still","22:56":"The sovereignty on that Day is to God, He will judge between them. So as for those who have believed and did good works, they are in the gardens of Paradise","22:57":"And those who rejected and disbelieved Our revelations, those will have a humiliating retribution","22:58":"And those who emigrated in the cause of God, then they were killed or died, God will provide them with a good provision, and God is the best of providers","22:59":"He will admit them an entrance that they will be pleased with, and God is Knowledgeable, Compassionate","22:60":"It is decreed that whoever retaliates with equal measure as was retaliated against him, then he was persecuted for this, God will give him victory. God is Pardoning, Forgiving","22:61":"That is because God merges the night in the day, and He merges the day in the night. And God is Hearer, Seer","22:62":"That is because God is the truth, and what they call on besides Him is falsehood. And God is the High, the Great","22:63":"Did you not see that God sends down water from the sky, and then the land becomes green God is Compassionate, Expert","22:64":"To Him is what is in the heavens and what is in the Earth. And God is the Rich, the Praiseworthy","22:65":"Did you not see that God commits to you what is in the land, and the ships which sail in the sea by His leave And He holds the sky so that it would not collapse upon the Earth, except by His leave. Indeed, God is Kind towards mankind, Merciful","22:66":"He is the One who gave you life, then He makes you die, then He gives you life. But mankind is always rejecting","22:67":"For every nation We have made rites which they will fulfill. So do not let the matter fall into dispute. And call upon your Lord, for you are on a guidance which is straight","22:68":"And if they argue with you, then Say: \"God is fully aware of what you do","22:69":"God will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection in what you dispute therein","22:70":"Did you not know that God knows what is in the heavens and the Earth All is in a record. All that for God is easy","22:71":"And they serve besides God what He did not send any authority upon, and what they have no knowledge of. And the wicked will not have any helper","22:72":"And if Our clear revelations are recited to them, you see hatred in the faces of those who have rejected. They are nearly close to attacking those who are reciting to them Our revelations! Say: \"Shall I inform you of what is worse than this The Fire, which God has promised to those who have rejected. What a miserable destiny","22:73":"O mankind, an example is being cited so listen to it: those you call upon besides God will not create a fly even if they all gathered to do so. And if the fly takes anything from them, they will not be able to return it from him. Weak is both the seeker and the sought","22:74":"They have truly underestimated God's power. God is Powerful, Noble","22:75":"God chooses messengers from amongst the Angels and from amongst mankind. God is Hearer, Seer","22:76":"He knows their present and their future. And to God all matters are returned","22:77":"O you who believe, kneel and prostrate and serve your Lord and do good that you may succeed","22:78":"And strive in the cause of God its truly deserved striving. He is the One who has chosen you, and He has made no hardship for you in the system, the creed of your father Abraham; He is the One who named you 'those who have surrendered' from before as well as in this. So let the messenger be witness over you and you be witness over mankind. So hold the contact-method and contribute towards betterment and hold tight to God, He is your patron. What an excellent Patron, and what an excellent Supporter","23:1":"The believers are indeed successful","23:2":"Those who are humble in their contact-method","23:3":"And they abstain from vain talk","23:4":"And they are active towards betterment","23:5":"And they cover their private parts","23:6":"Except around their mates, or those who are their dependants, they are free from blame","23:7":"But whosoever seeks anything beyond this, then these are the transgressors","23:8":"And those who are true to what they have been entrusted and their pledges","23:9":"And those who maintain the contact-methods","23:10":"These are the inheritors","23:11":"The ones who shall inherit Paradise, in it they will abide","23:12":"We have created mankind from a structure derived from mud","23:13":"Then We made him a seed in a safe lodging","23:14":"Then We created the seed into an embryo, then We created the embryo into a fetus, then We created the fetus into bone, then We covered the bone with flesh, then We brought forth a new creation. So glory be to God, the best of creators","23:15":"Then after that, you will die","23:16":"Then you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection","23:17":"And We have created above you seven passageways, and We were never unaware of the creations","23:18":"And We sent down from the sky water in due measure, then We let it reside in the land, and We are capable of taking it away","23:19":"So We brought forth for you gardens of palm trees and grapes, for which you will find many fruits and from it you will eat","23:20":"And a tree which emerges from the mount of Sinai, it grows oil and is a relish for those who eat","23:21":"And in the livestock are lessons for you. We give you to drink from what is in its bellies, and you have many other benefits from them, and of them you eat","23:22":"And on them and on the ships you are carried","23:23":"And We have sent Noah to his people, so he said: \"O my people, serve God, you have no other god besides Him. Will you not take heed","23:24":"But the leaders who rejected from among his people said: \"What is this but a human like you He wants to make himself better than you! And if it was indeed God's will, He would have sent down Angels. We did not hear such a thing among our fathers of old","23:25":"He is no more than a man who has madness in him. So keep watch on him for a while","23:26":"He said: \"My Lord, grant me victory for what they denied me","23:27":"So We inspired him: \"Construct the Ship under Our eyes and Our inspiration. Then, when Our command comes and the volcano erupts, then you shall take on the Ship two from every pair and your family, except for those of them upon whom the word has come. And do not address Me regarding those who have done wrong, for they will be drowned","23:28":"So when you and those who are with you have embarked on the ship, then Say: \"All praise is due to God who has saved us from the wicked people","23:29":"And Say: \"My Lord, cause me to embark upon a blessed place, for You are the best for those who embark","23:30":"In this are signs, and We will always test","23:31":"Then We raised after them a different generation","23:32":"So We sent a messenger to them from amongst them: \"Serve God, you have no other god besides Him. Will you not take heed","23:33":"And the leaders from amongst his people who rejected and denied the meeting of the Hereafter; and We indulged them in this worldly life; said: \"What is this but a human like you He eats from what you eat and he drinks from what you drink","23:34":"And if you obey a human like you, then you will indeed be losers","23:35":"Does he promise you that if you die and become dust and bones that you will be brought out","23:36":"Far fetched is what you are being promised","23:37":"There is nothing but our worldly life, we die and we live, and we will not be resurrected","23:38":"He is but a man who has invented a lie against God, and we will not believe in him","23:39":"He said: \"My Lord, grant me victory for what they denied me","23:40":"He replied: \"In a little while they will be in regret","23:41":"So the scream took them with justice, and We made them as dead plants. So away with the wicked people","23:42":"Then We raised after them different generations","23:43":"No nation can hasten its appointed time, nor can it delay","23:44":"Then We sent Our messengers in succession. Every time there came to a nation their messenger, they denied him. So We made them follow one another, and We made them history. So away with a people who do not believe","23:45":"Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a clear authority","23:46":"To Pharaoh and his leaders. But they became arrogant, for they were a high and mighty people","23:47":"So they said: \"Shall we believe to two humans like us, while their people are servants to us","23:48":"So they denied them, and they became of those who were destroyed","23:49":"And We have given Moses the Scripture, so that they may be guided","23:50":"And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and We gave them refuge on high ground, a place for resting and with a flowing stream","23:51":"O messengers, eat from what is good, and do righteous work. I am aware of what you do","23:52":"And this is your nation, one nation, and I am your Lord so be aware","23:53":"But the affair was disputed between them into segments. Every group happy with what it had","23:54":"So leave them in their error until a time","23:55":"Do they not think why We are extending them with wealth and children","23:56":"We are quick to give them the good things. But they do not perceive","23:57":"As for those who are in reverence from the awareness of their Lord","23:58":"And they believe in the revelations of their Lord","23:59":"And they do not set up anything with their Lord","23:60":"And they give of what they were given, and their hearts are full of reverence that they will return to their Lord","23:61":"These are the ones who race in doing good, and they are the first to it","23:62":"And We do not burden a soul except with what it can bare. And We have a record that speaks with the truth, they will not be wronged","23:63":"No, their hearts are unaware of this! And they have deeds besides this which they are doing","23:64":"Until We take their carefree people with the retribution, then they will shout for help","23:65":"Do not shout for help today, for you will not be helped against Us","23:66":"My revelations were recited to you, but you used to turn back on your heels","23:67":"You were too proud from it, talking evil about it; and you defiantly disregarded it","23:68":"Did they not ponder the words, or has what come to them not come to their fathers of old","23:69":"Or did they not know their messenger For they are in denial of him","23:70":"Or do they say that there is a madness in him No, he has come to them with the truth, but most of them are hateful of the truth","23:71":"And if the truth were to follow their desires, then the heavens and the Earth and all who are in them would have been corrupted. No, We have come to them with their reminder, but from their reminder they are turning away","23:72":"Or do you ask them for a wage The wage of your Lord is best, and He is the best of providers","23:73":"And you are inviting them to a Straight Path","23:74":"And those who do not believe in the Hereafter, they are deviating away from the path","23:75":"And if We were to have mercy on them and remove what distress was upon them, they would still return to persist in their transgression, wandering blindly","23:76":"And when We seized them with the punishment, they did not humble themselves to their Lord nor did they invoke Him","23:77":"Until We open for them a door of immense retribution, then they become in sorrow and despair","23:78":"And He is the One who established for you the hearing, and the sight, and the hearts. Little do you give thanks","23:79":"And He is the One who multiplied you on the Earth, and to Him you will be returned","23:80":"And He is the One who gives life and brings death, and to Him is the alteration of the night and the day. Do you not comprehend","23:81":"No, they have said the same as what the people of old had said","23:82":"They said: \"If we are dead and become dust and bones, will we then be resurrected","23:83":"We, as well as our fathers, have been promised this from before. This is nothing but the tales of the ancients","23:84":"Say: \"To whom is the Earth and whosoever is in it if you know","23:85":"They will Say: \"To God\" Say: \"Will you then not remember","23:86":"Say: \"Who is the Lord of the seven universes and the Lord of the great throne","23:87":"They will Say: \"To God.\" Say: \"Will you then not take heed","23:88":"Say: \"In whose hand is the sovereignty of all things, and He protects while there is no protector against Him, if you know","23:89":"They will Say: \"To God.\" Say: \"Then why are you deceived","23:90":"No, We have come to them with the truth, and they are truly liars","23:91":"God has not taken a son, nor is there with Him any god. If it were so, then every god would have taken what He created and they would have tried to overtake each other.

Glory be to God, He is far above the partners they set up","28:69":"And your Lord knows what is concealed in their chests and what they declare","28:70":"And He is God, there is no god but He. To Him belongs all praise in the first and in the last, and judgment belongs with Him, and to Him you will be returned","28:71":"Say: \"Have you noted: what if God made the night eternal, until the Day of Resurrection Which god, other than God, can bring you with light Do you not listen","28:72":"Say: \"Have you noted: what if God made the daylight eternal, until the Day of Resurrection Which god, other than God, can provide you with a night for your rest Do you not see","28:73":"And from His mercy is that He created for you the night and the day, in order to rest in it, and that you may seek of His provisions. And perhaps you may be appreciative","28:74":"And the Day He will call them and Say: \"Where are My partners whom you had claimed","28:75":"And We will extract from every nation a witness, then We will Say: \"Bring forth your proof.\" They will then realise that all truth belongs with God, and what they had invented will abandon them","28:76":"Qaaroon was from among Moses' people, but he betrayed them.

There is not a nation but a warner came to it","35:25":"And if they deny you, then those before them have also denied. Their messengers went to them with proofs, and the Psalms, and the enlightening Scripture","35:26":"But then I seized those who rejected; how terrible was My retribution","35:27":"Do you not see that God sends down water from the sky, thus We produce with it fruits of various colors And of the mountains are peaks that are white, red, or some other color and intense black","35:28":"And from the people, and the animals, and the livestock, are various colors. As such, only the knowledgeable among God's servants reverence Him. God is Noble, Forgiving","35:29":"Surely, those who recite God's Scripture, and hold the contact-method, and spend secretly and openly from what We have provided them, they are seeking a trade that can never lose","35:30":"He will give them their recompense, and He will increase them from His blessings. He is Forgiving, Appreciative","35:31":"And what We inspired to you from the Scripture, it is the truth, authenticating what is present. God is Expert of His servants, Seer","35:32":"Then We inherited the Scripture to those whom We selected from Our servants. Subsequently, some of them wronged their souls, and others upheld it partly, while others were eager to work righteousness in accordance with God's will; this is the greatest triumph","35:33":"They will enter the gardens of Eden, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments in it will be of silk","35:34":"And they will Say: \"Praise be to God who took away our sorrow. Our Lord is Forgiving, Appreciative","35:35":"The One who admitted us into the abode of eternal bliss, out of His grace. In it, no boredom touches us, nor does any fatigue","35:36":"As for those who have rejected, for them is the fire of Hell, where they do not terminate and die, nor is its retribution ever reduced for them. It is such that We requite every rejecter","35:37":"And they will scream in it: \"Our Lord, let us out, and we will work righteousness instead of the works we used to do.\" Did We not give you a long life so that he who would remember would take heed, and a warner came to you Therefore, taste, for the transgressors will have no supporter","35:38":"God knows unseen of the heavens and the Earth. He is knowledgeable of what is even inside the chests","35:39":"He is the One who made you successors on the Earth. Subsequently, whoever disbelieves, then to him is his disbelief. And the disbelief of the disbelievers only increases their Lord's abhorrence towards them. The disbelief of the disbelievers only increases their loss","35:40":"Say: \"Do you see the partners whom you have called on besides God Show me what they have created on Earth. Or do they possess any partnership in the heavens Or have We given them a scripture wherein they are taking knowledge from it Indeed, what the transgressors promise one another is no more than arrogance","35:41":"God is the One who holds the heavens and the Earth, lest they cease to exist. And they would certainly cease to exist if anyone else were to hold them after Him. He is Compassionate, Forgiving","35:42":"And they swore by God in their strongest oaths, that if a warner came to them, they would be the most guided of all nations, but when a warner came to them, it only increased their aversion","35:43":"Arrogance on Earth, and evil scheming. And the evil schemes only backfire on those who scheme them. Were they expecting anything different from the ways used on the people of the past You will not find any change in God's way, and you will not find any bypass to His way","35:44":"Did they not roam the Earth and note how was the consequence for those who were before them And they were even more powerful than they in strength. But nothing can deter God be it in the heavens, or in the Earth. He is Knowledgeable, Omnipotent","35:45":"And if God were to punish the people for what they have earned, He would not leave a single creature standing. But He delays them to a predetermined time. Then, when their time comes, then God is Seer of His servants","36:1":"S","36:2":"And the Quran of wisdom","36:3":"You are one of the messengers","36:4":"Upon a straight path","36:5":"The revelation of the Most Honourable, Most Merciful","36:6":"To warn a people whose fathers were not warned, for they are unaware","36:7":"The retribution has been deserved by most of them, for they do not believe","36:8":"We have placed shackles around their necks, up to their chins, so that they are forced in direction","36:9":"And We have placed a barrier in front of them, and a barrier behind them, thus We shielded them so they cannot see","36:10":"And whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe","36:11":"You can only warn him who follows the reminder, and reverences the Almighty while unseen. Give him good news of forgiveness and a generous reward","36:12":"It is indeed Us who resurrect the dead, and We record what they have done and left behind. And everything We have counted in a clear ledger","36:13":"And cite for them the example of the people of the town, when the messengers came to it","36:14":"Where We sent two to them, but they disbelieved in them, so We supported them with a third one, thus they said: \"We are messengers to you","36:15":"They replied: \"You are but human beings like us, and the Almighty did not send down anything, you are only telling lies","36:16":"They said: \"Our Lord knows that we have been sent to you","36:17":"And we are only required to give a clear delivery","36:18":"They replied: \"We have welcomed you better than you deserve. If you do not cease, we will stone you, and you will receive a painful retribution from us","36:19":"They said: \"Keep your welcome with you, for you have been reminded. Indeed, you are transgressing people","36:20":"And a man came running from the farthest part of the city, saying: \"O my people, follow the messengers","36:21":"Follow those who do not ask you for any wage, and are guided","36:22":"And why should I not serve the One who initiated me, and to Him is your ultimate return","36:23":"Shall I take gods besides Him If the Almighty intends any harm for me, their intercession cannot help me in the least, nor can they save me","36:24":"Then I would be clearly astray","36:25":"I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me","36:26":"It was said: \"Enter Paradise.\" He said \"Oh, how I wish my people only knew","36:27":"Of what my Lord has forgiven me, and made me of the honoured ones","36:28":"And We did not send down upon his people after him soldiers from the sky; for there was no need to send them down","36:29":"For all it took was one scream, whereupon they were stilled","36:30":"What sorrow for the servants. For every time a messenger went to them, they would ridicule him","36:31":"Did they not see how many generations We destroyed before them, do they not go back to them","36:32":"And how every one of them will be summoned before Us","36:33":"And a sign for them is the dead land, We revive it and produce from it seeds from which they eat","36:34":"And We made in it gardens of date palms, and grapes, and We cause springs to gush forth therein","36:35":"So that they may eat from its fruits, and what they manufacture with their own hands. Would they be thankful","36:36":"Praise be to the One who created all pairs from what the Earth sprouts out and from themselves, and from what they do not know","36:37":"And a sign for them is the night, We remove the daylight from it, whereupon they are in darkness","36:38":"And the sun runs to a specific destination, such is the design of the Noble, the Knowledgeable","36:39":"And the moon We have measured it to appear in stages, until it returns to being like an old curved sheath","36:40":"The sun is not required to overtake the moon, nor will the night precede the day; each of them is swimming in its own orbit","36:41":"And a sign for them is that We carried their ancestors on the charged Ship","36:42":"And We created for them of its similarity, to ride in","36:43":"And if We wished, We could drown them, so that their screaming would not be heard, nor could they be saved","36:44":"Except through a mercy from Us, and as an enjoyment for awhile","36:45":"And when they are told: \"Be aware of your present and your past, that you may attain mercy","36:46":"And no matter what sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord, they turn away from it","36:47":"And when they are told: \"Spend from what God has provisioned you.\" Those who reject say to those who believe: \"Shall we feed those whom God could feed, if He so willed You are clearly misguided","36:48":"And they Say: \"When is this promise to come, if you are truthful","36:49":"They will not realize it when one scream overwhelms them, while they dispute","36:50":"They will not even be able to leave a will, nor will they be able to return to their people","36:51":"And the horn will be blown, whereupon they will rise from the graves massing towards their Lord","36:52":"They will Say: \"Woe to us.

servants","37:82":"Then We drowned the others","37:83":"And from among his descendants was Abraham","37:84":"For he came to his Lord with a pure heart","37:85":"When he said to his father and his people: \"What are you worshiping","37:86":"Is it fabricated gods, instead of God, that you want","37:87":"What do you say of the Lord of the worlds","37:88":"Then he looked towards the stars","37:89":"And he said: \"I am ill","37:90":"So they turned away from him and departed","37:91":"He then went to their idols and said: \"Can you not eat","37:92":"What is the matter, you do not speak","37:93":"So he then turned on them, striking with his hand","37:94":"Then they approached him outraged","37:95":"He said: \"Do you worship what you carve","37:96":"While God has created you, and all that you make","37:97":"They said: \"Build for him a structure, and then throw him into its fire","37:98":"So they wanted to harm him, but We made them the losers","37:99":"And he said: \"I am going to my Lord; He will guide me","37:100":"My Lord, grant me from among the righteous","37:101":"So We gave him good news of a compassionate child","37:102":"And when he grew enough to work with him, he said: \"My son, I am seeing in a dream that I am sacrificing you. What do you think\" He said: \"O my father, do what you are commanded to do. You will find me, God willing, patient","37:103":"So when they both had surrendered, and he put his forehead down","37:104":"And We called him: \"O Abraham","37:105":"You have believed the vision.\" It was such that We rewarded the righteous","37:106":"Surely, this was an exacting test","37:107":"And We ransomed him with a great animal sacrifice","37:108":"And We kept his history for those who came later","37:109":"Peace be upon Abraham","37:110":"It is thus that We reward the righteous","37:111":"He was of Our believing servants","37:112":"And We gave him the good news of the coming of Isaac, a prophet from among the righteous","37:113":"And We blessed him and Isaac.

And woe to those who set up partners","41:7":"The ones who do not contribute towards betterment, and with regards to the Hereafter, they are disbelievers","41:8":"Surely, those who believe and do good works, they will receive recompense without limit","41:9":"Say: \"You are rejecting the One who created the Earth in two days, and you set up equals with Him. This is Lord of the worlds","41:10":"And He placed in it stabilizers from above it, and He blessed it and established its provisions in four equal days, to satisfy those who ask","41:11":"Then He settled to the heaven, while it was still smoke, and He said to it, and to the Earth: \"Come willingly or unwillingly.\" They said: \"We come willingly","41:12":"Thus, He then made them into seven universes in two days, and He inspired to every universe its affair. And We adorned the lowest universe with lamps, and for protection. Such is the design of the Noble, the Knowledgeable","41:13":"But if they turn away, then Say: \"I have warned you of a destruction like the destruction of 'Aad and Thamud","41:14":"When the messengers came to them, publicly and privately: \"You shall not serve except God.\" They said: \"Had our Lord willed, He would have sent Angels. We are rejecting what you have been sent with","41:15":"As for 'Aad, they turned arrogant on Earth, without any right, and they said: \"Who is mightier than us in strength\" Did they not see that God, who created them, was mightier than they in strength And they were denying Our revelations","41:16":"Consequently, We sent upon them violent wind, for a few miserable day, that We may let them taste the humiliating retribution in this life, and the retribution of the Hereafter is more humiliating; they can never win","41:17":"And as for Thamud, We provided them with guidance, but they preferred blindness over guidance. Consequently, the blast of humiliating retribution annihilated them, because of what they earned","41:18":"And We saved those who believed and were righteous","41:19":"And the Day when the enemies of God will be gathered to the Fire, forcibly","41:20":"When they come to it, their own hearing, eyes, and skins will bear witness to everything they had done","41:21":"And they will say to their skins: \"Why did you bear witness against us\" They will reply: \"God made us speak; He is the One who causes everything to speak. He is the One who created you the first time, and to Him you return","41:22":"And there was no way you could hide from the testimony of your own hearing, or your eyes, or your skins. In fact, you thought that God was unaware of much of what you do","41:23":"And this is the kind of thinking about your Lord that has caused you to fail, and thus you became of the losers","41:24":"If they wait, then the Fire will be their destiny, and if they beg to be excused, they will not be excused","41:25":"And We assigned to them companions who adorned their present and past actions. Thus, the retribution has been deserved by them the same as previous nations of Jinn and humans; all of them were losers","41:26":"And those who rejected said: \"Do not listen to this Quran and talk over it that you may succeed","41:27":"We will let those who have rejected taste a severe retribution. And We will recompense them for the evil that they used to do","41:28":"Such is the recompense for God's enemies; the Fire shall be their eternal abode, as a recompense for their discarding Our revelations","41:29":"And those who have rejected will Say: \"Our Lord, show us those who have misled us from among the Jinn and humans so we can trample them under our feet, and render them the lowliest","41:30":"Surely, those who have said: \"Our Lord is God\", then they did right, the Angels will descend upon them: \"You shall not fear, nor shall you grieve. Rejoice in the good news of Paradise that you have been promised","41:31":"We are your allies in this worldly life and in the Hereafter. In it you will have anything your soul desires, and in it you will have anything you ask for","41:32":"A dwelling, from a Forgiver, Most Merciful","41:33":"And who is better in saying than one who invites to God, and does good works, and says: \"I am one of those who have surrendered","41:34":"Not equal are the good and the bad response. You shall resort to the one which is better. Thus, the one who used to be your enemy, may become your best friend","41:35":"And none can attain this except those who are patient. And none can attain this except those who are extremely fortunate","41:36":"And if the devil misleads you in anything, then you shall seek refuge with God. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable","41:37":"And from among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun, nor the moon; you shall prostrate to God who created them, if it is truly Him you serve","41:38":"So, if they become arrogant, then those who are with your Lord glorify Him night and day, and they never despair","41:39":"And from among His signs is that you see the land still, then, as soon as We send down the water upon it, it shakes and grows. Surely, the One who revived it can revive the dead. He is capable of all things","41:40":"Surely, those who distort Our revelations are not hidden from Us. Is one who is thrown into Hell better, or one who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection Do whatever you wish; He is Seer of everything you do","41:41":"Surely, those who have rejected the Reminder when it came to them; and it is an Honourable Scripture","41:42":"No falsehood could enter it, presently or afterwards; a revelation from a Most Wise, Praiseworthy","41:43":"What is being said to you is the same that was said to the messengers before you. Your Lord has forgiveness, and a painful retribution","41:44":"And had We made it a non-Arabic Quran, they would have said: \"If only its verses were made clear!\" Non-Arabic and Arabic, Say: \"For those who believe, it is a guide and healing. As for those who disbelieve, there is a deafness in their ears, and they are blind to it. These will be called from a place far away","41:45":"And We have given Moses the Scripture, but it was disputed in. And had it not been for your Lord's predetermined decision, they would have been judged immediately. Indeed, they harbour many doubts about it","41:46":"Whoever does good works does so for his own soul, and whoever works evil shall have the same. Your Lord does not wrong the servants","41:47":"To Him belongs the knowledge regarding the Hour. And no fruits emerge from their sheaths, nor does any female conceive or give birth, except by His knowledge. And on the Day He asks them: \"Where are My partners\" They will Say: \"By your leave, none of us will testify to that","41:48":"And they were abandoned by that which they used to call on before, and they realised that there will be no escape","41:49":"The human being does not tire in imploring for good things. But if adversity touches him, he is disheartened, desperate","41:50":"And when We let him taste a mercy from Us after adversity had touched him, he will Say: \"This was by my actions, and I do not think that the Hour will come to pass. And even if I am returned to my Lord, I will find at Him good things for me.\" Surely, We will inform the rejecters of all they had done, and We will let them taste the severe retribution","41:51":"And when We bless the human being, he withdraws and turns away, and when he suffers any adversity, he implores in long prayers","41:52":"Say: \"Do you see if this was from God and then you rejected it Who is further astray than those who are in opposition","41:53":"We will show them Our signs in the horizons, and within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that this is the truth. Is it not enough that your Lord is witness over all things","41:54":"Indeed, they are in doubt about meeting their Lord; but He is encompassing all things","42:1":"M","42:2":"A'. S. Q","42:3":"Similarly, inspiring you and those before you, is God, the Noble, the Wise","42:4":"To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the Earth, and He is the Most High, the Great","42:5":"The heavens would nearly shatter from above them, and the Angels praise the glory of their Lord, and they ask forgiveness for those on Earth. Surely, God is the Forgiver, the Merciful","42:6":"And those who take allies besides Him, God is responsible for them; and you are not a guardian over them","42:7":"And thus We have inspired to you an Arabic Quran, so that you may warn the capital town and all around it, and to warn about the Day of Gathering that is inevitable. A group will be in Paradise, and a group in Hell","42:8":"And had God willed, He could have made them one nation. But He admits whom He wills into His mercy. And the transgressors will have neither an ally, nor helper","42:9":"Or have they taken allies besides Him But God is the ally, and He is the One who resurrects the dead, and He is able to do all things","42:10":"And anything you dispute in, then its judgment shall be with God. Such is God my Lord. In Him I put my trust, and to Him I repent","42:11":"Initiator of the heavens and the Earth. He created for you from among yourselves mates, and also mates for the livestock so they may multiply. There is nothing like unto Him. He is the Hearer, the Seer","42:12":"To Him belongs the possessions of the heavens and the Earth. He spreads out the provision for whomever He wills, and He measures it. He is fully aware of all things","42:13":"He has decreed for you the same system He ordained for Noah, and what We inspired to you, and what We ordained for Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: \"You shall uphold this system, and do not divide in it.\" Intolerable for those who have set up partners is what you invite them towards. God chooses to Himself whomever He wills; He guides to Himself those who repent","42:14":"And they only divided after the knowledge had come to them, due to resentment among themselves. And had it not been for a predetermined decision from your Lord, they would have been judged immediately. Indeed, those who inherited the Scripture after them are full of doubts","42:15":"For that, you shall preach and be upright, as you have been commanded, and do not follow their wishes. And Say: \"I believe in all that God has sent down from Scripture, and I was commanded to be with justice between you. God is our Lord and your Lord. We have our deeds and you have your deeds. There is no argument between us and you. God will gather us all together, and to Him is the ultimate destiny","42:16":"And those who debate about God, after they had been answered, their argument is nullified at their Lord. They have incurred a wrath, and will have a severe retribution","42:17":"God is the One who sent down the Scripture with truth, and the balance. And for all that you know, the Hour may be very near","42:18":"Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it, while those who believe are concerned about it, and they know that it is the truth. Certainly, those who dispute the Hour have gone far astray","42:19":"God is Gracious to His servants; He gives provisions for whomever He wills, and He is the Powerful, the Noble","42:20":"Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter, We will increase for him his harvest. And whoever seeks the harvest of this world, We will give him therefrom, and he will have no share in the Hereafter","42:21":"Or do they have partners who decree for them a system which has not been authorized by God And if it were not for the word already given, they would have been judged immediately. Indeed, the transgressors will have a painful retribution","42:22":"You see the transgressors worried because of what they had done; and it will come back at them. As for those who believed and do good works, they will be in the paradises of bliss. They will have what they wish from their Lord. This is the great blessing","42:23":"Such is the good news from God to His servants who believe and do good works. Say: \"I do not ask you for any wage, except that you show compassion to your relatives.\" And whosoever earns a good deed, We shall increase it for him in goodness. Surely, God is Forgiving, Appreciative","42:24":"Or do they Say: \"He has fabricated lies about God!\" If God willed, He could have sealed your heart. And God erases the falsehood and affirms the truth with His words. He is fully aware of what is inside the chests","42:25":"And He is the One who accepts the repentance from His servants, and He forgives the sins. He is fully aware of what you do","42:26":"And those that believe and do good works respond to Him, and He increases for them His blessings. As for the rejecters, they have incurred a severe retribution","42:27":"And if God were to increase the provision for His servants, they would transgress on Earth; but He sends down what He wills in a measure. He is Expert and Seer of His servants","42:28":"And He is the One who sends down the rain after they had despaired, and spreads His mercy. He is the Supporter, the Praiseworthy","42:29":"And from among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the Earth, and the creatures He spreads in them. And He is able to gather them, if He wills","42:30":"And any misfortune that happens to you is a consequence of what your hands have earned. And He overlooks much","42:31":"And you can never escape, and you have none besides God as an ally or helper","42:32":"And from His signs are the vessels that sail the sea like flags","42:33":"If He willed, He could still the winds, leaving them motionless on top of it. In that are signs for every one who is patient, thankful","42:34":"Or He may drown them, for what they have earned. And He overlooks much","42:35":"And those who dispute in Our signs may know that they have no place to hide","42:36":"So whatever you are given is simply an enjoyment of the worldly life, and what is with God is far better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord","42:37":"And those who avoid gross sins and lewdness, and when they are angered, they forgive","42:38":"And those who have responded to their Lord, and they hold the contact-method, and their affairs are conducted by mutual consultation among themselves, and from Our provisions to them they give","42:39":"And those who, when gross injustice befalls them, they seek justice","42:40":"The recompense for a crime shall be its equivalence, but whoever forgives and makes right, then his reward is upon God. He does not like the wrongdoers","42:41":"And for any who demand action after being wronged, those are not committing any error","42:42":"The error is upon those who oppress the people, and they aggress in the land without cause. For these will be a painful retribution","42:43":"And for he who is patient and forgives, then that is an indication of strength","42:44":"And whomever God sends astray will not have any ally after Him. And you will see the transgressors, when they see the retribution, saying: \"Is there any way we can go back","42:45":"And you will see them being displayed to it, in fearful humiliation, and looking, while trying to avoid looking. And those who believed will Say: \"The losers are those who lost their souls and their families on the Day of Resurrection. The transgressors will be in a lasting retribution","42:46":"And they had no allies to help them against God. And whomever God misguides will never find the way","42:47":"Respond to your Lord before a Day comes from God which cannot be averted. You will have no refuge for you on that Day, nor an advocate","42:48":"But if they turn away, then We did not send you as their guardian. You are only required to deliver. And when We let the human being taste mercy from Us, he becomes happy with it, and when adversity afflicts them because of what their hands have done, the human being becomes rejecting","42:49":"To God is the sovereignty of the heavens and the Earth. He creates whatever He wills. He bestows daughters to whomever He wills, and bestows sons to whomever He wills","42:50":"Or, He may bestow them with both daughters and sons, and He makes whom He wills sterile. He is Knowledgeable, Capable","42:51":"And it is not for any human being that God would speak to him, except through inspiration, or from behind a barrier, or by sending a messenger to inspire whom He wills by His leave. He is the Most High, Most Wise","42:52":"And thus, We inspired to you a revelation of Our command. You did not know what was the Scripture, nor what was faith. Yet, We made this a light to guide whomever We wish from among Our servants. Surely, you guide to a straight path","42:53":"The path of God, to whom belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the Earth. Ultimately, all matters revert to God","43:1":"M","43:2":"And the evident Scripture","43:3":"We have made it into an Arabic Quran, perhaps you may understand","43:4":"And it is held honourable and wise in the master record with Us","43:5":"Shall We take away the reminder from you, because you are a transgressing people","43:6":"And how many a prophet did We send to the previous generations","43:7":"And every time a prophet went to them, they ridiculed him","43:8":"We have destroyed those who were even more powerful than these, and the example of the previous generations has already been given","43:9":"And if you asked them: \"Who created the heavens and the Earth\" They will Say: \"They were created by the One who is the Noble, the Knowledgeable","43:10":"He is the One who made the Earth a habitat for you, and He made pathways in it that you may be guided","43:11":"And He is the One who sends down water from the sky, in exact measure. We then revive with it a dead land. Similarly, you will be brought-out","43:12":"And He is the One who created all the pairs, and He made for you from the ships and the livestock that which you can ride","43:13":"So that you may settle on their backs; and then when you have settled on them you may recall your Lord's blessing, by saying: \"Glory be to the One who commits this for us, and we could not have done so by ourselves","43:14":"And we will ultimately return to our Lord","43:15":"And they assigned a share to Him from His own servants!

Have they witnessed their creation We will record their testimony, and they will be asked","43:20":"And they said: \"If the Almighty willed, we would not have worshipped them.\" They have no knowledge of this; they only conjecture","43:21":"Or have We given them a scripture before this which they are upholding","43:22":"The fact is, they have said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way, and we are following in their footsteps","43:23":"And similarly, We did not send a warner to a town, except its carefree ones said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way, and we are being guided in their footsteps","43:24":"He said: \"What if I brought to you better guidance than what you found your fathers upon\" They said: \"We are disbelievers in that with which you have been sent","43:25":"Consequently, We took revenge upon them.

The mercy from your Lord is far better than that which they amass","43:33":"And if it were not that all the people would become one cluster, We would have provided for those who reject the Almighty silver roofs for their homes, and stairs upon which they could ascend","43:34":"And for their homes, gates, and furnishings on which they could recline","43:35":"And many ornaments. All these are the pleasures of this worldly life.

He is fully aware of what you say. He suffices as a witness between me and you. He is the Forgiver, the Merciful","46:9":"Say: \"I am no different from the other messengers, nor do I know what will happen to me or to you. I only follow what is inspired to me. I am no more than a clear warner","46:10":"Say: \"Do you see that if it were from God, and you rejected it, and a witness from the Children of Israel testified to its similarity, and he has believed, while you have turned arrogant Surely, God does not guide the wicked people","46:11":"And those who had rejected said regarding those who had believed: \"If it were any good, they would not have beaten us to it.\" And when they are not able to be guided by it, they will Say: \"This is an old fabrication","46:12":"And before this was the Scripture of Moses, as a role model and a mercy. And this is an authenticating Scripture, in an Arabic tongue, to warn those who transgressed, and to give good news to the righteous","46:13":"Surely, those who said: \"Our Lord is God,\" then they lead a righteous life, there is no fear for them, nor will they grieve","46:14":"These are the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein, a reward for what they used to do","46:15":"And We enjoined the human being to honour his parents. His mother bore him with hardship, gave birth to him in hardship, and his weaning lasts thirty months.

Consequently, today you will be recompensed with a shameful retribution for your arrogance in the land without any right, and for your evil works","46:21":"And recall that the brother of `Aad warned his people at the dunes, while numerous warnings were also delivered before him and with him: \"You shall not serve except God. For I fear for you the retribution of a great day","46:22":"They said: \"Have you come to us to divert us away from our gods Then bring us what you are promising us, if you are truthful","46:23":"He said: \"The knowledge of it is with God; and I only convey to you what I was sent with.

Thus they became such that nothing could be seen except their homes. We thus requite the criminal people","46:26":"And We had established them in the same way as We established you, and provided them with the hearing, and the eyesight, and the heart. But their hearing, eyesight, and hearts did not help them at all. This is because they used to disregard God's revelations, and they were stricken by that which they used to mock","46:27":"And We have destroyed the towns around you, after We had explained the proofs, perhaps they would repent","46:28":"Why then did the idols they set up to bring them closer to God fail to help them Instead, they abandoned them.

God thus cites for the people their examples","47:4":"So, if you encounter those who have rejected, then strike their formations until you overcome them, then bind them securely. You may either set them free or ransom them, until the war ends. And had God willed, He alone could have beaten them, but He thus tests you by one another.
