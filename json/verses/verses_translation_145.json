Work in accordance with your ability; I, too, am working. Soon you shall know whose end is the Abode. Surely the wrongdoers will not prosper.”","6:136":"And they dedicate to God a share of the crops and cattle He created, saying, “This belongs to God”—or so they claim—“and this belongs to our partners.” But that which is for their partners does not reach God, and that which is for God does reach their partners. Evil indeed is the judgment they make","6:137":"Likewise have their partners made the slaying of their children seem fair unto many of the idolaters, that they may ruin them and confound them in their religion. Had God willed, they would not have done so. So leave them and that which they fabricate","6:138":"And they say, “These cattle and crops are sacrosanct; none shall eat of them save whom we will”—or so they claim—and [there are] cattle whose backs are forbidden, and cattle over which they do not invoke the Name of God, fabricating against Him. Soon will He recompense them for that which they used to fabricate","6:139":"And they say, “That which is in the bellies of these cattle is reserved for our males, and forbidden to our wives, but if it be stillborn, then all shall have a share therein.” Soon will He recompense them for that which they ascribe.

We, too, are waiting.”","6:159":"Truly those who have divided their religion and become factions, thou hast nothing to do with them. Their matter rests with God alone; then He will inform them about that which they used to do","6:160":"Whosoever brings a good deed shall have ten times the like thereof; but whosoever brings an evil deed shall be recompensed only with the like thereof, and they shall not be wronged","6:161":"Say, “Truly my Lord has guided me unto a straight path, an upright religion, the creed of Abraham, a ?anif, and he was not of the idolaters.”","6:162":"Say, “Truly my prayer and my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for God, Lord of the worlds","6:163":"He has no partner.

Little do you give thanks","7:11":"Indeed, We created you, then We formed you, then We said unto the angels, “Prostrate yourselves before Adam.” And they all prostrated, save Iblis; he was not among those who prostrated","7:12":"He said, “What prevented thee from prostrating when I commanded thee?” He said, “I am better than him.

There is no error in me, but rather I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds","7:62":"I deliver unto you the messages of my Lord, and advise you sincerely, and I know from God what you know not","7:63":"Or do you marvel that a reminder from your Lord should come unto you by means of a man from among yourselves, so as to warn you, that you might be reverent, and that haply you may receive mercy?”","7:64":"Yet they denied him. So We saved him and those who were with him in the Ark, and We drowned those who denied Our signs. Truly they were a blind people","7:65":"And unto ?Ad, their brother, Hud. He said, “O my people! Worship God! You have no god other than Him. Will you not be reverent?”","7:66":"The notables among his people who disbelieved said, “Truly we think that you are foolish, and we consider you to be among the liars.”","7:67":"He said, “O my people! There is no foolishness in me, but rather I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds","7:68":"I deliver unto you the messages of my Lord, and truly I am a trustworthy adviser unto you","7:69":"Or do you marvel that a reminder from your Lord should come to you by means of a man from among yourselves, so as to warn you?

And that is the recompense of the disbelievers","9:27":"Then thereafter God will relent unto whomsoever He will. And God is Forgiving, Merciful","9:28":"O you who believe! The idolaters are surely unclean; so let them not come near the Sacred Mosque after this year of theirs. If you fear poverty, God will enrich you from His Bounty if He will. Truly God is Knowing, Wise","9:29":"Fight those who believe not in God and in the Last Day, and who do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden, and who follow not the Religion of Truth among those who were given the Book, till they pay the jizyah with a willing hand, being humbled","9:30":"The Jews say that Ezra is the son of God, and the Christians say that the Messiah is the son of God. Those are words from their mouths. They resemble the words of those who disbelieved before. God curse them! How they are perverted","9:31":"They have taken their rabbis and monks as lords apart from God, as well as the Messiah, son of Mary, though they were only commanded to worship one God. There is no god but He! Glory be to Him above the partners they ascribe","9:32":"They desire to extinguish the Light of God with their mouths. But God refuses to do aught but complete His Light, though the disbelievers be averse","9:33":"He it is Who sent His Messenger with guidance and the Religion of Truth to make it prevail over all religion, though the idolaters be averse","9:34":"O you who believe! Verily many of the rabbis and monks consume the wealth of people falsely, and turn from the way of God.

Of them four are sacred. That is the upright religion. So wrong not yourselves during them. And fight the idolaters all together, just as they fight you all together. And know that God is with the reverent","9:37":"Truly the nasi? is but an increase in disbelief, whereby the disbelievers go astray. They make it lawful one year and forbid it another, in order to reconcile it with the number made sacred by God, thus making lawful that which God has forbidden. The evil of their deeds is made to seem fair unto them, but God guides not the disbelieving people","9:38":"O you who believe! What ails you, that when it is said unto you, “Go forth in the way of God,” you sink down heavily to the earth? Are you content with the life of this world over the Hereafter? Yet the enjoyment of the life of this world, compared with the Hereafter, is but a little","9:39":"If you go not forth, He will punish you with a painful punishment, and will place another people in your stead, and you will not harm Him in the least. And God is Powerful over all things","9:40":"If you help him not, yet God has already helped him. Remember when those who disbelieved expelled him, the second of the two. Yea, the two were in the cave, when he said to his companion, “Grieve not; truly God is with us.” Then God sent down His Tranquility upon him, and supported him with hosts you see not. And He made the word of those who disbelieve to be the lowliest, and the Word of God is the highest. And God is Mighty, Wise","9:41":"Go forth in the way of God, lightly or heavily, and strive with your wealth and yourselves in the way of God. That is better for you, if you but knew","9:42":"Were it something ephemeral nearby or an easy journey, they would have followed thee. But the trek was too great for them.

Why didst thou grant them leave before it became clear to thee who spoke the truth and who the liars were","9:44":"Those who believe in God and the Last Day ask of thee no leave from striving with their wealth and their selves. And God knows the reverent","9:45":"Only they ask leave of thee who believe not in God and the Last Day, whose hearts are in doubt, and so they waver in their doubt","9:46":"And had they desired to go forth, they would have made some preparations for it. But God was averse to their being sent forth; so He held them back, and it was said unto them, “Stay back with those who stay back.”","9:47":"And had they gone forth with thee, it would have increased thee in naught but troubles. And they would have hurried about in your midst, seeking to incite discord among you. And among you are some who hearken to them. And God knows the wrongdoers","9:48":"And indeed they sought to incite trials earlier, and turned thee over in their minds, until the truth came and the Command of God was manifest, though they were averse","9:49":"And among them some say, “Grant me leave, and tempt me not.” Nay, they have fallen into temptation. And truly Hell encompasses the disbelievers","9:50":"If some good befalls thee, it troubles them. But if some affliction befalls thee, they say, “We already took precautions beforehand,” and they turn away, exulting","9:51":"Say, “Naught befalls us, save that which God has decreed for us. He is our Master, and in God let the believers trust.”","9:52":"Say, “Do you anticipate that aught will befall us save one of the two best things? But we anticipate for you that God will afflict you with a punishment from Him, or by our hands. So wait! Truly we are waiting along with you.”","9:53":"Say, “Spend willingly or unwillingly; it shall never be accepted from you. Truly you are an iniquitous people.”","9:54":"And naught prevented their spending from being accepted from them, save that they disbelieved in God and in His Messenger, and only come to the prayer lazily, and only spend reluctantly","9:55":"And let not their wealth or their children impress thee. God desires but to punish them thereby in the life of this world, and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers","9:56":"And they swear by God that truly they are of you, but they are not of you. Rather, they are a fearful people","9:57":"Were they to find a refuge, or caves, or a place to enter, they would turn toward it defiantly","9:58":"And among them some reproach thee over the charitable offerings; if they are given thereof, they are content, but if they are not given thereof, behold, they are angry","9:59":"If only they had been content with what God and His Messenger gave them, and said, “God suffices us. God will give unto us from His Bounty, as will the Messenger. Truly our desire is for God.”","9:60":"The charitable offerings are only for the poor, and the indigent, and those working with them, and those whose hearts are [to be] reconciled, and for [ransoming] slaves and for debtors, and in the way of God, and for the traveler: a duty from God.

He believes in God and he has faith in the believers, and he is a mercy to those among you who believe.” And [as for] those who torment the Messenger of God, theirs shall be a painful punishment","9:62":"They swear by God to you, to please you. But God and His Messenger are worthier of being pleased by them, if they are believers","9:63":"Do they know not that whosoever opposes God and His Messenger, surely for him shall be the Fire of Hell, to abide therein? That is the great disgrace","9:64":"The hypocrites dread lest a surah be sent down against them, informing them of that which is in their hearts. Say, “Go on mocking. Truly God will bring forth what you dread.”","9:65":"And if thou askest them, they will surely say, “We were only engaging [in vain talk] and playing.” Say, “Is it God, His signs, and His Messenger you were mocking?”","9:66":"Make no excuses. You disbelieved after having believed. If We pardon a group of you, We shall punish another group for having been guilty","9:67":"The hypocrites, men and women, are like unto one another, enjoining wrong, forbidding right, clutching their hands shut. They forgot God; so He forgot them. Truly the hypocrites are iniquitous","9:68":"Verily God has promised the hypocrites, men and women, and the disbelievers the Fire of Hell, to abide therein. It shall suffice them. God curses them, and theirs shall be a lasting punishment","9:69":"[Remember] those who were before you. They were mightier than you in power, and greater in wealth and children. So they enjoyed their share, and you enjoyed your share, just as those before you enjoyed their share. And you have engaged [in vain talk] as they engaged [in vain talk]. It is they whose deeds came to naught in this world and in the Hereafter, and it is they who are the losers","9:70":"Has not the account come to them of those who were before them, the people of Noah, ?Ad, and Thamud, and the people of Abraham, the inhabitants of Midian, and the overthrown cities? Their messengers brought them clear proofs. God wronged them not, but themselves did they wrong","9:71":"But the believing men and believing women are protectors of one another, enjoining right and forbidding wrong, performing the prayer, giving the alms, and obeying God and His Messenger. They are those upon whom God will have Mercy.

But Contentment from God is greater; that is the great triumph! s","9:73":"Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be harsh with them. Their refuge is Hell. What an evil journey’s end","9:74":"They swear by God that they said it not, but indeed they spoke the word of disbelief, and disbelieved after having submitted [to God]. And they had ambitions that they did not achieve, and they were vengeful only because God and His Messenger enriched them from His Bounty. If they repent, it would be better for them. But if they turn away, God will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and in the Hereafter, and on earth they shall have neither protector nor helper","9:75":"And among them are those who make a pact with God [saying], “If He gives unto us from His Bounty, we will surely spend in charity, and we will surely be among the righteous.”","9:76":"But when He gave unto them from His Bounty, they were miserly with it, and turned away in rejection","9:77":"So He requited them with hypocrisy in their hearts, till the Day they will meet Him, for having failed in that which they promised Him and for having lied","9:78":"Know they not that God knows their secret and their private discourse, and that God is Knower of things unseen","9:79":"As for they who reproach those believers who give freely and those who have naught but their keep [to give], and ridicule them—God ridicules them, and theirs shall be a painful punishment","9:80":"Seek forgiveness for them, or seek not forgiveness for them. If thou seekest forgiveness for them seventy times, God will not forgive them. That is because they disbelieve in God and His Messenger. And God guides not iniquitous people","9:81":"Those who were left behind exulted in staying back, opposing the Messenger of God, and were averse to striving with their wealth and with their selves in the way of God. And they said, “Go not forth in the heat.” Say, “The Fire of Hell is of a heat more intense,” if they but understood","9:82":"So let them laugh little and weep much, as a recompense for that which they used to earn","9:83":"And if God returns thee to a group of them, and they seek leave of thee to go forth, say, “You shall not go forth with me ever; nor shall you fight with me against any enemy. You were content to stay back the first time; so stay back with those who remain behind.”","9:84":"And never pray over one of them who dies, nor stand by his grave. Truly they disbelieved in God and His Messenger and died iniquitous","9:85":"And let not their wealth or their children impress thee. God desires only to punish them thereby in this world, and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers","9:86":"And when a surah is sent down [saying], “Believe in God and strive with His Messenger,” the affluent among them ask thee for leave, and say, “Let us be among those who stay back.”","9:87":"They are content to be among those who remain behind, and a seal is set upon their hearts.

I saw them prostrating before me.”","12:5":"He said, “O my son! Recount not thy vision to thy brothers, lest they devise some scheme against thee. Surely Satan is a manifest enemy unto man","12:6":"Thus shall thy Lord choose thee, and teach thee the interpretation of events, and complete His Blessing upon thee, and upon the House of Jacob, just as He completed it upon thy forefathers, Abraham and Isaac. Truly thy Lord is Knowing, Wise.”","12:7":"Certainly in Joseph and his brothers there are signs for the inquiring","12:8":"[Remember] when they said, “Truly Joseph and his brother are more beloved unto our father than are we, though we are a group. Surely our father is in manifest error","12:9":"Slay Joseph, or cast him out to some land, that your father’s concern might be for you. And be, thereafter, a righteous people.”","12:10":"One among them said, “Slay not Joseph, but cast him into the depths of the well, that some caravan might pick him up, if you would take some action.”","12:11":"They said, “O father! What ails thee that thou dost not trust us with Joseph? Truly we wish him well","12:12":"Send him forth with us tomorrow, to frolic and play. We shall surely be his keepers.”","12:13":"He said, “Truly it grieves me that you should go with him. And I fear that the wolf may eat him, while you are heedless of him.”","12:14":"They said, “If the wolf should eat him, while we are a group, then we would surely be losers!”","12:15":"So when they went with him, and agreed to put him in the depths of the well, We revealed unto him, “Verily thou wilt inform them of this affair of theirs, when they are unaware.”","12:16":"And in the evening they came weeping unto their father","12:17":"They said, “O father! We went racing with one another, and left Joseph with our things, and the wolf ate him. But thou wouldst not believe us, even if we were truthful.”","12:18":"And they brought forth his shirt with false blood. He said, “Nay, your souls have seduced you in this matter. Beautiful patience! And God is the One Whose help is sought against that which you describe.”","12:19":"And then a caravan came along and sent their water carrier, and he let down his bucket. He said, “Good news! Here is a boy!” So they hid him as merchandise. And God knew well what they were doing","12:20":"And they sold him for a low price, a number of dirhams, for they valued him not","12:21":"The man from Egypt who bought him said unto his wife, “Give him honorable accommodation. It may be that he will bring us some benefit, or that we may take him as a son.” And thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that We might teach him the interpretation of events. And God prevails over His affair, but most of mankind know not","12:22":"When he reached his maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus do We recompense the virtuous","12:23":"But she in whose house he was staying sought to lure him from himself. She locked the doors and said, “Come, thou!” He said, “God be my refuge! Truly He is my lord, and has made beautiful my accommodation. Verily the wrongdoers will not prosper!”","12:24":"She indeed inclined toward him, and he would have inclined toward her, had he not seen the proof of his Lord. Thus it was, that We might turn him away from evil and indecency. Truly he was among Our sincere servants","12:25":"And they raced to the door, while she tore his shirt from behind. And they encountered her master at the door. She said, “What is the recompense for one who desires ill toward thy wife, save that he be imprisoned, or a painful punishment?”","12:26":"He said, “It was she who sought to lure me from myself.” And a witness from her own people testified, “If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has spoken the truth and he is among the liars","12:27":"But if his shirt is torn from behind, then she has lied and he is among the truthful.”","12:28":"So when he saw that his shirt was torn from behind, he said, “Verily this is among the schemes of you women—your scheming is great indeed","12:29":"Joseph, turn away from this. And you, seek forgiveness for your sin. Truly you were among those at fault.”","12:30":"Some women of the city said, “The viceroy’s wife sought to lure her slave boy from himself! He has filled her with ardent love. Truly we consider her to be in manifest error.”","12:31":"So when she heard of their plotting, she sent for them, and prepared a repast for them, and gave each of them a knife. And she said [to Joseph], “Come out before them!” Then when they saw him, they so admired him that they cut their hands and said, “God be praised! This is no human being. This is naught but a noble angel!”","12:32":"She said, “This is the one on whose account you blamed me. I indeed sought to lure him from himself, but he remained chaste. And if he does not do as I command, he shall surely be imprisoned; and he shall be among those humbled.”","12:33":"He said, “My Lord! Prison is dearer to me than that to which they call me. If Thou dost not turn their scheming away from me, I shall incline toward them and be among the ignorant.”","12:34":"So his Lord answered him, and turned their scheming away from him. Truly He is the Hearing, the Knowing","12:35":"Then it occurred to them, after they had seen the signs, that they should imprison him for a time","12:36":"Now two young men entered the prison with him. One of them said, “Truly I see myself [in a dream] pressing wine.” The other said, “Truly I see myself [in a dream] carrying bread atop my head, from which the birds eat.” “Inform us of its interpretation. Truly we see you as being among the virtuous.”","12:37":"He said, “No food with which you are provided will come unto you, save that I shall inform you of its interpretation before it comes. This is among the things my Lord has taught me. I forsake the creed of a people who believe not in God, and they who are disbelievers in the Hereafter","12:38":"And I follow the creed of my fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. It is not for us to ascribe any partners unto God. That is from the bounty God has bestowed upon us and upon mankind, but most of mankind do not give thanks","12:39":"O my fellow prisoners! Are diverse lords better, or God, the One, the Paramount","12:40":"You worship apart from Him naught but names that you have named—you and your fathers—for which God has sent down no authority. Judgment belongs to God alone. He commands that you worship none but Him. That is the upright religion, but most of mankind know not. A","12:41":"my fellow prisoners! As for one of you, he shall serve wine to his lord. But as for the other, he shall be crucified, and the birds will eat from his head. The matter about which you inquired has been decreed.”","12:42":"And he said to the one of them whom he knew would be saved, “Mention me to your lord.” But Satan caused him to forget to make mention to his lord. So he remained in prison for several years","12:43":"And the king said, “Verily I see [in a dream] seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean ones; and seven green heads of grain, and others dry","12:44":"notables! Give me your opinion on my vision, if you can interpret visions.”","12:45":"They said, “What confused dreams! And we are not experts in the interpretation of dreams!”","12:46":"Now the one who had been saved among the two said, remembering after a while, “I shall inform you of its interpretation, so send me forth.”","12:47":"“Joseph, O truthful one! Give us thine opinion concerning seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean ones, and seven green heads of grain, and others dry, that haply I may return to the people, that they might know.”","12:48":"He said, “You will sow diligently for seven years. Then whatever you harvest, leave in its ear, save a little that you eat","12:49":"Then after this will come seven hard [years] which will devour that which you have saved in advance for them, save a little of that which you have stored","12:50":"Then after this will come a year wherein people will be granted succor, and wherein they will press [wine and oil].”","12:51":"The king said, “Bring him to me!” So when the messenger came to him he said, “Return to your lord and ask him, ‘What of the women who cut their hands? Surely my Lord knows well their scheming!’”","12:52":"He said, “What was your purpose when you sought to lure Joseph from himself?” They said, “God be praised! We know no evil against him.” The viceroy’s wife said, “Now the truth has come to light. It was I who sought to lure him from himself, and verily he is among the truthful.”","12:53":"“This is so, that he may know that I betrayed him not in his absence. Truly God guides not the scheming of the treacherous","12:54":"But I absolve not my own soul. Surely the soul commands to evil, save whom my Lord may show mercy. Truly my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.”","12:55":"And the king said, “Bring him to me, that I might reserve him exclusively for myself.” Then when he had spoken with him, he said, “Truly this day thou shalt be of high rank and trusted in our presence.”","12:56":"He said, “Set me over the storehouses of the land. Truly I am a skilled keeper.”","12:57":"Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that there he might settle wheresoever he will. We cause Our Mercy to fall upon whomsoever We will, and We neglect not the reward of the virtuous","12:58":"And the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and are reverent","12:59":"The brothers of Joseph came and entered upon him, and he recognized them, while they knew him not","12:60":"And when he had arranged for their provisions, he said, “Bring me a brother of yours from your father. Do you not see that I give full measure, and that I am the best of hosts","12:61":"But if you bring him not unto me, you shall have no measure from me, nor shall you come nigh unto me.” a They said, “We shall seek to lure him from his father; that we shall surely do.”","12:62":"He said to his servant boys, “Put their merchandise in their saddlebags. Perchance they will recognize it when they have gone back to their people; perchance they will return.”","12:63":"So when they returned to their father, they said, “O father! The measure has been withheld from us. So send our brother with us that we might obtain the measure. We shall surely be his keepers.”","12:64":"He said, “Should I entrust him to you as I entrusted his brother to you aforetime? But God is the best of keepers, and He is the most Merciful of the merciful.”","12:65":"And when they opened their belongings, they found their merchandise had been returned to them. They said, “O father! What [more] do we seek? This is our merchandise returned unto us! Now we can provide for our family, and keep watch over our brother, while getting another camel-load—these are meager rations!”","12:66":"He said, “I will not send him forth with you till you give me a solemn pledge before God that you will surely bring him back to me, unless you are surrounded.” So when they gave their solemn pledge, he said, “God is Guardian over what we say.”","12:67":"And he said, “O my sons! Enter not by one gate, but enter by separate gates. Yet, I cannot avail you aught against God. Judgment belongs to God alone. I trust in Him; and let those who trust, trust in Him.”","12:68":"And when they entered whence their father had commanded them, it did not avail them aught against God, but it fulfilled a need in Jacob’s soul. Truly he was possessed of knowledge because of that which We taught him, but most of mankind know not","12:69":"And when they entered upon Joseph, he drew his brother close to himself and said, “Truly I am your brother; so be not distressed on account of that which they used to do.”","12:70":"And when he had made ready their provisions, he put the drinking cup into his brother’s saddlebag. Then a herald cried out, “O you men of the caravan! Truly you are thieves!”","12:71":"Turning toward them, they said, “What are you missing?”","12:72":"They said, “We are missing the goblet of the king.” “For whosoever brings it forth, there shall be a camel-load. I shall be its guarantor.”","12:73":"They said, “By God, you certainly know that we came not to work corruption in the land, and we are not thieves.”","12:74":"They said, “And what will be the recompense for it if you be liars?”","12:75":"They said, “Its recompense will be that he in whose saddlebag it is found—he himself shall be its recompense. Thus do we recompense the wrongdoers.”","12:76":"Then he began with their baggage, before the baggage of his brother. Then he removed it from his brother’s baggage. Thus did We devise a scheme for Joseph. Under the king’s law, he could not have taken his brother unless God willed. We raise in degrees whomsoever We will, and above every possessor of knowledge is a knower","12:77":"They said, “If he has stolen, a brother of his had stolen aforetime.” But Joseph kept it secret in his soul and disclosed it not unto them. He said, “You are in a worse position! And God knows best concerning that which you describe.”","12:78":"They said, “O viceroy! He has a venerable, aged father; so take one of us in his place. Truly we see you as being among the virtuous.”","12:79":"He said, “God be my refuge that we should take any save the one with whom we found our property! For then we would surely be wrongdoers.”","12:80":"So when they despaired of [swaying] him, they conferred privately. The eldest of them said, “Do you not know that your father has taken a solemn pledge from you before God, and earlier you neglected Joseph? Thus I shall not depart from this land till my father grants me leave, or God renders judgment upon me, and He is the best of judges","12:81":"Return unto your father and say, ‘O father! Verily your son has committed theft. And we bore witness to that which we knew, but we are not keepers of the unseen","12:82":"So ask the town wherein we were, and the caravan with which we approached. Verily we are truthful.’”","12:83":"He said, “Nay, your souls have seduced you in this matter. Beautiful patience! It may be that God will bring them to me all together. Truly He is the Knowing, the Wise.”","12:84":"And he turned away from them and said, “Oh, how great is my grief for Joseph!” His eyes had turned white with grief, and he was choked with anguish","12:85":"They said, “By God, wilt thou go on remembering Joseph till thou art ill to the point of death, or till thou hast perished?”","12:86":"He said, “I complain of my sorrow and grief to God alone. And I know from God that which you know not","12:87":"O my sons! Go and inquire about Joseph and his brother and despair not of God’s Comfort; truly none despairs of God’s Comfort save the disbelieving people.”","12:88":"So when they entered upon him they said, “O viceroy! Affliction has befallen us and our people. We bring but meager merchandise; yet grant us full measure and be charitable unto us. Truly God shall recompense the charitable.”","12:89":"He said, “Do you know what you have done with Joseph and his brother, when you were ignorant?”","12:90":"They said, “Art thou indeed Joseph?” He said, “I am Joseph and this is my brother. God has been gracious unto us. Verily whosoever is reverent and patient—surely God neglects not the reward of the virtuous.”","12:91":"“By God!” they said, “God has preferred thee over us, and we were at fault.”","12:92":"He said, “There is no reproach against you this day. God will forgive you. And He is the most Merciful of the merciful","12:93":"Take this shirt of mine and cast it upon my father’s face; he will come to see. And bring me your family, all together.”","12:94":"And as the caravan set off, their father said, “Truly I sense the scent of Joseph, if you think me not senile!”","12:95":"They said, “By God! Truly thou art astray as of old.”","12:96":"And when the bearer of glad tidings came, he cast it upon his face and he was restored to sight. He said, “Did I not say unto you that I know from God that which you know not?”","12:97":"They said, “O father! Seek forgiveness for us from our sins. Truly we were at fault.”","12:98":"He said, “I shall indeed seek forgiveness for you from my Lord. Truly He is Forgiving, Merciful.”","12:99":"So when they entered upon Joseph, he drew his parents close to himself and said, “Enter Egypt in security, if God wills!”","12:100":"And he raised his parents up to the throne, and they [all] fell prostrate toward him. He said, “O my father! This is the fulfillment of my vision; my Lord has made it come true. He was good to me when He brought me forth from prison, and brought thee from the desert, after Satan incited evil between my brothers and me. Indeed, my Lord is Subtle in that which He wills. Truly He is the Knower, the Wise","12:101":"My Lord! Thou hast given me something of sovereignty, and taught me the interpretation of events. Originator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art my Protector in this world and in the Hereafter! Take me as a submitter unto Thyself, and admit me to the company of the righteous.”","12:102":"These are among the accounts of the unseen which We reveal unto thee. And thou wert not with them when they decided upon their affair and plotted","12:103":"And most of mankind, however much thou mightest desire, are not believers","12:104":"And thou askest of them no reward for it; it is naught but a reminder for the worlds","12:105":"How many a sign is there in the heavens and on the earth by which they pass; yet they turn away from them","12:106":"And most of them believe not in God, save that they ascribe partners unto Him","12:107":"Do they feel secure from the coming of an overwhelming punishment from God upon them? Or from the coming of the Hour suddenly, while they are unaware","12:108":"Say, “This is my way. I call unto God with clear sight—I, and those who follow me. Glory be to God! And I am not among those who ascribe partners unto God.”","12:109":"And We sent none before thee, save men unto whom We sent revelation among the people of the towns. Have they not journeyed upon the earth and observed how those before them fared in the end? And the Abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are reverent. Do you not understand","12:110":"Till, when the messengers despaired and thought that they were deemed liars, Our Help came unto them, and whosoever We willed was saved. And Our Might shall not be turned back from the guilty people","12:111":"Certainly in their stories is a lesson for those possessed of intellect. It is not a fabricated account; rather, it is a confirmation of that which came before it, and an elaboration of all things, and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe","13:1":"Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra. These are the signs of the Book; and that which has been sent down unto thee from thy Lord is the truth, but most of mankind believe not","13:2":"God it is Who raised the heavens without pillars that you see, then mounted the Throne; and He made the sun and the moon subservient, each running for a term appointed. He directs the affair, expounding the signs, so that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord","13:3":"He it is Who spread out the earth and placed therein firm mountains and streams, and of every kind of fruit He placed therein two kinds. He causes the night to cover the day. Truly in that are signs for a people who reflect","13:4":"Upon the earth are neighboring tracts, vineyards, sown fields, and date palms of a shared root and not of a shared root, watered by one water.

How evil an exchange for the wrongdoers","18:51":"I did not make them witnesses to the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor to their own creation. And I take not those who lead astray as a support","18:52":"On the Day when He says, “Call those whom you claimed as My partners,” they will call upon them, but they will not respond to them, and We will place a gulf between them","18:53":"The guilty will see the Fire, and know they shall fall into it, but they will find no means of escape therefrom","18:54":"And indeed We have employed every kind of parable for mankind in this Quran. And man is the most contentious of beings","18:55":"And naught prevents men from believing when guidance comes unto them, and from seeking forgiveness of their Lord, save that [they await] the wont of those of old to come upon them, or the punishment to come upon them face-to-face","18:56":"And We send not the messengers, save as bearers of glad tidings and as warners. And those who disbelieve dispute falsely in order to refute the truth thereby. They take My signs and that whereof they were warned in mockery","18:57":"And who does greater wrong than one who has been reminded of the signs of his Lord, then turns away from them and forgets that which his hands have sent forth? Surely We have placed coverings over their hearts, such that they understand it not, and in their ears a deafness. Even if thou callest them to guidance, they will never be rightly guided","18:58":"And thy Lord is Forgiving, Possessed of Mercy. Were He to take them to task for that which they have earned, He would have hastened the punishment for them. Nay, but theirs is a tryst, beyond which they shall find no refuge","18:59":"And those towns, We destroyed them for the wrong they did, and We set a tryst for their destruction","18:60":"And when Moses said unto his servant, “I shall continue on till I reach the junction of the two seas, even if I journey for a long time.”","18:61":"Then when they reached the junction of the two, they forgot their fish, and it made its way to the sea, burrowing away","18:62":"Then when they had passed beyond, he said to his servant, “Bring us our meal. We have certainly met with weariness on this journey of ours.”","18:63":"He said, “Didst thou see? When we took refuge at the rock, indeed I forgot the fish—and naught made me neglect to mention it, save Satan—and it made its way to the sea in a wondrous manner!”","18:64":"He said, “That is what we were seeking!” So they turned back, retracing their steps","18:65":"There they found a servant from among Our servants whom We had granted a mercy from Us and whom We had taught knowledge from Our Presence","18:66":"Moses said unto him, “Shall I follow thee, that thou mightest teach me some of that which thou hast been taught of sound judgment?”","18:67":"He said, “Truly thou wilt not be able to bear patiently with me","18:68":"And how canst thou bear patiently that which thou dost not encompass in awareness?”","18:69":"He said, “Thou wilt find me patient, if God wills, and I shall not disobey thee in any matter.”","18:70":"He said, “If thou wouldst follow me, then question me not about anything, till I make mention of it to thee.”","18:71":"So they went on till, when they had embarked upon a ship, he made a hole therein.

Thou hast attained sufficient excuse from me.”","18:77":"So they went on till they came upon the people of a town and sought food from them. But they refused to show them any hospitality. Then they found therein a wall that was about to fall down; so he set it up straight. He said, “Hadst thou willed, thou couldst have taken a wage for it.”","18:78":"He said, “This is the parting between thee and me. I shall inform thee of the meaning of that which thou couldst not bear patiently","18:79":"As for the ship, it belonged to indigent people who worked the sea. I desired to damage it, for just beyond them was a king who was seizing every ship by force","18:80":"And as for the young boy, his parents were believers and we feared that he would make them suffer much through rebellion and disbelief","18:81":"So we desired that their Lord give them in exchange one who is better than him in purity, and nearer to mercy","18:82":"And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and beneath it was a treasure belonging to them. Their father was righteous, and thy Lord desired that they should reach their maturity and extract their treasure, as a mercy from thy Lord. And I did not do this upon my own command. This is the meaning of that which thou couldst not bear patiently.”","18:83":"And they question thee about Dhu’l-Qarnayn. Say, “I shall recite unto you a remembrance of him.”","18:84":"Truly We established him in the land, and gave him the means to all things","18:85":"So he followed a means","18:86":"till when he reached the place of the setting sun, he found it setting in a murky spring, and there he found a people. We said, “O Dhu’l-Qarnayn! Thou mayest punish, or thou mayest treat them well.”","18:87":"He said, “As for the one who has done wrong, we shall punish him. Then he shall be brought back to his Lord, whereupon He will punish him with a terrible punishment","18:88":"But as for the one who believes and works righteousness, he shall have a reward, that which is most beautiful, and we shall speak unto him that which is easy from our command.”","18:89":"Then he followed a means","18:90":"till he reached the place of the rising sun. He found it rising over a people for whom We had not made any shelter from it","18:91":"Thus [it was], and We encompassed that which lay before him in awareness","18:92":"Then he followed a means","18:93":"till he reached the place between the two mountain barriers. He found beyond them a people who could scarcely comprehend speech","18:94":"They said, “O Dhu’l-Qarnayn! Truly Gog and Magog are workers of corruption in the land. Shall we assign thee a tribute, that thou mightest set a barrier between them and us?”","18:95":"He said, “That wherewith my Lord has established me is better; so aid me with strength. I shall set a rampart between you and them","18:96":"Bring me pieces of iron.” Then, when he had leveled the two cliffs, he said, “Blow!” till when he had made it fire, he said, “Bring me molten copper to pour over it.”","18:97":"Thus they were not able to surmount it, nor could they pierce it","18:98":"He said, “This is a mercy from my Lord. And when the Promise of my Lord comes, He will crumble it to dust. And the Promise of my Lord is true.”","18:99":"And We shall leave them, on that Day, to surge against one another like waves. And the trumpet shall be blown, and We shall gather them together","18:100":"And We shall present Hell, on that Day, as an array before the disbelievers","18:101":"those whose eyes were veiled from the remembrance of Me, and could not hear","18:102":"Do those who disbelieve reckon that they may take My servants as protectors apart from Me? Truly We have prepared Hell as a welcome for the disbelievers","18:103":"Say, “Shall I inform you who are the greatest losers in respect to their deeds","18:104":"Those whose efforts go astray in the life of this world, while they reckon that they are virtuous in their works.”","18:105":"They are those who disbelieve in the signs of their Lord, and in the meeting with Him. Thus their deeds have come to naught, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall assign them no weight","18:106":"That is their recompense—Hell—for having disbelieved and for having taken My signs and My messengers in mockery","18:107":"Those who believe and perform righteous deeds, theirs shall be the Gardens of Paradise as a welcome","18:108":"Abiding therein, they seek not any change therefrom","18:109":"Say, “If the sea were ink for the Words of my Lord, the sea would be exhausted before the Words of my Lord were exhausted, even if We brought the like thereof to replenish it.”","18:110":"Say, “I am only a human being like you.

Ha. Ya. ?Ayn. ?ad","19:2":"A reminder of the Mercy of thy Lord unto His servant, Zachariah","19:3":"when he cried out to his Lord with a secret cry","19:4":"He said, “My Lord! Verily my bones have grown feeble, and my head glistens with white hair.

So grant me from Thy Presence an heir","19:6":"who will inherit from me and inherit from the House of Jacob. And make him, my Lord, well-pleasing.”","19:7":"“O Zachariah! Truly We bring thee glad tidings of a boy whose name is John; We have not given this as a name to any before him.”","19:8":"He said, “My Lord! How shall I have a boy, when my wife is barren, and I have grown decrepit with old age?”","19:9":"He said, “Thus shall it be. Thy Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me! I had created thee before, when thou wast nothing!’”","19:10":"He said, “My Lord! Appoint for me a sign.” He said, “Thy sign shall be that thou shalt not speak with men for three nights, [while thou art] sound.”","19:11":"So he came forth from the sanctuary unto his people, and signaled to them that they should glorify morning and evening","19:12":"“O John! Take the Book with strength!” And We gave him judgment as a child","19:13":"and a tenderness from Our Presence, and purity; and he was reverent","19:14":"and dutiful toward his parents. He was not domineering, rebellious","19:15":"Peace be upon him the day he was born, and the day he dies, and the day he is raised alive","19:16":"And remember Mary in the Book, when she withdrew from her family to an eastern place","19:17":"And she veiled herself from them. Then We sent unto her Our Spirit, and it assumed for her the likeness of a perfect man","19:18":"She said, “I seek refuge from thee in the Compassionate, if you are reverent!”","19:19":"He said, “I am but a messenger of thy Lord, to bestow upon thee a pure boy.”","19:20":"She said, “How shall I have a boy when no man has touched me, nor have I been unchaste?”","19:21":"He said, “Thus shall it be. Thy Lord says, ‘It is easy for Me.’” And [it is thus] that We might make him a sign unto mankind, and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter decreed","19:22":"So she conceived him and withdrew with him to a place far off","19:23":"And the pangs of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a date palm. She said, “Would that I had died before this and was a thing forgotten, utterly forgotten!”","19:24":"So he called out to her from below her, “Grieve not! Thy Lord has placed a rivulet beneath thee","19:25":"And shake toward thyself the trunk of the date palm; fresh, ripe dates shall fall upon thee","19:26":"So eat and drink and cool thine eye. And if thou seest any human being, say, ‘Verily I have vowed a fast unto the Compassionate, so I shall not speak this day to any man.’”","19:27":"Then she came with him unto her people, carrying him. They said, “O Mary! Thou hast brought an amazing thing","19:28":"O sister of Aaron! Thy father was not an evil man, nor was thy mother unchaste.”","19:29":"Then she pointed to him. They said, “How shall we speak to one who is yet a child in the cradle?”","19:30":"He said, “Truly I am a servant of God. He has given me the Book and made me a prophet","19:31":"He has made me blessed wheresoever I may be, and has enjoined upon me prayer and almsgiving so long as I live","19:32":"and [has made me] dutiful toward my mother. And He has not made me domineering, wretched","19:33":"Peace be upon me the day I was born, the day I die, and the day I am raised alive!”","19:34":"That is Jesus son of Mary—a statement of the truth, which they doubt","19:35":"It is not for God to take a child. Glory be to Him! When He decrees a thing, He only says to it, “Be!” and it is","19:36":"“Truly God is my Lord and your Lord; so worship Him. This is a straight path.”","19:37":"Yet the parties differed among themselves, and woe unto those who disbelieve for the witnessing of a tremendous day","19:38":"How well they will hear and how well they will see on the Day they come unto Us.

Why do you worship that which neither hears nor sees, nor can avail you in any way","19:43":"O my father! Verily knowledge has come unto me that has not come unto you. So follow me, and I shall guide you upon a sound path","19:44":"O my father! Worship not Satan; surely Satan is disobedient toward the Compassionate","19:45":"O my father! Truly I fear that a punishment from the Compassionate will befall you, such that you will become a friend of Satan.”","19:46":"He said, “Do you reject my gods, O Abraham? If you cease not, I shall surely stone you. Take leave of me for a long while!”","19:47":"He said, “Peace be upon you! I shall seek forgiveness for you from my Lord.

And I call upon my Lord; it may be that in calling upon my Lord, I will not be wretched.”","19:49":"So when he had withdrawn from them and that which they called upon apart from God, We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob, and each We made a prophet","19:50":"And We bestowed upon them something of Our Mercy, and ordained for them a sublime, faithful renown","19:51":"And remember Moses in the Book. Verily he was devoted, and he was a messenger, a prophet","19:52":"We called out to him from the right side of the Mount, and drew him nigh in intimate discourse","19:53":"And We bestowed upon him, from Our Mercy, his brother, Aaron, a prophet","19:54":"And remember Ishmael in the Book. Verily he was true to the promise, and he was a messenger, a prophet","19:55":"He used to bid his people to prayer and almsgiving, and he was pleasing unto his Lord","19:56":"And remember Idris in the Book. Verily he was truthful, a prophet","19:57":"And We raised him to a sublime station","19:58":"They are those whom God has blessed among the prophets of the progeny of Adam, and of those whom We carried with Noah, and of the progeny of Abraham and Israel, and of those whom We guided and chose. When the signs of the Compassionate were recited unto them, they would fall down, prostrate and weeping","19:59":"Then they were succeeded by a generation who neglected prayer and followed base desires. So they shall meet [the reward of] error","19:60":"save for those who repent and believe and work righteousness. It is they who shall enter the Garden, and they shall not be wronged in the least","19:61":"Gardens of Eden, those which the Compassionate promised His servants in the Unseen. Verily His Promise shall come to pass","19:62":"They shall hear no idle talk therein, but only “Peace!” And therein they shall have their provision, morning and evening","19:63":"This is the Garden We shall bequeath unto those among Our servants who were reverent","19:64":"“We descend not, save by the Command of thy Lord.

What hindered thee, when thou didst see them going astray","20:93":"that thou didst not follow me? Didst thou disobey my command?”","20:94":"He said, “O son of my mother! Seize not my beard or my head. Truly I feared that thou wouldst say, ‘Thou hast caused division among the Children of Israel, and thou hast not heeded my word.’”","20:95":"He said, “What was your purpose, O Samaritan?”","20:96":"He said, “I saw that which they saw not. So I took a handful [of dust] from the footsteps of the messenger, and I cast it. Thus did my soul prompt me.”","20:97":"He said, “Be gone! In this life it shall be yours to say, ‘Touch [me] not!’ And truly for you there is a tryst that you cannot fail to keep. Now observe your god, to whom you remained devoted: we shall surely burn it and scatter its ashes in the sea!”","20:98":"Your only god is God, besides whom there is no other god. He encompasses all things in knowledge","20:99":"Thus do We narrate unto thee some of the accounts of those who have come before. And We have given thee a Reminder from Our Presence","20:100":"Whosoever turns away from it, verily he shall bear it as a burden on the Day of Resurrection","20:101":"abiding therein. How evil a burden for them on the Day of Resurrection—","20:102":"the Day the trumpet shall be blown, and We shall gather the guilty on that Day, blind","20:103":"They will whisper among themselves, “You have tarried only ten [days].”","20:104":"We know well that which they will say, when the most exemplary of them in conduct will say, “You have tarried only a day!”","20:105":"They ask thee about the mountains. Say, “My Lord shall scatter them as ashes","20:106":"And He will leave it a barren plain","20:107":"You will see no crookedness or curvature therein.”","20:108":"On that Day they shall follow a herald in whom there is no crookedness. And voices will be humbled before the Compassionate, and you will hear naught but a murmur","20:109":"On that Day intercession will be of no benefit, save [that of] those whom the Compassionate has granted leave and with whose word He is content","20:110":"He knows that which is before them and that which is behind them, and they encompass Him not in knowledge","20:111":"Faces will be humbled before the Living, the Self-Subsisting. And whosoever bears wrongdoing will have failed","20:112":"But whosoever performs righteous deeds and is a believer, he shall fear neither wrong nor deprivation","20:113":"Thus have We sent it down as an Arabic Quran, and We have varied the threat therein that haply they may be reverent, or [that] it might occasion remembrance for them","20:114":"Exalted is God, the True Sovereign. Be not in haste with the Quran before its revelation is completed for thee, but say, “My Lord! Increase me in knowledge!”","20:115":"And We indeed made a pact with Adam aforetime, but he forgot. And We found no resoluteness in him","20:116":"And when We said unto the angels, “Prostrate yourselves before Adam,” they prostrated, save Iblis; he refused","20:117":"We said, “O Adam! Truly this is an enemy unto thee and thy wife. So let him not expel the two of you from the Garden, such that thou wouldst be wretched","20:118":"Truly it is for thee that thou shalt neither hunger therein, nor go naked","20:119":"and that thou shalt neither thirst therein, nor suffer from the heat of the sun.”","20:120":"Then Satan whispered to him. He said, “O Adam! Shall I show thee the Tree of Everlastingness and a kingdom that never decays?”","20:121":"So they both ate therefrom. Then their nakedness was exposed to them, and they began to sew together the leaves of the Garden. Adam disobeyed his Lord, and so he erred","20:122":"Then his Lord chose him, and relented unto him and guided [him]","20:123":"He said, “Get down from it, both you together, each of you an enemy to the other. And if guidance should come unto you from Me, then whosoever follows My Guidance shall not go astray, nor be wretched","20:124":"But whosoever turns away from the remembrance of Me, truly his shall be a miserable life, and We shall raise him blind on the Day of Resurrection.”","20:125":"He will say, “My Lord! Why hast Thou raised me blind, when I used to see?”","20:126":"He will say, “Thus it is. Our signs came unto you, but you forgot them. Even so, this Day shall you be forgotten!”","20:127":"Thus do We recompense whosoever is prodigal and believes not in the signs of his Lord. And surely the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more lasting","20:128":"Does it not serve as guidance for them, how many generations We destroyed before them, amid whose dwellings they walk? Truly in that are signs for those possessed of intelligence","20:129":"And were it not for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord and a term appointed, it would be inevitable","20:130":"So bear patiently that which they say, and hymn the praise of thy Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting, and in the hours of the night glorify [Him], and at the ends of the day, that haply thou mayest be content","20:131":"Strain not thine eyes toward the enjoyments We have granted certain classes of them, as the splendor of the life of this world, that We may test them concerning it. The provision of thy Lord is better and more lasting","20:132":"And bid thy family to prayer and be steadfast therein. We ask no provision of thee; We provide for thee. And the end belongs to reverence","20:133":"They say, “Why has he not brought us a sign from his Lord?” Has there not come unto them the clear proof of that which is in the scriptures of old","20:134":"Had We destroyed them with a punishment before it, they would have said, “Our Lord! If only Thou hadst sent a messenger unto us, we would have followed Thy signs before being abased and disgraced.”","20:135":"Say, “Each is waiting, so wait! For you shall come to know those who are the companions of the sound path, and those who are rightly guided.”","21:1":"For mankind, their reckoning draws nigh, while they turn away heedless","21:2":"No new Reminder came unto them from their Lord, but that they listened to it while they played","21:3":"with their hearts diverted. And those who do wrong confide in secret converse, “Is this not but a human being like yourselves? Will you then yield to sorcery, while you see clearly?”","21:4":"He said, “My Lord knows that which is spoken in Heaven and on earth, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.”","21:5":"Yet they said, “Confused dreams! Nay, he has fabricated it! Nay, he is a poet! Let him bring us a sign like those of old were sent!”","21:6":"No town that We destroyed before them believed; will these, then, believe","21:7":"And We sent no messenger before thee, but that they were men unto whom We revealed. So ask the people of the Reminder, if you know not","21:8":"We did not make them bodies that ate not food; nor were they immortal","21:9":"Then We fulfilled the promise unto them, and saved them and whomsoever We willed, and We destroyed the prodigal","21:10":"We have indeed sent down unto you a Book wherein is your Reminder. Do you not understand","21:11":"How many a town engaged in wrongdoing have We shattered, and then brought into being another people after them","21:12":"And when they felt Our Might, behold, they ran away from it","21:13":"“Do not run away! But return to the luxury you have been given and to your dwellings, that haply you may be questioned.”","21:14":"They said, “Oh, woe unto us! Truly we have been wrongdoers.”","21:15":"And that did not cease to be their cry, till We made them a mown field, stilled","21:16":"And We did not create Heaven and earth and whatsoever is between them in play","21:17":"Had We desired to take up a diversion, We would surely have taken it from that which was with Us, were We to do so","21:18":"Nay, but We cast truth against falsehood, and it crushes it, and, behold, it vanishes. And woe unto you for that which you describe","21:19":"Unto Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and on the earth. Those who are with Him are not too arrogant to worship Him; nor do they weary","21:20":"They glorify night and day, without tiring","21:21":"Or have they taken gods from the earth who resurrect","21:22":"Were there gods other than God in them, they would surely have been corrupted. So glory be to God, Lord of the Throne, above that which they ascribe","21:23":"He shall not be questioned about what He does, but they shall be questioned","21:24":"Or have they taken gods apart from Him? Say, “Bring me your proof! This is the Reminder for those who are with me, and the Reminder for those before me. Nay, but most of them do not know the truth; so they turn away.”","21:25":"And We sent no messenger before thee, save that We revealed unto him, “Verily, there is no god but I; so worship Me!”","21:26":"And they say, “The Compassionate has taken a child.” Glory be to Him! Nay, but they are honored servants","21:27":"They precede Him not in speech, and they act according to His Command","21:28":"He knows that which is before them and that which is behind them, and they intercede not, save for one with whom He is content. They are wary, for fear of Him","21:29":"And whosoever among them would say, “Truly I am a god apart from Him,” such will We requite with Hell. Thus do We requite the wrongdoers","21:30":"Have those who disbelieve not considered that the heavens and the earth were sewn together and We rent them asunder? And We made every living thing from water. Will they not, then, believe","21:31":"And We placed firm mountains in the earth, lest it shake beneath them, and We made wide tracts between them as paths, that haply they may be guided","21:32":"And We made the sky a canopy preserved; yet they turn away from its signs","21:33":"He it is Who created the night and the day, the sun and the moon, each gliding in an orbit","21:34":"We have not ordained perpetual life for any human being before thee. So if thou diest, will they abide forever","21:35":"Every soul shall taste death. We try you with evil and with good, as a test, and unto Us shall you be returned","21:36":"And whenever those who disbelieve see thee, they take thee in naught but mockery, “Is this the one who makes mention of your gods?” And it is they who are disbelievers in the remembrance of the Compassionate","21:37":"Man was created of haste. Soon shall I show you My signs; so seek not to hasten Me","21:38":"And they say, “When will this promise come to pass, if you are truthful?”","21:39":"If those who disbelieved but knew of the time when they shall not be able to hold back the Fire from their faces or from their backs, nor be helped","21:40":"Nay, but it will come upon them suddenly, and confound them. Then they will not be able to repel it, nor will they be granted respite","21:41":"Messengers were certainly mocked before thee. Then those who scoffed at them were beset by that which they used to mock","21:42":"Say, “Who will protect you, night and day, from the Compassionate?” Nay, but they turn away from the remembrance of their Lord","21:43":"Or do they have gods to defend them apart from Us? They cannot help themselves; nor are they given protection against Us","21:44":"Nay, but We granted enjoyment to them and their fathers till life grew long for them. Do they not consider how We come upon the land, reducing it of its outlying regions? Is it they who shall prevail","21:45":"Say, “I only warn you through a revelation.” But the deaf do not hear the call however much they are warned","21:46":"And if but a breath of thy Lord’s Punishment were to touch them, they would surely say, “Oh, woe unto us. Truly we were wrongdoers.”","21:47":"We shall set the just scales for the Day of Resurrection, and no soul shall be wronged in aught. Even if it be the weight of a mustard seed, We shall bring it. And We suffice as Reckoner","21:48":"We indeed gave unto Moses and Aaron the Criterion, and a radiant light and a reminder for the reverent","21:49":"who fear their Lord unseen, and who are wary of the Hour","21:50":"This is a blessed Reminder that We have sent down. Will you then deny it","21:51":"And We indeed gave unto Abraham his sound judgment aforetime, and We knew him","21:52":"when he said unto his father and his people, “What are these images to which you are cleaving?”","21:53":"They said, “We found our fathers worshipping them.”","21:54":"He said, “Certainly you and your fathers have been in manifest error.”","21:55":"They said, “Have you brought us the truth, or are you among those who jest?”","21:56":"He said, “Nay, but your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who originated them. And I am among those who bear witness unto this","21:57":"And by God, I shall scheme against your idols after you have turned your backs.”","21:58":"So he broke them into pieces—save the largest of them—that haply they may have recourse to it","21:59":"They said, “Who has done this to our gods? Verily he is among the wrongdoers!”","21:60":"They said, “We heard a young man mention them; he is called Abraham.” a They said, “So bring him before the eyes of the people, that haply they may bear witness.”","21:61":"They said, “Was it you who did this to our gods","21:62":"Abraham?”","21:63":"He said, “Nay, but it was the largest of them that did this. So question them, if they speak!”","21:64":"So they consulted among themselves and said, “Verily it is you who are the wrongdoers!”","21:65":"Then they reverted, “Certainly you know that these speak not!”","21:66":"He said, “Do you worship, apart from God, that which benefits you not in the least, nor harms you","21:67":"Fie upon you, and upon that which you worship apart from God. Do you not understand?”","21:68":"They said, “Burn him, and help your gods, if you would take action!”","21:69":"We said, “O Fire! Be coolness and peace for Abraham.”","21:70":"They desired to scheme against him, but We made them the greatest losers","21:71":"And We delivered him and Lot to the land that We blessed for all peoples","21:72":"And We bestowed upon him Isaac, and Jacob as an added gift. And each of them We made righteous","21:73":"And We made them imams, guiding according to Our Command. And We revealed unto them the doing of good deeds, the performance of prayer, and the giving of alms. And they were worshippers of Us","21:74":"And as for Lot, We gave unto him judgment and knowledge, and We saved him from the town that was committing vile deeds. Truly they were an evil people, iniquitous","21:75":"And We caused him to enter Our Mercy; verily, he was among the righteous","21:76":"And [remember] Noah, when he cried out aforetime, We answered him and saved him and his family from great distress","21:77":"And We helped him against those people who denied Our signs. Truly they were an evil people; so We drowned them all together","21:78":"And [remember] David and Solomon, when they rendered judgment regarding the tillage, when the people’s sheep strayed therein by night. And We were Witness to their judgment","21:79":"We made Solomon to understand it, and unto both We gave judgment and knowledge. We compelled the mountains and the birds to glorify along with David; We did this","21:80":"And We taught him how to make garments for you to protect you against your own might, but are you thankful","21:81":"And unto Solomon, the wind blowing violently: it ran by his command to the land that We had blessed. And We know all things","21:82":"Among the satans are those who dove deep for him, and performed other deeds besides this. And We guarded them","21:83":"And [remember] Job, when he cried unto his Lord, “Truly affliction has befallen me! And Thou art the most Merciful of the merciful.”","21:84":"So We answered him and removed the affliction that was upon him, and We gave him his family, and the like thereof along with them, as a mercy from Us and a reminder to the worshippers","21:85":"And [remember] Ishmael, Idris, and Dhu’l-Kifl—each was among the patient","21:86":"We caused them to enter Our Mercy; truly they are among the righteous","21:87":"And [remember] Dhu’l-Nun, when he went away in anger, and thought We had no power over him. Then he cried out in the darkness, “There is no god but Thee! Glory be to Thee! Truly I have been among the wrongdoers.”","21:88":"So We answered him, and saved him from grief. Thus do We save the believers","21:89":"And [remember] Zachariah, when he cried out to his Lord, “My Lord! Leave me not childless, though Thou art the best of inheritors.”","21:90":"So We answered him, and bestowed John upon him, and We set his wife aright for him. Truly they vied in good deeds. They called upon Us with desire and with fear, and they were humble before Us","21:91":"And as for she who preserved her chastity, We breathed into her of Our Spirit, and made her and her son a sign for the worlds","21:92":"Truly this community of yours is one community, and I am your Lord. So worship Me","21:93":"But they have fragmented their affair among themselves. Each is returning unto Us","21:94":"And whosoever performs righteous deeds and is a believer, there shall be no ingratitude for his endeavor, and surely We shall write [it] down for him","21:95":"And it is forbidden unto any town We have destroyed that they should ever return","21:96":"till the time when Gog and Magog are unleashed, and they rush down from every hill","21:97":"and the true promise draws nigh. And, behold, there shall be the fixed stare of those who disbelieved, “Oh, woe unto us! We have certainly been heedless of this! Indeed, we have been wrongdoers.”","21:98":"Surely you and that which you worship apart from God shall be fuel for Hell. Unto it you shall come","21:99":"Had these been gods, they would not have come unto it. But each shall abide therein","21:100":"Theirs shall be groaning therein, and therein they shall hear not","21:101":"Surely those for whom what is most beautiful has already gone forth from Us; they shall be kept far from it","21:102":"They hear not the slightest sound thereof, while they abide in that which their souls desire","21:103":"The greatest terror will not grieve them, and the angels will receive them. “This is your Day, which you were promised.”","21:104":"That Day We shall roll up the sky like the rolling of scrolls for writings. As We began the first creation, so shall We bring it back—a promise binding upon Us. Surely We shall do it","21:105":"And We have indeed written in the Psalms, after the Reminder, that My righteous servants shall inherit the earth","21:106":"Truly in this is a proclamation for a worshipful people","21:107":"And We sent thee not, save as a mercy unto the worlds","21:108":"Say, “It is only revealed unto me that your God is one God. So will you be submitters?”","21:109":"But if they turn away, say, “I have proclaimed to you all equally. I know not whether that which you are promised is nigh or far off","21:110":"Verily He knows that which is spoken openly and He knows that which you conceal","21:111":"And I know not; perhaps it is a trial for you, and an enjoyment for a while.”","21:112":"He said, “My Lord, judge with truth! Our Lord is the Compassionate, the One Whose help is sought against that which you ascribe.”","22:1":"O mankind! Reverence your Lord. Truly the quaking of the Hour is a tremendous thing","22:2":"On the day you see it, every nursing woman will forget what she nurses, and every pregnant woman will deliver her burden, and you will see mankind drunk, though drunk they will not be. Rather, the Punishment of God is severe","22:3":"And among mankind are those who dispute concerning God, without knowledge, and follow every defiant satan","22:4":"for whom it is decreed that, should anyone take him as a protector, he will cause him to go astray and guide him unto the punishment of the Blaze","22:5":"O mankind! If you are in doubt concerning the Resurrection, [remember] We created you from dust, then from a drop, then from a blood clot, then from a lump of flesh, formed and unformed, that We may make clear for you. And We cause what We will to remain in the wombs for a term appointed. Then We bring you forth as an infant, then that you may reach maturity. And some are taken in death, and some are consigned to the most abject life, so that after having known they may know nothing. And thou seest the earth desiccated, but when We send down water upon it, it stirs and swells and produces every delightful kind","22:6":"That is because God is the Truth, and because He gives life to the dead, and because He is Powerful over all things","22:7":"and because the Hour is coming, in which there is no doubt, and because God will resurrect whosoever is in the graves","22:8":"And among mankind are those who dispute concerning God without knowledge, without guidance, and without an illuminating Book","22:9":"turning aside to cause others to stray from the way of God. Such shall have disgrace in this world, and We shall make him taste the punishment of the burning on the Day of Resurrection","22:10":"That is because of what your hands have sent forth, and because God wrongs not His servants","22:11":"And among mankind some worship God upon a brink: if good befalls him, he is content thereby, but if a trial befalls him, he is turned over upon his face, losing this world and the Hereafter. That is the manifest loss","22:12":"He calls, apart from God, upon that which neither harms him nor benefits him. That is extreme error","22:13":"He calls upon one whose harm is likelier than his benefit. What an evil ally, and what an evil friend","22:14":"Truly God will cause those who believe and perform righteous deeds to enter Gardens with rivers running below. Truly God does whatsoever He desires","22:15":"Whosoever thinks that God will not help him in this world and the Hereafter, let him stretch out a rope to Heaven. Then let him sever it and see if his scheming removes that which enrages","22:16":"Thus do We send it down as clear signs, and thus does God guide whomsoever He desires","22:17":"As for those who believe, and those who are Jews, the Sabeans, the Christians, the Magians, and the idolaters, indeed God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. Truly God is Witness over all things","22:18":"Hast thou not considered that unto God prostrates whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, and the beasts, and many among mankind? But for many the punishment has come due. Whomsoever God disgraces, none can ennoble. Truly God does whatsoever He will","22:19":"These two adversaries dispute concerning their Lord. As for those who disbelieve, garments of fire shall be cut for them, and boiling liquid shall be poured over their heads","22:20":"by which their innards and their skin will be melted","22:21":"And for them shall be hooked iron rods","22:22":"Whensoever they desire, in their grief, to leave it, they shall be returned unto it, while [being told], “Taste the punishment of the burning!”","22:23":"Truly God will cause those who believe and perform righteous deeds to enter Gardens with rivers running below, adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearl, and therein their clothes will be of silk","22:24":"And they shall be guided unto that which is good in speech, and be guided unto the path of the Praised","22:25":"Truly those who disbelieve and turn from the way of God, and the Sacred Mosque which We have appointed for mankind—equal are those who dwell there and those who come from abroad—whosoever desires to deviate wrongfully therein, We shall cause him to taste a painful punishment","22:26":"And [remember] when We assigned for Abraham the place of the House, [saying], “Ascribe no partners unto Me, and purify My House for those who circumambulate, and those who stand, and those who bow and prostrate","22:27":"And proclaim the ?ajj among mankind: they shall come to thee on foot and upon all [manner of] lean beast, coming from all deep and distant mountain highways","22:28":"that they may witness benefits for them and mention the Name of God, during known days, over the four-legged cattle He has provided them. So eat thereof, and feed the wretched poor","22:29":"Then let them be done with their untidiness, and fulfill their vows, and circumambulate the Ancient House.”","22:30":"Thus it is. And whosoever magnifies the sacred things of God, that is better for him in the eyes of his Lord. Cattle are permitted you, save that which is recited unto you. So shun the filth of idols, and shun false speech","22:31":"as ?anifs before God, not ascribing partners unto Him. And whosoever ascribes partners unto God, it is as if he fell from the sky and the birds snatched him, or the wind swept him away to a place far off","22:32":"Thus it is. And whosoever magnifies the rituals of God, truly that comes from the reverence of hearts","22:33":"You shall have benefits in them, for a term appointed. Thereafter their lawful place of sacrifice shall be at the Ancient House","22:34":"For every community We have appointed a rite, that they might mention the Name of God over the four-legged cattle He has provided them. Your God is one God; so submit unto Him, and give glad tidings to the humble","22:35":"whose hearts quiver when God is mentioned, and who bear patiently what befalls them, who perform the prayer, and who spend of that which We have provided them","22:36":"And We have placed the sacrificial camels for you among God’s rituals. There is good for you in them. So mention the Name of God over them as they line up. Then when they have fallen upon their flanks, eat of them, and feed the needy who solicit and those who do not. Thus have We made them subservient unto you, that haply you may give thanks","22:37":"Neither their flesh nor their blood will reach God, but the reverence from you reaches Him. Thus has He made them subservient unto you, that you might magnify God for having guided you. And give glad tidings to the virtuous","22:38":"Truly God defends those who believe. Truly God loves not any ungrateful traitor","22:39":"Permission is granted to those who are fought, because they have been wronged—and truly God is able to help them—","22:40":"who were expelled from their homes without right, only for saying, “Our Lord is God.” Were it not for God’s repelling people, some by means of others, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, wherein God’s Name is mentioned much, would have been destroyed.

And [how many] an abandoned well and lofty palace","22:46":"Have they not journeyed upon the earth, that they might have hearts by which to understand or ears by which to hear? Truly it is not the eyes that go blind, but it is hearts within breasts that go blind","22:47":"They bid thee to hasten the punishment, though God will not fail His Promise. And truly a day with your Lord is as a thousand years of that which you reckon","22:48":"And how many a town did I grant respite while it did wrong.

I am only a clear warner unto you!”","22:50":"And as for those who believe and perform righteous deeds, theirs shall be forgiveness and a generous provision","22:51":"But those who endeavor to thwart Our signs, they shall be the inhabitants of Hellfire","22:52":"And no messenger or prophet did We send before thee, but that when he had a longing, Satan would cast into his longing, whereupon God effaces what Satan cast. Then God makes firm His signs—and God is Knowing, Wise—","22:53":"that He might make what Satan casts to be a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease, and those whose hearts are hard—and truly the wrongdoers are in extreme schism—","22:54":"and so that those who have been given knowledge might know that it is the truth from thy Lord, and thus believe in it, and that their hearts be humbled before Him.

We shall see if she is rightly guided or if she is among those who are not rightly guided.”","27:42":"Then when she came, it was said, “Is your throne like this?” She said, “It seems the same.” [Solomon said], “And we were given knowledge before her and we were submitters","27:43":"while that which she worshipped apart from God barred her; verily she was from a disbelieving people.”","27:44":"It was said unto her, “Enter the pavilion.” But when she saw it, she supposed it to be an expanse of water and bared her legs. He said, “Verily it is a pavilion paved with crystal.” She said, “My Lord! Surely I have wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to God, Lord of the worlds.”","27:45":"And indeed We sent to Thamud their brother ?ali?, [saying], “Worship God!” And behold, they were two groups, quarreling","27:46":"He said, “O my people! Why do you seek to hasten evil before good? Why do you not seek Forgiveness of God, that haply you may be shown mercy?”","27:47":"They said, “We augur ill of you and of those with you.” He said, “Your auguring ill is with God. Rather, you are a people being tried.”","27:48":"And in the city there were nine persons working corruption in the land and not setting matters aright","27:49":"They said, “Swear by God to each other that we shall attack him and his family by night. Then we shall surely say to his heir that we were not present at the destruction of his family and that surely we are truthful.”","27:50":"And they devised a plot, and We devised a plot, while they were not aware","27:51":"So behold how their plot fared in the end; truly We destroyed them and their people all together","27:52":"And those are their houses, lying desolate for their having done wrong. Surely in this is a sign for a people who know","27:53":"We saved those who believed and were reverent","27:54":"And [We sent] Lot, when he said to his people, “Do you commit indecency, though you see","27:55":"Do you really come with desire unto men instead of women? Nay, but you are an ignorant people!”","27:56":"Yet the reply of his people was naught but to say, “Expel the family of Lot from your town! Truly they are people who keep themselves pure!”","27:57":"So We saved him and his family, except for his wife. We decreed that she should be among those who lagged behind","27:58":"And We poured down upon them a rain—evil is the rain of those who were warned","27:59":"Say, “Praise be to God, and peace be upon His servants whom He has chosen.” Is God better, or the partners they ascribe","27:60":"He, Who created the heavens and the earth, and sent down water for you from the sky, through which We make grow beautiful gardens, whose trees it is not for you to make grow? Is there a god alongside God? Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals","27:61":"He, Who made the earth a dwelling place, and made rivers to run through it, and made firm mountains for it, and made between the two seas a barrier? Is there a god alongside God? Nay, but most of them know not","27:62":"He, Who answers the one in distress when he calls upon Him and removes the evil, and Who makes you vicegerents of the earth? Is there a god alongside God? Little do you reflect","27:63":"He, Who guides you in the darkness of land and sea, and sends the winds as glad tidings ahead of His Mercy? Is there a god alongside God? Exalted is God above the partners they ascribe","27:64":"He, Who brings creation into being, then brings it back, and Who provides for you from Heaven and the earth? Is there a god alongside God? Say, “Bring your proof, if you are truthful.”","27:65":"Say, “None in the heavens or on the earth know the Unseen, save God. And they are not aware of when they will be resurrected.”","27:66":"Nay, but does their knowledge reach to the Hereafter? Nay, but they are in doubt concerning it; indeed, they are blind to it","27:67":"And those who disbelieve say, “What? When we and our fathers are dust, shall we indeed be brought forth","27:68":"Indeed, we were promised this, we and our fathers, before. This is naught but fables of those of old!”","27:69":"Say, “Journey upon the earth and behold how the guilty fared in the end!”","27:70":"And grieve not for them, and be not distressed by what they plot","27:71":"And they say, “When will this promise come to pass, if you are truthful?”","27:72":"Say, “It may be that some of what you seek to hasten is close behind you.”","27:73":"And truly thy Lord is Possessed of Bounty toward mankind, but most of them do not give thanks","27:74":"And surely thy Lord knows that which their breasts conceal and that which they disclose","27:75":"And there is nothing hidden in Heaven or on the earth, but that it is in a clear Book","27:76":"Verily, this Quran recounts unto the Children of Israel most of that wherein they differ","27:77":"and verily it is a guidance and a mercy for the believers","27:78":"Verily thy Lord shall judge between them by His Judgment, and He is the Mighty, the Knowing","27:79":"So trust in God; truly thou standest upon the manifest truth","27:80":"Surely thou dost not make the dead hear; nor dost thou make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs","27:81":"nor canst thou guide the blind away from their error. Thou canst only make hear those who believe in Our signs and are submitters","27:82":"And when the Word comes upon them, We shall bring forth for them a beast from the earth who will speak to them of how mankind was not certain of Our signs","27:83":"And on that Day We shall gather from every community a group of those who denied Our signs, and they shall be marshaled [in ordered ranks]","27:84":"till, when they come, He will say, “Did you deny My signs, though you encompassed them not in knowledge? What is it that you used to do?”","27:85":"And the Word will come upon them for their having done wrong, and they shall not speak","27:86":"Have they not considered that We made the night that they might rest therein, and the day by which to see? Truly in that are signs for a people who believe","27:87":"And on that Day the trumpet will be blown, and whosoever is in the heavens and on the earth will be terrified, save whom God wills, and all will come to Him in abject humility","27:88":"And thou seest the mountains that thou dost suppose are solid pass away like clouds—the Work of God, Who perfects all things. Truly He is Aware of whatsoever you do","27:89":"Whosoever brings a good deed, he will have that which is better than it. And that Day they will be secure from terror","27:90":"And whosoever brings an evil deed, their faces shall be cast down into the Fire.

And I am commanded to be among those who submit","27:92":"and to recite the Quran. So whosoever is rightly guided, he is guided only for his own soul. And [as for] whosoever is astray, say, “Verily, I am but a warner.”","27:93":"And say, “Praise be to God! He will show you His signs, and you will know them.” And thy Lord is not heedless of what you do","28:1":"Sin. Mim","28:2":"These are the signs of the clear Book","28:3":"We recite unto thee in truth some of the account of Moses and Pharaoh, for a people who believe","28:4":"Indeed, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land, and made its people into factions, oppressing a party among them, slaying their sons and sparing their women. Verily he was among those who work corruption","28:5":"Yet We desired to be gracious to those who were oppressed in the land, and to make them imams, and to make them the heirs","28:6":"and to establish them in the land, and to show Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts that which they dreaded from them","28:7":"So We revealed to the mother of Moses, “Nurse him. But if you fear for him, then cast him into the river, and fear not, nor grieve. Surely We shall bring him back to you and make him one of the messengers.”","28:8":"Then the House of Pharaoh picked him up, such that he would become unto them an enemy and a sorrow. Truly Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were sinners","28:9":"And the wife of Pharaoh said, “A comfort for me and for you! Slay him not; it may be that he will bring us some benefit, or that we may take him as a son.” Yet they were unaware","28:10":"But the heart of Moses’ mother became empty, and she would have disclosed it, had We not fortified her heart, that she might be among the believers","28:11":"And she said to his sister, “Follow him.” So she watched him from afar; yet they were unaware","28:12":"And We forbade him to be suckled by foster mothers before that; so she said, “Shall I direct you to the people of a house who will take care of him for you and treat him with good will?”","28:13":"Thus We returned him to his mother, that she might be comforted and not grieve, and that she might know that God’s Promise is true. But most of them know not","28:14":"When he reached maturity and was firmly established [in life], We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus do We recompense the virtuous","28:15":"He entered the city at a time of heedlessness among its people. And he found therein two men fighting—one from among his own faction and the other from among his enemies. Then the one from among his own faction sought his aid against the one who was from among his enemies; so Moses struck him with his fist and put an end to him. He said, “This is the work of Satan! Truly he is a manifest enemy, leading astray.”","28:16":"He said, “My Lord! Truly I have wronged my own soul. Forgive me.” So He forgave him. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful","28:17":"He said, “My Lord! Because Thou hast blessed me, I shall never be a supporter of the guilty.”","28:18":"Morning found him in the city, fearful and vigilant, and behold, the one who had sought his help the day before cried out to him for help! Moses said to him, “Truly you are clearly in error.”","28:19":"But when he desired to strike him who was an enemy unto them both, he said, “O Moses! Do you desire to slay me, as you slew a soul yesterday? You desire naught but to be a tyrant on the earth, and you desire not to be among the workers of righteousness.”","28:20":"Then from the outskirts of the city a man came running. He said, “O Moses! Truly the notables are conspiring against you, that they might slay you. So leave! Truly I am among your sincere advisers.”","28:21":"So he left from there, fearful and vigilant. He said, “My Lord! Save me from the wrongdoing people!”","28:22":"And when he turned his face toward Midian, he said, “Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the right way.”","28:23":"And when he arrived at the wells of Midian, he found there a community of people watering [their flocks]. And he found beside them two women holding back [their flocks]. He said, “What is your errand?” They said, “We water not [our flocks] until the shepherds have driven [theirs] away, and our father is a very old man.”","28:24":"So he watered [their flocks] for them. Then he turned toward the shade and said, “My Lord! Truly I am in need of any good that Thou mayest send down upon me.”","28:25":"Then one of the two came to him, walking bashfully. She said, “Truly my father summons you, that he might render unto you a reward for having watered [our flocks] for us.” When he came and recounted his story unto him, he said, “Fear not. You have been saved from the wrongdoing people.”","28:26":"One of the two said, “O my father! Hire him. Surely the best [man] you can hire is the strong, the trustworthy.”","28:27":"He said, “I desire to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine, on condition that you hire yourself to me for eight years. But if you complete ten, that will be of your own accord. And I desire not to be hard upon you. You shall find me, if God wills, to be among the righteous.”","28:28":"He said, “So let it be between you and me. Whichever of the two terms I complete, let there be no enmity toward me. And God is Guardian over what we say.”","28:29":"Then when Moses had completed the term and set out with his family, he perceived a fire on the side of the Mount. He said to his family, “Stay here. I perceive a fire. Perhaps I will bring you some news therefrom, or a firebrand, that haply you may warm yourselves.”","28:30":"And when he came upon it, he was called from the right bank of the valley, at the blessed site, from the tree, “O Moses! Truly I am God, Lord of the worlds!”","28:31":"and, “Cast thy staff!” Then when he saw it quivering like a serpent, he turned in retreat without returning. “O Moses! Approach and fear not! Truly, thou art of those who are secure","28:32":"Insert thy hand in thy bosom; it will come forth white, without blemish. And draw thine arms to thyself against fear. These are two proofs from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his notables. Verily they are an iniquitous people.”","28:33":"He said, “My Lord! Verily I have killed a soul among them, and I fear that they will slay me","28:34":"And my brother, Aaron, is more eloquent than me in speech. So send him with me as a helper to confirm me, for I fear they will deny me.”","28:35":"He said, “We shall strengthen thine arm through thy brother, and We shall grant an authority for both of you, such that they shall not reach you. With Our signs, you and those who follow you shall be the victors.”","28:36":"But when Moses brought them Our clear signs, they said, “This is naught but fabricated sorcery. We heard this not among our fathers of old.”","28:37":"Moses said, “My Lord knows best who brings guidance from Him, and whose end is the Abode. Truly the wrongdoers will not prosper.”","28:38":"Pharaoh said, “O notables! I know of no god for you other than myself. So kindle for me a fire, O Haman, for clay, and make me a tower, that haply I may behold the God of Moses, though truly I think he is among the liars.”","28:39":"And he and his hosts waxed arrogant upon the earth, without right, and they thought they would not be returned unto Us","28:40":"So We seized him and his hosts, and cast them into the sea. So behold how the wrongdoers fared in the end","28:41":"And We made them imams calling unto the Fire. And on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped","28:42":"And We caused them to be pursued by a curse in this world. And on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the repugnant","28:43":"And indeed We gave unto Moses the Book—after We had destroyed the former generations—as a [source of] insight for mankind, and guidance and mercy, that haply they may reflect","28:44":"And thou wast not on the western side when We decreed unto Moses the Commandment, and thou wast not among the witnesses","28:45":"But it is We Who brought into being the generations, and lives grew long for them. And thou dwelt not among the people of Midian, reciting unto them Our signs. But it is We Who sent","28:46":"And thou wast not on the side of the Mount when We called out. But [thou art sent as] a mercy from thy Lord that thou mayest warn a people unto whom no warner has come before thee, that haply they may remember","28:47":"And [We did so] lest there be an affliction that would befall them because of that which their hands have sent forth at which they should say, “Our Lord! If only Thou hadst sent a messenger unto us, we would have followed Thy signs and been among the believers!”","28:48":"But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “Why was he not given the like of that which was given to Moses?” Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Moses aforetime? They said, “Two sorceries, supporting one another.” And they said, “Truly we are disbelievers in each.”","28:49":"Say, “So bring a book from God that provides better guidance than these two, that I may follow it, if you are truthful.”","28:50":"And if they respond not to thee, then know that they follow only their caprices. And who is more astray than one who follows his caprice without guidance from God? Surely God guides not wrongdoing people","28:51":"And indeed We have caused the Word to reach them, that haply they may reflect","28:52":"Those unto whom We gave the Book before it, they are believers in it","28:53":"And when it is recited unto them, they say, “We believe in it; verily it is the truth from our Lord. Truly we were submitters even before it.”","28:54":"It is they who will be given their reward twice over for their having been patient. And they repel evil with good, and spend from that which We have provided them","28:55":"And when they hear idle talk, they turn away therefrom and say, “Unto us our deeds, and unto you your deeds. Peace be upon you! We do not seek out the ignorant.”","28:56":"Surely thou dost not guide whomsoever thou lovest, but God guides whomsoever He will. And He knows best those who are rightly guided","28:57":"And they say, “If we follow guidance along with thee, we shall be snatched away from our land.” Have We not established for them a secure Sanctuary, to which the fruits of all things are brought, as a provision from Our Presence? But most of them know not","28:58":"And how many a town have We destroyed who exulted in their life of ease. There are their dwellings, uninhabited after them save for a few. And We, truly, are the Inheritor","28:59":"And thy Lord never destroys towns until He sends a messenger to their mother city to recite unto them Our signs. And We never destroy towns, save when their people are wrongdoers","28:60":"And whatsoever you have been given, it is an enjoyment of the life of this world, and its ornament. But that which lies with God is better and more lasting. Will you not understand","28:61":"And is he unto whom We made a goodly promise and who receives it, like unto him whom We granted enjoyment in the life of this world and who then, on the Day of Resurrection, will be among those arraigned","28:62":"And on the Day when he shall call out to them, and say, “Where are My partners, those whom you claimed?”","28:63":"Those against whom the Word has already come due will say, “Our Lord! These are those whom we perverted. We perverted them as we ourselves were perverse. We disavow [them] before Thee; it was not us whom they worshipped.”","28:64":"It will be said, “Call upon your partners.” So they will call upon them, but they will not answer them. And they will see the punishment—if only they had been rightly guided","28:65":"And on the Day when He will call out to them and say, “What answer gave you to the message bearers?”","28:66":"the tidings shall be obscured for them on that Day, and they shall not question one another","28:67":"But for he who repented, believed, and worked righteousness, perchance he will be among those who prosper","28:68":"And thy Lord creates what He will, and chooses; no choice have they. Glory be to God and exalted is He above the partners they ascribe","28:69":"And thy Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they disclose","28:70":"And He is God; there is no god but He! To Him belongs praise at the beginning and at the end. To Him belongs judgment, and unto Him shall you be returned","28:71":"Say, “Have you considered: if God should make night come over you unceasingly until the Day of Resurrection, what god other than God would bring you light? Will you not, then, listen?”","28:72":"Say, “Have you considered: if God should make day come over you unceasingly until the Day of Resurrection, what god other than God would bring you night, that you might rest therein? Will you not, then, see?”","28:73":"Out of His Mercy He made for you night and day, that you may rest therein, and that you may seek of His Bounty, and that haply you may give thanks","28:74":"And on the Day when He shall call out to them, He will say, “Where are My partners, those whom you claimed?”","28:75":"And We shall draw forth from every community a witness, and say, “Bring your proof.” Then they will know that the truth belongs to God. And that which they used to fabricate will forsake them","28:76":"Truly Korah was of the people of Moses, but he transgressed against them. And We gave him such treasure that the keys to it would be a heavy burden for a group of strong men. [Remember] when his people said to him, “Exult not! Surely God loves not the exultant","28:77":"And with what God has given you, seek after the Abode of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion in this world. And be good, as God has been good to you. Seek not to work corruption upon the earth. Surely God loves not the workers of corruption.”","28:78":"He said, “I have only been given it on account of knowledge I possess.” Did he not know that God has destroyed generations before him who were mightier in strength and greater in what they had amassed? And the guilty will not be questioned about their sins","28:79":"And he came forth unto his people in his adornment. Those who desired the life of this world said, “Would that we had the like of that which has been given to Korah. Truly he is a possessor of great fortune!”","28:80":"But those who had been given knowledge said, “Woe unto you! The Reward of God is better for those who believe and work righteousness, and none shall receive it save the patient.”","28:81":"Then We caused the earth to engulf him and his house. And he had no party who could help him against God, nor could he help himself","28:82":"And morning found those who had longed to be in his place the day before saying, “Alas! It seems God outspreads and straitens provision for whomsoever He will among His servants. Had God not been gracious to us, He would have caused us to be engulfed [as well]. Alas! It seems the disbelievers will not prosper!”","28:83":"That is the Abode of the Hereafter, which We ordain for those who desire neither dominance upon the earth, nor corruption. And the end belongs to the reverent","28:84":"Whosoever brings a good deed, he shall have better than it; and whosoever brings an evil deed, those who perform evil deeds shall only be recompensed for that which they have done","28:85":"Truly the One Who ordained the Quran for thee shall surely bring thee back to the place of return. Say, “My Lord knows best those who bring guidance, and those who are in manifest error.”","28:86":"And thou didst not hope that the Book would be delivered unto thee; rather, it was a mercy from thy Lord. So be not a support for the disbelievers","28:87":"And let them not turn thee from the signs of God after they have been sent down unto thee. But call [others] to thy Lord and be not among those who ascribe partners unto God","28:88":"And call not upon another god along with God. There is no god but He! All things perish, save His Face. Judgment belongs to Him, and unto Him will you be returned","29:1":"Alif. Lam. Mim","29:2":"Does mankind suppose that they will be left to say, “We believe,” and that they will not be tried","29:3":"though We have indeed tried those who were before them? Surely God knows those who are truthful, and surely He knows the liars","29:4":"Or do those who commit evil deeds suppose that they will outstrip Us? Evil indeed is the judgment they make","29:5":"Whosoever hopes for the meeting with God, God’s term is coming. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing","29:6":"And whosoever strives, strives only for himself. Truly God is beyond need of the worlds","29:7":"And those who believe and perform righteous deeds, We shall surely absolve them of their evil deeds, and We shall surely recompense them according to the best of that which they used to do","29:8":"And We have enjoined man to be good unto his parents. But if they urge thee to ascribe as partner unto Me that whereof thou hast no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return, whereupon I shall inform you of that which you used to do","29:9":"And those who believe and perform righteous deeds, We shall surely cause them to enter among the righteous","29:10":"Among mankind are those who say, “We believe in God”; but if he is harmed for the sake of God, he takes persecution from men to be as God’s Punishment. Yet if help comes from thy Lord, he will surely say, “We were indeed with you.” Does God not know best what lies within the breasts of all creatures","29:11":"Surely God knows those who believe, and surely He knows the hypocrites","29:12":"Those who disbelieve say to those who believe, “Follow our path and we shall bear your sins.” But they bear not aught of their sins. Truly they are liars","29:13":"Surely they will bear their own burdens, and others’ burdens along with their own, and on the Day of Resurrection they will surely be questioned concerning that which they used to fabricate","29:14":"And indeed We sent Noah unto his people and he remained among them a thousand years, less fifty; and the flood seized them, for they were wrongdoers","29:15":"Then We saved him and the companions of the ship, and We made it a sign for the worlds","29:16":"And [We sent] Abraham, when he said to his people, “Worship God and reverence Him. That is better for you, if you but knew","29:17":"You only worship idols apart from God, and you only create perversion. Truly those whom you worship apart from God have no power over what provision may come to you. So seek your provision with God, worship Him, and be thankful to Him; unto Him shall you be returned","29:18":"But if you deny, then communities have certainly denied before you; and naught is incumbent upon the Messenger but the clear proclamation.”","29:19":"Have they not considered how God originates creation, then brings it back? Truly that is easy for God","29:20":"Say, “Journey upon the earth and observe how He originated creation. Then God shall bring the next genesis into being. Truly God is Powerful over all things.”","29:21":"He punishes whomsoever He will and has mercy upon whomsoever He will, and unto Him will you be returned","29:22":"You thwart not on earth, nor in Heaven; and apart from God you have no protector or helper","29:23":"Those who disbelieve in God’s signs and in the meeting with Him, they despair of My Mercy, and for them there shall be a painful punishment","29:24":"Yet the answer of his people was but to say, “Slay him, or burn him!” Then God saved him from the fire. Truly in that are signs for a people who believe","29:25":"And Abraham said, “You have taken idols apart from God on account of affection between you in the life of this world. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will disown one another, and you will curse one another; your refuge will be the Fire, and you will have no helpers.”","29:26":"And Lot believed him and said, “Truly I am fleeing unto my Lord. Truly He is the Mighty, the Wise.”","29:27":"And We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob, and We established prophethood and scripture among his progeny. We gave him his reward in this world, and in the Hereafter he shall truly be among the righteous","29:28":"And [We sent] Lot, when he said to his people, “Truly you commit indecency such as none in the worlds committed before you","29:29":"What! Do you come unto men, cut off the way, and commit reprehensible deeds in your gatherings?” Yet the answer of his people was but to say, “Bring us God’s Punishment, if you are among the truthful.”","29:30":"He said, “My Lord, help me against the people who work corruption.”","29:31":"And when Our envoys came unto Abraham with glad tidings, they said, “We shall surely destroy the people of this town; truly its people are wrongdoers.”","29:32":"He said, “Verily, Lot is in it.” They said, “We know better who is in it. Assuredly We shall save him and his family, save for his wife; she is among those who lagged behind.”","29:33":"And when Our envoys came unto Lot, he was distressed on their account; yet he was constrained from helping them.

Worship God and hope for the Last Day, and behave not wickedly upon the earth, working corruption.”","29:37":"But they denied him, and so the earthquake seized them, and morning found them lying lifeless in their abode","29:38":"and ?Ad, and Thamud; [their fate] is certainly evident to you from their dwellings. Satan made their deeds seem fair unto them and thus turned them from the way, though they had been discerning","29:39":"and Korah, and Pharaoh, and Haman! Indeed, Moses brought them clear proofs, but they waxed arrogant upon the earth, and outstripped [Us] not","29:40":"Each We seized for his sin.
