No fear will fall on them nor will they be saddened","3:171":"they will rejoice because of favor and bounty from God, since God does not deprive believers of their wages","3:172":"Any persons who respond to God and the Messenger after some sore has afflicted them, those who act kindly and do their duty, will have a splendid fee","3:173":"Those whom people have told: ´Some people have gathered to [oppose] you, so be on your guard against them!´; yet it increased them in faith and they said: \"God is our Reckoning, and how splendid is such an Administrator!´","3:174":"They returned home with favor and bounty from God; no evil ever touched them because they followed God´s pleasure. God possesses such splendid bounty","3:175":"That was only Satan who intimidated his adherents. Do not fear them and [instead] fear Me, if you are believers","3:176":"Let not those who hasten on to disbelief sadden you; they will never injure God in any way. God wants to grant them no fortune in the Hereafter, where they will have terrible torment","3:177":"Those who purchase disbelief at the price of faith will never injure God in any way, while they will have painful torment","3:178":"Let not those who disbelieve consider how Our acting indulgent with them is good so far as their own persons are concerned: We are merely postponing things for them so they may increase in vice; they will have disgraceful torment","3:179":"God is no One to leave believers where you are now, until He sorts out bad from good. It is not God´s role to acquaint you with the Unseen, but God chooses anyone He wishes from among His messengers. So believe in God and His messenger; if you believe and do your duty, you will have a splendid fee","3:180":"Let not those who act niggardly with any of His bounty God has given them consider it is better for them; rather it will be worse for them: they will be charged on Resurrection Day with anything they were so niggardly about. God holds the inheritance of Heaven and Earth; God is Informed about anything you do","3:181":"God has heard the statement of those who say: \"God is poor while we are rich!\" We will write down whatever they say and how they killed the prophets without any right to [do so]. We will say: \"Taste the torment of burning","3:182":"That [has happened] because of what your hands sent on ahead. God is no One to harm [His] worshippers","3:183":"such as those who say: \"God has charged us not to believe in any messenger until He brings us some offering which fire will consume.\" SAY: \"Messengers before me have already brought you explanations and just what you have said; why did you kill them if you are so truthful","3:184":"If they reject you, messengers before you have already been rejected when they came even with explanations, the Psalms and the Enlightening Book","3:185":"Every soul will be tasting death: you will merely be repaid your earnings on Resurrection Day. Anyone who is snatched from the Fire and shown into the Garden will have triumphed. What does worldly life mean except the enjoyment of illusion","3:186":"You will be tested by means of your wealth and through your own selves, and you will hear much abuse from those who were given the Book before you, as well as those who associate [others with God]. If you are patient and do your duty, that is what will determine matters","3:187":"When God made an agreement with those who were given the Book [saying]: \"You shall explain it to mankind and not conceal it,\" they tossed it away behind their backs and sold it for a paltry price. How wretched was what they bought [instead]","3:188":"Do not consider those who feel delighted about what they have been given and love to be praised for something they have not done, do not reckon they [have found] any means to triumph over torment. They will have painful torment","3:189":"God holds control over Heaven and Earth; God is Capable of everything","3:190":"In the creation of Heaven and Earth, and the alternation between night and daylight, there are signs for prudent persons","3:191":"who remember God while standing, sifting and [lying] on their sides, and meditate on the creation of Heaven and Earth [by saying]: \"Our Lord, You have not created this in vain! Glory be to You! Shield us from the torment of Fire","3:192":"´Our Lord, anyone You sentence to the Fire, You will humiliate. Wrongdoers will have no supporters","3:193":"Our Lord, we heard a crier appealing for belief, [calling out]: ´Believe in your Lord;´ and so we have believed.\" Our Lord, forgive us our offences, remove our evil deeds from us, and gather us up [at death] with the virtuous","3:194":"Our Lord, give us what you have promised us through Your messengers, and do not humiliate us on Resurrection Day. You never go back on any promise","3:195":"So their Lord responded to them: \"I shall never waste the work of any worker among you, whether it is a man or a woman. Some of you [have sprung] from others. I shall remove their evil deeds for those who have migrated and were driven out of their homes and mistreated for My sake, and have fought and were killed; and I shall admit them to a Garden through which rivers flow, as a prize from God Himself. God holds the finest prize","3:196":"Do not let it deceive you how those who disbelieve bustle about the land","3:197":"[it means such] brief enjoyment; then their refuge will be Hell, and how awful will be such a couch","3:198":"However those who heed their Lord will have gardens through which rivers flow, to live in forever as a welcome from God. What God possesses is best for the virtuous","3:199":"Some People of the Book do believe in God and what has been sent down to you and what has been sent down to them, acting reverently towards God. They do not sell God´s signs for a paltry price: those will receive their wages from their Lord; God is Prompt in reckoning","3:200":"You who believe, act patient, discipline yourselves, and hold yourselves ready! Heed God so that you may succeed","4:1":"Mankind, heed your Lord Who has created you from a single soul, and created its mate from it, and propagated so many men and women from them both. Heed God through Whom you hold one another responsible, as well as any ties of kinship. God is Watching over you","4:2":"Give orphans their property and do not substitute something bad for something good nor swallow up their wealth along with your own wealth. It would be a great outrage","4:3":"If you are afraid you will not deal fairly with orphans, then marry off such women as may seem good to you, in pairs, or three or four [at a time]. If you [still] fear you will not act justly, then [marry] one woman [only] or someone your right hand controls. That is more likely to keep you from committing an injustice","4:4":"Give women their marriage portions with no strings attached. If they themselves waive some of it for you, then consume it at leisure and with good cheer","4:5":"Do not give the feebleminded your property which God has granted you for [their] support; provide for them out of it, and clothe them and address them decently","4:6":"Test orphans as soon as they reach a marriageable age. If you are sure of their maturity, then turn their property over to them; do not use it up extravagantly, over-anxious lest they should grow up. Anyone who is rich should restrain himself, while anyone who is poor may live off it in decency. Whenever you hand their property over to them, have it witnessed for them. God suffices as a Reckoner","4:7":"Men shall have a portion of whatever parents and near relatives leave, while women should have a portion of whatever parents and near relatives leave; no matter how small nor how large it is, a portion is stipulated","4:8":"When near relatives, orphans and paupers are present at the probate, provide for them out of it and speak politely to them","4:9":"Let anyone act cautiously just as they themselves would fear to leave helpless offspring behind; let them heed God and speak in a proper manner","4:10":"Those who live off orphans´ property without having any right to do so will only suck up fire into their bellies, and they will (eventually) roast in a blaze","4:11":"God instructs you concerning your children: a son should have a share equivalent to that of two daughters. If the women [left behind] are more than two, then two-thirds of whatever he leaves belongs to them; yet if there is only one, then she has half. Both his parents shall each receive a sixth of whatever he may leave, if he had a son. If he had no son, and both his parents inherit from him, then his mother receives a third. If he has siblings, then his mother will have a sixth, once the will or any [outstanding] debt has been settled. You do not know whether your parents or your children are closer to you in usefulness, as an obligation [laid down] by God, for God is Aware, Wise","4:12":"You will have half of anything your wives leave, provided they have no child. If they should leave a child, then you will have a fourth of whatever they may leave, once the will has been settled or any [outstanding] debt; while they [your widows] will have a fourth of anything you leave provided you have left no child. Should you have a child, then they will have an eighth of anything you leave, after settling any legacy or debt. If either a man or a woman bequeaths anything to more distant kin while he still has a brother or sister, then each one of them will have a sixth. If there are more than that, then they should be partners in a third after settling any legacy or debt, yet without causing any hardship. It is an instruction from God; God is Aware, Lenient","4:13":"These are God´s limits. Anyone who obeys God and His messenger will be admitted to gardens through which rivers flow, to live there forever. That will be the supreme Achievement","4:14":"Anyone who disobeys God and His messenger and oversteps His limits, will be shown into a Fire to live there forever; he will have humiliating torment","4:15":"Should any of your women commit some sexual offence, collect evidence about them from four [persons] among yourselves. If they so testify, then confine the women to their houses until death claims them or God grants them some other way out","4:16":"If two of you should indulge in it, trounce them both. If they repent and reform, then ostracize them both. God is Relenting, Merciful","4:17":"Repentance holds with God only for those who do evil out of ignorance, then repent shortly after; those God turns to. God is Aware, Wise","4:18":"Repentance is not for those who perform evil deeds until one of them says: \"I have just now repented!\", just as death faces him. Nor is it for those who die while they are disbelievers; for those We reserved painful torment","4:19":"You who believe, it is not lawful for you to inherit anything from women against their will; do not hinder them from remarrying so that you may make off with part of what you have given them, unless they indulge in flagrant sexual misconduct. Treat them politely; even if you dislike them, perhaps you dislike something in which God has placed much good","4:20":"If you want to exchange one wife for another, and have given one of them a large sum of money, do not hold back any of it. Would you withhold it through slander and open sin","4:21":"How can you hold it back when you have had intercourse with each other, and they have made a solemn agreement with you","4:22":"Do not marry any women whom your fathers have already married, unless this is a thing of the past; it is a shocking act and disgusting, and the worst possible way","4:23":"Forbidden to you [in marriage] are your mothers, your [own] daughters, your sisters, your aunts on your father´s side as well as your aunts on your mother´s side, and your brother´s and your sister´s daughter your foster mothers and your foster sisters, your mothers-in-law and step daughters who are under your guardianship [since their mothers are] wives of yours with whom you have consummated marriage (however if you have not consummated it with them, it will not be held against you), and the wives of your sons who are your own flesh-and-blood; nor may you bring two sisters together [under one roof] unless this is a thing of the past. God is Forgiving, Merciful","4:24":"Nor [should you marry] any [already] married women, except the ones under your control. [Such is] God´s legislation as it applies to you. Anything beyond that is lawful for you, provided you court them by means of your wealth, marrying them properly, rather than taking them on as mistresses. Since you have thereby sought enjoyment with them, give them their marriage portions as is stipulated. Yet it will not be held against you should you come to other terms about it even after what has been stipulated. God is Aware, Wise","4:25":"Any of you who cannot afford to marry respectable believing matrons, should then [seek] one of your believing maids under your control. God is quite Aware as to what your faith consists of. Each one of you has ties to others, so marry them off with their family´s consent and give them their marriage portions decently as matrons rather than taking them on as mistresses, nor having [any secret affairs with] them as girlfriends. Once they are so married off and should they then commit some sexual offence, they should have half the punishment that [ordinary] matrons would receive. That goes for any of you who worries lest he may. not control his (sexual] impulses; however it is better for you to discipline yourselves. God is Forgiving, Merciful","4:26":"God wants to explain things to you (all) and to guide you in the customs of those who have preceded you. He turns to you; God is Wise","4:27":"God wants to turn to you, while those who follow their own passions want you to give in utterly","4:28":"God wants to lighten things for you, since man was created weak","4:29":"You who believe, do not use up your wealth idly, [squandering it] on one another, unless it is for some business based on mutual consent among you. Do not kill one another; God has been Merciful towards you","4:30":"We shall roast anyone in a Fire who does so out of enmity and wrongfully. That will be easy for God [to do]","4:31":"If you will avoid the great [sins] you are forbidden [to commit], We will cancel out your [other] evil deeds for you, and send you into [Paradise] through a noble entrance","4:32":"Do not envy the way that God has made some of you excel over others: men should have a portion of whatever they have earned, while women should have a portion of whatever they have earned. Ask God for some of His bounty; God is Aware of everything","4:33":"For everyone We have placed executors for whatever either parents and close relatives may leave. Give their share to those whom you have sworn to trust; God is a Witness of everything","4:34":"Men are the ones who should support women since God has given some persons advantages over others, and because they should spend their wealth [on them]. Honorable women are steadfast, guarding the Unseen just as God has it guarded. Admonish those women whose surliness you fear, and leave them alone in their beds, and [even] beat them [if necessary]. If they obey you, do not seek any way [to proceed] against them. God is Sublime, Great","4:35":"If you fear a split between a man and his wife, send for an arbiter from his family and an arbiter from her family. If both want to be reconciled, God will arrange things between them. God is Aware, Informed","4:36":"Worship God [Alone] and do not associate anything with Him. Show kindness to both [your] parents and with near relatives, orphans, the needy, the neighbor who is related [to you] as well as the neighbor who is a stranger, and your companion by your side and the wayfarer, and anyone else under your control. God does not love someone who is conceited, boastful","4:37":"nor those who are tight-fisted and order [other] people to be stingy, and hide anything that God has given them out of His bounty. We have reserved humiliating torment for disbelievers","4:38":"who spend their wealth to be seen by other people and yet neither believe in God nor the Last Day. Anyone who has Satan for an intimate has such an evil soulmate","4:39":"What does it matter for them whether they believe in God and the Last Day and spend something from what God has supplied them with? God is Aware of them","4:40":"God does not harm anything so much as an atom´s weight: if a fine deed exists, he multiplies it and adds a splendid fee from Himself besides","4:41":"How would it be if We were to bring a witness from every nation, and bring you as a witness against such people","4:42":"On that day those who have disbelieved and defied the Messenger would like to have the earth leveled off while they are still [standing] on it! They will not hide anything that happens from God","4:43":"You who believe, do not attempt to pray while you are drunk, until you know what you are saying; nor after a seminal emission - except when traveling along some road-until you take a full bath. If you are ill or on a journey, or one of you has come from the toilet, or has had contact with any women, and you do not find any water, then pick up some wholesome soil and wipe your faces and your hands with it. God is Pardoning, Forgiving","4:44":"Have you not watched those who were given a portion of the Book? They buy up error and want you to lose your Way","4:45":"God is quite Aware as to who your enemies are; God suffices as a Patron, and God suffices as a Supporter","4:46":"Some persons who are Jews lift words out of their context and say: \"We have heard and disobeyed;\" and \"Hear without listening\" or \"Lead us on!\", twisting their tongues around and stabbing at religion as if they had [really] said: \"We have heard and obeyed,\" and \"Hear!\" and \"Watch over us!\", which would be better for them and more straightforward; however God has cursed them for their disbelief, since only a few believe","4:47":"You who have received the Book, believe in what We have sent down to you as a confirmation of what you already have, lest We dazzle your faces and set them on backwards, or curse them just as We cursed the masters of the Sabbath. God´s command must be fulfilled","4:48":"God does not forgive anyone for associating something with Him, while He does forgive whomever He wishes to for anything besides that. Anyone who gives God associates has invented such an awful offence","4:49":"Have you not seen those who purify themselves? Indeed God will purify anyone He wishes to, and they will not be harmed one bit","4:50":"Look how they invent a lie about God! That is enough in itself as a clear offence","4:51":"Have you not watched those who were given a portion of the Book? They believe in witchcraft and arrogant leaders and tell those who disbelieve: \"Those are better guided to a way than are the ones who believe","4:52":"Those are the ones whom God has cursed; anyone God has cursed will never find a supporter for himself","4:53":"Or have they any share in control? Why, they will not give a speck to anybody","4:54":"Or do they envy people because of what God has given them out of His bounty? We already gave Abraham´s family the Book and wisdom, and We gave them splendid control","4:55":"Some of them believed in it while others of them blocked it out. Hell will suffice as a blaze","4:56":"Those who disbelieve in Our signs We will roast in a Fire: each time their hides are toasted, We shall exchange them for some other skins so they may taste the torment [again]. God is Powerful, Wise","4:57":"We will show those who believe and perform honorable actions into gardens through which rivers flow, to live there forever; they will have clean-living spouses there, and We will show them into shady nooks","4:58":"God orders you to restore deposits entrusted [to you] to their [rightful] owners. Whenever you judge between people, you should judge with [a sense of] justice. How superbly God instructs you to do so; God is Alert, Observant","4:59":"You who believe, obey God and obey the Messenger and those from among you who hold command. If you should quarrel over anything, refer it to God and the Messenger if you believe in God and the Last Day; that will be better, and finer in the long run","4:60":"Have you not considered those who claim they believe in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down before you? They want to seek judgment from arrogant leaders and so they are ordered to disbelieve in it. Satan wants to lead them far astray","4:61":"Whenever someone tells them: \"Come to what God has sent down, and to the Messenger,\" you will see hypocrites barring the way for you","4:62":"How will it be when some disaster strikes them because of what their hands have already prepared? Then they will come to you swearing by God: \"We only wanted to have kindness and success","4:63":"Those are the ones whom God knows what their hearts contain, so shun them and reprove them. Give them a convincing statement about themselves","4:64":"We have not sent any messenger unless he was to be obeyed in accordance with God´s permission. If they had come to you and sought forgiveness from God whenever they harmed themselves, and the Messenger had prayed for forgiveness for them, they would have found that God is Ever-Turning, Merciful","4:65":"Yet by your Lord, they will never believe until they name you to judge concerning what they are quarreling over among themselves; then they will find no inconvenience for themselves concerning whatever you have decided, and will accept it wholeheartedly","4:66":"If We had prescribed for them: ´Let yourselves be killed or expelled from your homes,\" only a few of them would have done so. If they had done what they were instructed to do, it would have been better for them, as well as more stabilizing","4:67":"then We would have given them splendid earnings from Our very presence","4:68":"and guided them to a Straight Road","4:69":"Anyone who obeys God and the Messenger stands by those whom God has favored, such as prophets, loyal persons, martyrs and honorable men. How fine are such companions","4:70":"That means bounty from God; it is enough for God to be Aware","4:71":"You who believe, take your precautions and march off in detachments, or march off all together","4:72":"Among you there are some who procrastinate. If any disaster strikes you, they say: \"God has favored me, for I was not a witness along with them","4:73":"Yet if some bounty from God strikes you, he will say, as if no affection had existed between you and him: \"If only I had been with them, I should have achieved something splendid","4:74":"Let those who barter worldly life for the Hereafter fight for God´s sake; We shall pay a splendid fee to anyone who fights in God´s way, and is either killed or is victorious","4:75":"Why should you not fight for God´s sake when men, women and children who are considered helpless say: \"Our Lord, lead us out of this town whose people are so oppressive, and grant us a patron from Your presence and grant us a supporter from Your presence","4:76":"Those who believe, fight in God´s way, while those who disbelieve fight in the way of the arrogant ones; therefore fight Satan´s patrons. Satan´s plot is weak","4:77":"Have you not watched those who have been told: \"Restrain your hands, keep up prayer and pay the welfare tax\"? Yet whenever any fighting is prescribed for them, then a group of them feel afraid of people just as they should be afraid of God, or they are even more afraid. They say: \"Our Lord, why have You prescribed fighting for us? If You would only postpone it for a little while longer!\" * SAY: \"Worldly enjoyment means little while the Hereafter is better for anyone who does his duty. You will not be wronged a bit","4:78":"Wherever you may be, death shall still overtake you even though you are in well-built towers.\" Yet if something fine happens to them, they say: \"This is from God;\" while if something bad happens to them, they say: \"This is because of you!\" SAY: \"Everything comes from God.\" What is wrong with such folk that they scarcely understand why anything happens","4:79":"Any good that happens to you comes from God, while anything bad that happens to you is through yourself. We have sent you as a Messenger to [instruct] mankind; and God suffices as a Witness","4:80":"Anyone who obeys the Messenger has obeyed God [Himself], while We have not sent you to be a taskmaster set up over anyone who turns away","4:81":"They will say: \"At your orders!\", yet when they show up somewhere else than with you, a faction of them will spend the night at something quite different from what you tell [them to do]. God writes down whatever they do at night, so avoid them and rely on God. God suffices as a Trustee","4:82":"Have they not meditated on the Reading? If it had come from some other source than God, they would have found a great deal of contradiction in it","4:83":"Whenever some order concerning [public] safety or fear comes to them, they broadcast it. If they would only refer it to the Messenger and those among them who hold command, those of them who investigate matters would have known about it. If it had not been for God´s bounty and mercy towards you, all but a few would have followed Satan","4:84":"so fight for God´s sake, since you are only held responsible for yourself. Encourage believers; perhaps God will fend off the violence of those who disbelieve. God is Strongest when things come to violence and Sternest in punishment","4:85":"Anyone who intercedes in a fine manner shall have a share in it, while someone who intercedes in an evil way will be held liable for it. God is a Developer for everything","4:86":"Whenever you are welcomed with some greeting, then answer back with something finer than it, or [at least] return it. God is a Reckoner for everything","4:87":"God, there is no deity except Him. He will bring you all together Resurrection Day there is no doubt about it. Who is more reliable than God as a Narrator","4:88":"Why should you take both sides concerning hypocrites? God has discarded them because of what they have earned. Do you want to guide someone whom God has let go astray? Anyone whom God lets go astray will never find a way back to Him","4:89":"They would love for you disbelieve just as they disbelieve, so you will be exactly like them. Do not adopt sponsors from among them until they migrate along God´s way. If they should ever turn against you, then seize them and kill them wherever you may find them. Do not adopt any sponsor nor supporter from among them","4:90":"except those who join a folk with who you have a treaty or who come to you because their breasts shrink from fighting you or fighting with their own people. If God so wished, He would have given them authority over you so that they would have fought you. Yet if they keep aloof from you and do not fight you, and they propose peace to you, God does not grant you any way against them","4:91":"You will find others who want to feel safe from you as well as safe from their own people, yet every time they come upon another chance for dissension, they plunge into it. If they neither keep aloof from you nor yet propose peace to you and hold back their hands, then take them and sly them wherever you may run across them. Over such persons We have given you clear authority","4:92":"No believer should kill any other believer unless it happens by mistake. Anyone who kills a believer by mistake should free believing captive and deliver blood-money to his family unless they forego it as an act of charity. If he was from a nation which is at war with you and yet he was a believer, then free a believing captive; while if he were from a people with whom you have a treaty, then it means blood-money should be delivered to his family and freeing a believing captive. Anyone who does not find the wherewithal for it should fast for two consecutive months as penance from God. God is Aware, Wise","4:93":"Anyone who kills a believer deliberately will receive as his reward [a sentence] to live in Hell for ever. God will be Angry with him and curse him, and prepare dreadful torment for him","4:94":"You who believe, whenever you campaign for God´s sake, discriminate carefully and do not tell someone who proffers you a greeting: ´You are no believer!\" You crave the display of worldly life, while God holds many more prizes. That is what you were like previously, though God has showered His benefits on you; so discriminate. God is Informed about anything you do","4:95":"Those believers who sit around and yet have no physical disability are not equal to those who strive for God´s sake with their property and persons. God shows preference to those who strive with their property and persons through [higher] rank, than with those who just sit around; for each, God has promised handsome things, yet God shows preference to strivers with a better wage over those who stay at home","4:96":"such as [higher] ranks from Him, as well as forgiveness and mercy. God is Forgiving, Merciful","4:97":"Those whom the angels will gather up [and] tell, as they are harming themselves: \"What were you [busy] with?\", will say: \"We were acting as weaklings on earth.\" They will say: ´Is not God´s earth so vast you might settle down elsewhere on it?\" Those will have their refuge in Hell, and how evil is such a goal","4:98":"except for those men, women and children who are [really] helpless and cannot find any other means nor a they guided in any way","4:99":"those God may eventually pardon. God is Pardoning, Forgiving","4:100":"Anyone who migrates for God´s sake will find many places for asylum and accommodation on earth.

Disbelievers are open enemies of yours","4:102":"When you are among them, [Muhammad], and have stood up to pray in front of them, then let a squad of them stand up along with you and hold on to their weapons. Once they have bowed down on their knees then let them fall back to your rear, and another squad who have not yet prayed come up to pray along with you. Let them hold on to [both] their precautions and their weapons. Those who disbelieve would like to catch you napping with your weapons and your baggage, so they may overpower you (all) at one stroke. Nor will it be held against you if you are bothered by rain or are ill should you lay down your weapons and take [similar] precautions for yourselves. God has prepared humiliating torment for disbelievers","4:103":"Once you have finished praying, remember God while standing, sitting and [lying] on your sides. Even when you are at leisure, still keep up prayer: Prayer is a timely prescription for believers","4:104":"Yet do not flag in pursuit of people: if you have been suffering, then they are suffering just as keenly as you are suffering; while you expect something from God that they do not expect.

We yearn for our Lord to admit us along with honorable folk","5:85":"God will compensate them with gardens through which rivers flow to live in forever because of what they have said. Such will be the reward of those who act kindly","5:86":"while those who disbelieve and reject Our signs will become the inmates of Hades","5:87":"You who believe, do not forbid any wholesome things which God has permitted you, nor exceed the limits. God does not love the defiant","5:88":"Eat any lawful, wholesome thing which God has provided you with. Heed God in Whom you are believers","5:89":"God will not take you to task for what you may rattle off in your oaths, but He does take you to task for anything you have sworn to solemnly [and then ignored]. Exoneration for it means feeding ten paupers with the average of what you would feed your own families, or clothing them, or freeing a captive. Whoever does not find the wherewithal [to do so], should fast for three days. This is what penance involves in order to free yourselves from any oath you have sworn [loosely]. Keep your word; thus God explains His signs to you, so you may act grateful","5:90":"You who believe, liquor and gambling, idols and raffles, are only the filthy work of Satan; turn aside from it so that you may prosper","5:91":"Satan only wants to stir up enmity and jealousy among you by means of liquor and gambling, and to hinder you from remembering God and from praying. So will you stop","5:92":"Obey God and obey the Messenger, and be on your guard. If you should ever turn away, know that Our messenger need only state thing clearly","5:93":"It will not be held against those who believe and perform honorable deeds for what they may have fed on while they did not do their duty, since they did believe and performed honorable deeds. So do you duty and believe-and then again, do your duty and act kindly: God loves those who act kindly","5:94":"You who believe, God will test you by means of some of the game which your hands and spears have caught, so that God may know who fears Him even though [He is] Unseen. Anyone who acts defiant later on, will have painful torment","5:95":"You who believe, do not kill any game while you are forbidden [this while on Pilgrimage]. Anyone of you who kills some deliberately may make compensation through the same [type of animal] as he has killed, in livestock, with two fair-minded men from among you judging it, which should be sent as an offering to reach the Kaba; or else exoneration may mean feeding paupers or the equivalent of that in fasting, so that he may taste the effect of his action. God pardons whatever is a thing of the past. God will avenge Himself on anyone who does so over again; God is Powerful, the Wielder of Retribution","5:96":"Game from the sea is lawful for you; eating it means provision for you as well as for travellers. Game from land is forbidden you so long as you are under taboo [on Pilgrimage]. Heed God, before Whom you will be summoned","5:97":"God has placed the Kaba as the Hallowed House to be maintained for mankind, as well as the Hallowed Month and the offerings and garlands; that is so you may know that God knows whatever is in Heaven and whatever is on Earth, and that God is Aware of everything","5:98":"Know that God is Stern in punishment and (also) that God is Forgiving Merciful","5:99":"The Messenger has only to proclaim matters; while God knows whatever you show and whatever you hide","5:100":"SAY: \"Evil and good are not equal, even though the abundance of evil may fascinate you; so heed God, you prudent persons, so that you may prosper","5:101":"You who believe, do not ask about such things as would worry you if they were shown to you. Yet if you should ask about them while the Quran is being sent down, they will be explained to you. God pardons it, for God is Forgiving, Lenient","5:102":"A folk before you asked about them; then became disbelievers because of it","5:103":"God has not set up [especially] any slit-eared camel, nor is any [livestock] to be turned loose [to pasture freely], nor any twin-bearing goat or ewe nor any pensioned stallion, but rather those who disbelieve make up a lie about God. Most of them do not use their reason","5:104":"Whenever they are told: \"Come to what God has sent down, and to [hear] the Messenger,\" they say: ´We are satisfied with what we found our forefathers doing;\" even though their forefathers did not know anything and were not guided","5:105":"You who believe, your souls are in your own care. No one who goes astray will harm you, provided you are guided. Toward God will you all return together, and He will notify you about whatever you have doing","5:106":"You who believe, testimony should be taken by you whenever death appears for one of you; at the time for drawing up any will, two of you who are fair-minded, or two others besides yourselves if you are travelling around the earth and the calamity of death should strike you. Detain them both after prayer so they may swear by God if you (all) have any doubts \"We will not sell it for any price, not even to a near relative, nor will we hide God´s testimony: otherwise we would be sinners","5:107":"If it turns out that either of them has been accused of any sin, then let two others than the first two from among those who deserve to be [executors] stand up in their stead. Let them both swear by God: \"Our testimony is more valid than the testimony by either of them; we have never defied [God] for then we would be wrongdoers","5:108":"That is more appropriate for you in order to secure testimony at its face value, or for them to fear you may check back by means of [fresh] oaths following their own oaths [now]. Heed God and listen; God does not guide immoral folk","5:109":"Someday God will assemble [His] messengers and say: \"What response have you received?\" They will say: \"We possess no knowledge; You are the Knower of Unseen things","5:110":"So God will say: ´Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favor towards you and towards your mother when I assisted you with the Holy Spirit. You spoke to people from the cradle and as an adult when I taught you the Book and wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel. So you created something out of clay looking like a bird with my permission; you breathed into it, and by My permission it became a bird! You cured anyone born blind, and the leper with My permission. So you brought forth the dead by My permission, and I fended off the Children of Israel from you, when you brought them explanations, so those among them who disbelieved said: ´This is sheer magic!´","5:111":"When I inspired the disciples to believe in Me and in My messenger, they said: ´We believe, so take witness that we are Muslims.´","5:112":"When the disciples said: ´Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord send a Table down from Heaven for us?, he said: ´Heed God if you are believers!´","5:113":"They said: ´We want to eat from it, and for our hearts to feet at rest, and so we know that you have told us the Truth, and that we should be witnesses for it.´","5:114":"Jesus the son of Mary said: ´O God our Lord, send us down a Table from Heaven so it may be a recurring feast for us, for both the first of us and the last of us, and as a sign from You! Provide for us, since you are the best Provider.´","5:115":"God said: ´I shall send it down to you. Any of you who disbelieves afterward, I shall punish with such torment as I have never punished anyone in the Universe!\"´","5:116":"When God said: ´Jesus, son of Mary, have you told people: \"Take me and my mother as two gods instead of God [Alone]?´;\" he said: \"Glory be to You! It is not my place to say what I have no right to [say]. If I had said it, You would have known it already: You know what is on my mind, while I do not know anything that is on Yours. You are the Knower of Unseen things","5:117":"I have never told them anything except what You have ordered me to: ´Worship God as my Lord and your Lord.´ I was a witness for them so long as I was among them. When You have gathered me up, You became the Watcher over them; You are a Witness for everything","5:118":"If you should punish them, they are still Your servants; while if You should forgive them, surely You are Powerful, Wise","5:119":"God said: \"This is a day when their truthfulness will benefit the truthful: they shall have gardens through which rivers flow, to live in ever and ever.\" God approves of them, while they are pleased with Him; that will be the supreme Achievement","5:120":"God holds control over Heaven and Earth, as well as whatever lies within them. He is capable of everything","6:1":"Praise be to God, Who created Heaven and Earth and granted darkness and light! Yet those who disbelieve make other things equal to their Lord","6:2":"He is the One Who has created you (all) from clay; then fixed a term. A deadline has been set by Him, yet you go on doubting","6:3":"He is God in (both) Heaven and Earth. He knows your secrets and anything you publish; He knows whatever you earn","6:4":"Not one of their Lord´s signs ever reaches them except they shun it","6:5":"They have rejected Truth whenever it came to them, yet (more) news will reach them concerning what they have been making fun of","6:6":"Have they not seen how many generations We wiped out whom we had established on earth before them in a way We did not establish you? We sent [water down from] the sky upon them in torrents and let rivers flow beneath them; and yet We wiped them out because of their offences and raised up other generations to succeed them","6:7":"Even though We sent you down something written on a papyrus scroll so they might touch it with their own hands, those who would still say: \"This is just sheer magic!´","6:8":"They say: \"If an angel only sent down to him!\" Yte if We were to send an angel down, the matter would be settled; then they would no longer be allowed to wait","6:9":"Yet if We were to send an angel down, the matter would be settled; then they would no longer be allowed to wait. We made him into an angel, We would have made him a man a swell, to confuse them just as they confuse themselves","6:10":"Messengers have been scoffed at before you, till whatever they were ridiculing swept in around those who had been doing the scoffing","6:11":"SAY: \"Travel around the earth and see what the outcome was for those who denied [it all]","6:12":"SAY: \"Who owns whatever is in Heaven and Earth?\" SAY: \"God does. He has prescribed mercy for Himself so He may gather you in on Resurrection Day, concerning which there is no doubt. Yet those who have lost their souls will never believe","6:13":"He has anything that rests at night and by daylight. He is the Alert, Aware","6:14":"SAY: \"Shall I adopt someone as a patron besides God, the Deviser of the Heavens and Earth? He feeds [everybody], yet is not fed!\" SAY: \"I have been ordered to be the first who has committed himself to (live at) peace. Do not be an associator","6:15":"SAY: \"I fear the torment of an awful day if I should disobey my Lord","6:16":"He will show mercy to anyone who is spared on that day: that will be the clear Triumph","6:17":"If God should let any harm touch you, no one would remove it except He Himself; while if He should let some good touch you, well He is Capable of everything","6:18":"He is the Irresistible, [High] above His servants. He is the Wise, the Informed","6:19":"SAY: \"What thing is most important as evidence?\" SAY: \"God is a Witness for both me and you.

Wrongdoers will never prosper","6:22":"Some day We will summon them all together, then tell those who have associated [others with Us]: ´Where are your associates which you have been claiming [to have]","6:23":"Then there will be no test for them unless they say: \"By God our Lord, we have not been associators","6:24":"See how they lie even about themselves! Whatever they have invented has misled them","6:25":"Some of them listen to you even though We have placed wrappings over their hearts and dullness in their ears lest they should understand it. Even if they saw every sign, they still would not believe in them; so whenever they come to you, they argue with you. Those who disbelieve say: ´These are only legends by primitive people","6:26":"They try to refute it and remain aloof from it; yet they only destroy their own souls while they do not even notice it","6:27":"If you could see when they are set before the Fire and say: \"Alas, if we might only be sent back and had not rejected our Lord´s signs, and we had been believers","6:28":"Rather what they had been hiding previously has appeared to them; even though they were sent back, they would still return to what they have been forbidden. They are such liars","6:29":"They say: \"Only our worldly life exists; we will not be raised up again","6:30":"If you could only see as they are made to stand before their Lord!

Is not whatever they bear something evil","6:32":"What does worldly life mean except some sport and amusement? The future Home is better for those who do their duty. Will you (all) not use your reason","6:33":"We well know how anything they say saddens you. Yet they are not rejecting merely you, but wrongdoers even repudiate God´s signs","6:34":"Messengers before you have been rejected, yet they held firm on being rejected and abused, until Our support came to them. There is no way to change God´s words! News from (other) emissaries has already come to you","6:35":"If their reluctance bears so heavily upon you, then how would it be if you managed to bore a tunnel through the earth or to climb a ladder up to Heaven, and brought a sign to them? If God so wished, He would gather them together for guidance; so do not act so ignorant as well","6:36":"Only those who listen will respond, plus the dead whom God will raise; then unto Him will they return","6:37":"They say: \"If a sign were only sent down to him by his Lord!\" SAY: \"God is Able to send down a sign, even though most of them will not know it","6:38":"There is no animal [walking] on earth nor any bird flying on its wings unless they exist as communities like yourselves. We have not neglected anything in the Book; then to their Lord will they be summoned","6:39":"Those who reject Our signs are deaf and dumb, [groping along] in darkness.

Praise be to God, Lord of the Universe","6:46":"SAY: \"Have you (all) considered whether, if God should snatch away your hearing and your eyesight, and sealed off your hearts, who is the god besides God [Himself] who can give them back to you?\" Watch how We deal out signs, yet they still keep aloof","6:47":"SAY: \"Have you yourselves considered whether, if God´s torment should come to you suddenly or openly, any except wrong-doing folk would be wiped out","6:48":"We do not send any emissaries except as newsbearers and warners. Anyone who believes and reforms should have no fear nor will they be saddened","6:49":"while punishment will alight on those who reject Our signs because how of immoral they have been","6:50":"SAY: \"I do not say God´s treasures lie with me nor do I know the Unseen, nor do I even tell you I am an angel. I merely follow what has been inspired in me.\" SAY: \"Are the blind and the sighted man equal?

You have nothing to do with their reckoning, while they have nothing to do with your reckoning. Should you drive them off, you would be a wrongdoer","6:53":"Even so do We try some of them by means of others, so they may say: \"Are those the ones among us towards whom God has been gracious? Is God not quite Aware as to who are grateful","6:54":"Whenever those who believe in Our signs come to you, SAY: \"Peace be upon you!\" Your Lord has prescribed mercy for Himself so He will be Forgiving, Merciful to any of you who commits evil out of ignorance, then repents later on and reforms","6:55":"Thus We spell out signs so the criminals´ way may be evident","6:56":"SAY: \"I am forbidden to serve those whom you appeal to instead of to God.\" SAY: \"I do not follow your whims: in that case I would go astray and not be guided","6:57":"SAY: \"I am [looking] for evidence from my Lord while you have rejected it. I do not have what you are trying to hurry up; discretion lies only with God.

He is the Swiftest Reckoner","6:63":"SAY: \"Who saves you from darkness on land and at sea?\" You appeal to Him beseeching and in secret: \"If He will rescue us from this, we´ll be so grateful","6:64":"SAY: \"God will rescue you from it, and from all anxiety. Yet you still associate others with Him","6:65":"SAY: \"He is Able to send torment down upon you or from underneath your feet, or to confuse you with factions and make some of you experience the violence of others.\" Watch how We handle signs so that they may understand","6:66":"Even so our folk reject it although it is the Truth. SAY: ´I am no administrator set up over you","6:67":"Every piece of news has some purpose, as you shall realize","6:68":"Whenever you see those who speculate about Our signs, avoid them till they speculate about some other topic of conversation. Even if Satan should cause you to forget [to do so], still do not sit around with such wrongful folk once you remember","6:69":"Those who do their duty are not accountable for them in any way except to remind [them], so that they [in turn] may do their duty","6:70":"Stay away from those who take their religion as a sport and amusement. Worldly life has lured them on. Remind [them] of it lest any soul become reckless because of what he has earned; he will have no patron nor any other intercessor besides God.

God does not guide such immoral folk","9:25":"God has supported you on many battlefields and the day of Hunayn when our own numbers amazed you; yet it did not spare you in any way and the earth seemed cramped for you, spacious as it is. Then you fell back in retreat","9:26":"Next God sent His serenity down upon His messenger and on believers; He sent down armies you did not even see and punished those who disbelieved. Such is the reward for disbelievers","9:27":"Then later on God will turn towards anyone He wishes. God is Forgiving, Merciful","9:28":"You who believe, associators are nothing but filthy, so they should not approach the Hallowed Mosque after this year that they still have.

Know that God stands by the heedful","9:37":"Postponing it will only [lead to] an increase in [their] disbelief. those who disbelieve are led astray by it; they permit it one year and ban it another year so they make up for any number that God has forbidden and (even) permit something God has forbidden. Their evil actions seem attractive to them, although God does not guide disbelieving folk","9:38":"You who believe, what is wrong with you when you are told: ´March off in God´s cause!\"? Do you feel weighted down to the ground? Are you more satisfied with worldly life than with the [prospect of the] Hereafter?

Hell will engulf dis-believers","9:50":"If some fine thing happens to you, it bothers them, while misfortune happens to you, they say: ´We already took our matter in had previously.\" They stalk away rejoicing","9:51":"SAY: \"Nothing will ever happen to us unless God has prescribed it.\" He is our Protector, and on God [Alone] should believers rely","9:52":"SAY: \"Are you expecting only one of our two fine things for us, while we are expecting you to have God afflict you with torment from His very presence or at our hands? So wait around we are waiting along with you","9:53":"SAY: \"Spend either willingly or unwillingly, it will never be accepted from you, since you have been such immoral folk","9:54":"The reason that prevents them from having their expenditures accepted from them is merely that they have disbelieved in God and His messenger and do not come to pray except when they are lazy, nor do they spend anything [on charity or taxes] unless they are reluctant","9:55":"Do not let their wealth nor children astonish you; God only wants to punish them by means of them during worldly life and for their souls to perish while they are disbelievers","9:56":"They swear by God that they are with you while they do not stand with you, but are a folk who are easily scared off","9:57":"If they should find some refuge or some caverns, or an entrance they could creep into, they would bolt away","9:58":"Some of them criticize you concerning the [distribution of] charity.

Yet approval by God is test; that will be the supreme Achievement","9:73":"Prophet, struggle with disbelievers and hypocrites; deal harshly with them: their lodging will be Hell, and how awful is such a destination","9:74":"They swear by God they have said nothing while they did pronounce the word of disbelief, they disbelieve after their commitment to [live in] peace; and worry over what they do not accomplish. How spitefully they act merely because God and His messenger have enriched them out of His bounty.

You were someone quite unaware previously","12:4":"So Joseph told his father: \"My father, I saw eleven stars, and the sun and moon; I saw them bowing down before me","12:5":"He said: \"My dear son, do not relate your vision to your brothers lest they may lay some trap for you; Satan is an open enemy to man","12:6":"Thus your Lord is choosing you and teaching you how to interpret events, and completing His favor towards you and Jacob´s house, just as He has already completed it towards both your forefathers Abraham and Isaac. Your Lord is Aware, Wise","12:7":"There were signs for inquirers in Joseph and his brothers","12:8":"when they said; \"Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, even though we are a closed group. Our father is clearly mistaken","12:9":"[Let´s] kill Joseph or throw him into exile in some land so your father´s attention will be absorbed in (all of) you, and later on you will be honorable folk","12:10":"One among them spoke up and said: \"Don´t kill Joseph; toss him into the bottom of the cistern so some travellers may pick him up, if you must do something","12:11":"They said: \"Our father, what´s wrong with you that you do not trust us with Joseph? We are quite sincere about him","12:12":"Send him along with us tomorrow to relax and play. We´ll look after him","12:13":"He said: \"It would worry me for you to go off with him. I fear a wolf will eat him up while you are careless about him","12:14":"They said: \"How could a wolf eat him when we are a closed group? Then we would be losers","12:15":"As they went away with him, they agreed on how to place him in the bottom of a cistern. We inspired him as follows: \"You will inform them about this business of theirs while they will not catch on about it","12:16":"They came back weeping to their father in the evening","12:17":"They said: \"Our father, we went off racing and left Joseph with our belongings, and the wolf ate him up! You will not believe us even though we are telling the truth","12:18":"They even came with false blood on his shirt. He said: \"Rather you yourselves have been fooled in the matter. Patience is beautiful! God is the One to seek help from against what you describe","12:19":"Some travellers came along who sent their waterboy and he let do his own bucket. He said: \"What a godsend! This is a boy!\" So they hid him as a piece of merchandise; yet God was Aware of what they were doing","12:20":"They sold him for a trifling price, just a few coins which were counted out. They were quite indifferent about him","12:21":"The person from Egypt who [eventually] bought him told his wife: ´Let his stay here be dignified; perhaps he will benefit us or we´ll adopt him as a son.\" Thus We established Joseph in the land and taught him how to interpret events. God was Dominant in his affair, even though most men do not realize it","12:22":"When he became of age, We gave him discretion and knowledge; thus We reward those who act kindly","12:23":"However the woman in whose house he lived, wanted to seduce him. She bolted the doors and said: Come here, you!\" He said: \"God protect me! He is my Lord, the best shelter to hold on by. He does not let wrongdoers prosper.´","12:24":"She kept him on her mind, while he would have had her on his, had it not been that he saw a proof from his Lord. Thus We warded off evil and sexual misconduct from him; he was one of Our sincere servants","12:25":"They both raced for the door, and she ripped his shirt from behind; and they met her husband at the door! She said: \"What is the penalty for someone who wants [to commit] evil with your wife except for him to be jailed or [suffer] painful torment","12:26":"He said: \"She tried to seduce me.\" A witness from her side of the family testified: \"If his shirt has been ripped from in front, then she has told the truth and he is a liar","12:27":"while if his shirt has been ripped from behind, then she has lied and he is truthful","12:28":"When he saw his shirt was ripped from behind, he said: \"It is one of your women´s tricks. Your wiles are serious","12:29":"Joseph, avoid this. [My wife], ask forgiveness for your sin. You´re someone who has slipped up","12:30":"Some women in the city said: \"The official´s wife wants to seduce her houseboy. He´s set her madly in love! We see she has gone clear astray","12:31":"When she heard about their remarks, she sent for them and prepared a party for them. To each of them she gave a knife. She told [him]: \"Come out to [see] them!\" When they saw him, they praised him and cut their hands. They said: \"God forbid! This is no human being; this is simply a noble angel!´","12:32":"She said: \"Well this is the person whom you blamed me for. Yes, I wanted to seduce him, and he held himself back! If he doesn´t do what I order him to, he´ll be jailed, and taken down a notch or two","12:33":"He said: \"My Lord, jail is more precious to me than what they are inviting me to do. Unless You ward off their tricks from me, I´ll fall for them and act as if I do not know a thing","12:34":"His Lord responded to his plea and warded off their tricks from him. He is the Alert, Aware","12:35":"Then it occurred to them to jail him for a while even after they had seen the signs","12:36":"Two young men entered the prison along with him. One of the said: \"I dreamed I was pressing wine.\" The other said: \"I dreamed I was carrying bread on my head from which the birds were eating. Tell us about their interpretation; we see you are someone who acts kindly","12:37":"He said: \"Food will not be brought either of you to sustain you, unless I will tell you their interpretation even before it reaches you. That is something my Lord has taught me. I have left the sect of folk who do not believe in God and are disbelievers in the Hereafter","12:38":"I follow the sect my forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. We may not associate anything in [our worship of] God [Alone]. That is part of God´s bounty towards us and towards mankind; even though most men are not grateful","12:39":"Both my jailmates, are separate lords better than God Alone, the Irresistible","12:40":"Instead of Him you do not serve anything except some names which you and your forefathers have given them. God has not sent down any authority for them. Discretion belongs only to God. He has ordered you to serve Him Alone; such is the established religion, even though most men do not realize it","12:41":"My two jailmates, one of you will pour wine for his lord, while the other will be crucified so birds will eat from his head. The case has been decided which you have been seeking my opinion about","12:42":"He told the one whom he thought would be released: \"Mention me to your lord.\" However Satan made him forget to mention it to his lord, he languished in jail for several years","12:43":"The king said; \"I [dreamed I] saw seven fat cows which seven lean ones were eating, and seven green ears plus some others all dried up. Councilmen, explain my dream to me if you know how to explain any vision","12:44":"They said: \"Jumbles of dreams; we do not know how to interpret dreams","12:45":"The one from the pair who had been released said (for he recalled things after a lapse of time): \"I´ll inform you about it interpretation. Send me [after it]","12:46":"Joseph, you truthful man, explain to us about seven fat cows which seven lean ones were eating, and seven green ears and others all dried up, so that I may return to the people so they may know","12:47":"He said: \"You will farm for seven years as usual, and with anything you harvest, leave it in its ear except for a little which you may eat","12:48":"The later on, seven severe ones will come which will eat up anything you have planned ahead for them, except for a little which you will store up","12:49":"Then a year will come after that when people will receive showers, and in which they will press [grapes]","12:50":"The king said: \"Bring him to me.\" When the messenger came to him, he said: \"Return to your lord and ask him what [was on] the mind of the women who cut their hands. My Lord is Aware of their tricks.´","12:51":"He said: \"What were you after when you tried to seduce Joseph? The women said: \"God forbid! We have not known about any evil concerning him.\" The official´s wife said: \"Now the Truth has prevailed! I tried to seduce him; he is someone who is telling the truth","12:52":"That was so he may know that I have not betrayed him during his absence, and that God does not guide traitors","12:53":"´I do not claim to be innocent myself. one´s soul is prone to [commit] evil, except for anything my Lord shows mercy for. My Lord is Forgiving, Merciful","12:54":"The king said: \"Bring him to me; I´ll select him for my special service. \"When he spoke to him, he said: \"Today you stand before us secure, trusted","12:55":"He said: \"Place me over the storehouses in the land. I will be a careful overseer","12:56":"Thus We established Joseph in the land, to budget for it in any way he wished. We confer Our mercy on anyone We wish to and never let the earnings of those who act kindly get lost","12:57":"Earnings in the Hereafter will be even better for those who believe and have done their duty","12:58":"Joseph´s brothers came, and they entered his office. He recognized them, while they remained ignorant as to who he was","12:59":"When he had equipped them with their supplies, he said: \"Bring me a brother of yours [who is] with your father. Don´t you see that I give full measure and have been the best of hosts","12:60":"If you do not bring me him, I´ll have no [further] measure for you nor need you ever approach me [again]","12:61":"They said: \"We´ll try to coax his father to let him go, We [promise] to do so","12:62":"He told his houseboys: \"Place their trading goods back in their saddlebags, so they will recognize it when they return home to their family; thus they may come back","12:63":"When they returned to their father, they said: \"Our father [further] measure has been denied us, so send our brother [Benjamin] along with us so we may be treated as customers. We´ll look after him","12:64":"He said: \"How dare I trust you with him except as I entrusted you with his brother long ago? God is the best Guardian and the most Merciful of Mercy-granters","12:65":"When they opened their baggage, they found their trading goods had been returned to them. They said: \"Our father, what more do we desire than this? This merchandise of ours has been returned to us! We shall supply our family, look after our brother, and add a camel´s load [to it] besides: that should be such an easy load","12:66":"He said: ´I will never send him with you until you give me some assurance before God that you will bring him back to me, unless you have been ambushed.\" When they had given him their pledge, he said: \"God is a Trustee for what we say","12:67":"He said: \"My sons, do not enter by a single gate; enter rather by separate gates. I cannot help you in any way against God; discretion rests only with God. On Him have I relied, and on Him should reliant persons rely","12:68":"When they had entered [the city] just as their father ordered them to, it did not help them in any way against God except as a need which He fulfilled in Jacob´s soul. He possessed knowledge since We had taught him, although most men do not realize it","12:69":"As they entered Joseph´s quarters, he took his brother [Benjamin] aside. He said: \"I am your brother, so do not feel distressed about whatever they have been doing","12:70":"When he furnished them with their supplies, he placed a mug in his brother´s saddlebag. Then a crier called out: \"Caravaners, you are thieves","12:71":"They said as they approached them: \"What have you lost","12:72":"They said: \"We are missing the king´s goblet. Whoever brings it back will have a camel´s load; I can vouch for it","12:73":"They said: \"By God, you [ought to] know we have not come here to cause any trouble in the land. We are not thieves","12:74":"They said: \"What will the penalty be for it if you are liars","12:75":"They said: \"Its penalty? Whoever´s saddlebag it is found in will [act as] his own penalty. Thus we penalize wrongdoers","12:76":"He began with their baggage before his brother´s bag. Then he pulled it out of his brother [Benjamin]´s bag. Thus We contrived [things] for Joseph; he would never have taken his brother according to the king´s code unless God had so wished it. We raise anyone We wish to in rank, while Someone Aware [stands] over everyone possessing knowledge","12:77":"They said: \"If he has been [caught] stealing, then a brother of his stole something previously.\" Joseph kept his secret to himself and did not reveal it to them. He said: \"You are in a worse plight! God is quite Aware of what you describe","12:78":"They said: \"Sir, he has a father who is an elderly gentleman. Take one of us in his place; we see you are someone who acts kindly","12:79":"He said: \"God prevent us from taking anyone except the one whom we found our property with! We´d then be wrongdoers","12:80":"When they despaired of influencing him, they held counsel by themselves. The eldest of them said: \"Don´t you realize that your father took a pledge from you before God? You have already been remiss concerning Joseph so I shall never leave the land until my father permits me to, or God decides [things] for me. He is the best Judge","12:81":"Return to your father and say: ´Our father, your son has stolen something! Yet we testify only about what we know and are not guardians of the Unseen","12:82":"Ask the town[sfolk] where we have been and the caravan which we came back in; we are telling the truth!\"´","12:83":"He said: ´Rather you have fooled yourselves in the matter. Patience is a virtue! Perhaps God will bring them all back to me; He is the Aware, the Wise","12:84":"He turned away from them and said: \"How upset I feel over Joseph!\" Both his eyes clouded over from sadness, so he choked back his grief","12:85":"They said: ´By God, you keep on remembering Joseph until you will be exhausted or will be ready to die","12:86":"He said: \"I complain only to God about my sorrow and my sadness. Through God I know something you do not know","12:87":"My sons, go and search for Joseph and his brother; do not despair of [finding] God´s comfort; only disbelieving folk despair of God´s comfort","12:88":"When they entered his office, they said: \"Sir, trouble has afflicted us and our family, and we have come with meager merchandise. Fill up the load for us and act charitably towards us. God rewards the charitable","12:89":"He said: \"Do you know what you did to Joseph and his brother while you were acting out of ignorance","12:90":"They said: \"Why, are you Joseph?\" He said: \"I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God has compensated us; with anyone who does his duty and perseveres, God does not lose track of the wages for those who act kindly","12:91":"They said: \"By God, God has preferred you ahead of us, while we have been mistaken","12:92":"He said: \"There is no [way for me to] find fault with you today. God will forgive you; He is the most Merciful of the Mercy-granting","12:93":"Take this shirt of mine and throw it over my father´s face; he will become sighted [again], Bring me all your family","12:94":"As the caravan set out, their father said: \"I smell a breath from Joseph, even though you may think I am doting","12:95":"They said: \"By God, you are still in your old error","12:96":"When an advance rider came, he threw it over his face, and his sight was restored. He said: \"Did I not tell you that through God I know something that you do not know","12:97":"They said: \"Our father, seek us forgiveness for our offences! We have been mistaken","12:98":"He said: \"I shall seek forgiveness for you from my Lord; He is the Forgiving, the Merciful","12:99":"When they entered Joseph´s office, he took both his parents aside and said: \"Enter Egypt safely, if God wishes","12:100":"He helped his parents up on to the platform, and they fell down on their knees before him. He said: \"My father, this is the interpretation of my earlier vision. My Lord has made it come true! He was Kind to me when He let me out of jail, and brought you in from wandering on the desert after Satan had stirred up trouble between me and my brothers. My Lord is Gracious in whatever way He wishes; He is the Aware, the Wise","12:101":"My lord, you have given me control and taught me how to interpret events. Originator of Heaven and Earth You are my Patron in this world and the Hereafter. Gather me in as a Muslim and unite me with honorable men","12:102":"Such are some of the news from the Unseen We inspire you with. You were not in their presence when they agreed on their affair and were plotting","12:103":"Yet most men will not become believers, no matter how eager you may be","12:104":"You need not ask them for any payment for it; it [serves] only as a Reminder to [everybody in] the Universe","12:105":"How many a sign do they pass by in Heaven and Earth, and pay no attention to them","12:106":"Most of them do not believe in God unless they associate [others with Him]","12:107":"Do they feel confident that a sample of God´s torment may not come to them, or the [final] Hour will come upon them suddenly, while they do not suspect it","12:108":"SAY: \"This is my way. I and anyone who follows me, appeal to God through insight. Glory be to God! I am no associator","12:109":"We have not sent anyone before you except men from among the townspeople whom We have inspired. Have they not travelled around the earth and seen what the outcome was for those who preceded them? A home in the Hereafter will be better for those who do their duty. Will they not use their reason","12:110":"so that once messengers despair and think that they have been lied to, Our support will come to them and anyone We wish to will be saved? Our might is never averted from criminal folk","12:111":"There is a lesson in their stories for prudent persons. It is not some report which has been invented but confirmation of what has existed previously and an analysis of everything, as well as guidance and mercy for folk who believe","13:1":"L. M. R. These are verses from the Book; what has been sent down to you by your Lord is the Truth, even though most men do not believe so","13:2":"God is the One Who has raised up the Heavens without any support you can see. Then He mounted on the Throne and regulated the sun and moon; each runs along on a specific course. He directs the matter; He manifests signs so that you may be convinced about meeting your Lord","13:3":"He is the One Who has spread the earth out and placed headlands and rivers on it, and has placed two pairs for every kind of fruit on it. He wraps daylight up in night. In that are signs for folk who meditate","13:4":"On the earth are neighboring tracts, and vineyards, cultivated fields and datepalms, [growing] in clumps and all alone, watered from a single source. We make some of them excel others in food value. In that are signs for folk who use their reason","13:5":"If you should feel astonished, then how much more astonishing is their statement: \"When we have become dust, shall we [end up] in some fresh creation?\" Those are the ones who disbelieve in their Lord; such (persons) will have fetters [placed] around their necks and those will become inmates of the Fire, to live there forever","13:6":"They want to hasten you on to commit evil rather than [to perform] a fine deed. Examples have already been set before them. Your Lord possesses forgiveness for mankind, no matter how wrong they are; though your Lord still is Stern with punishment","13:7":"Those who disbelieve say: \"If only a sign were sent down from his Lord!\" Yet you are only a warner; each folk has a guide","13:8":"God knows what every female bears, and how some wombs may miscarry or else may wait too long. Everything has its measure with Him","13:9":"Knowing the Unseen and the Visible, [He is] the Great, the Exalted","13:10":"It is all the same for you whether one of you is secretive about what he says or speaks out about it, and whether one keeps to himself night and struts around by day","13:11":"he has [angels] checking from both before him and behind him; they guard him at God´s command.

He whips up the heavy clouds","13:13":"Thunder hymns His praise while angels stand in awe of Him. He sends down thunderbolts and strikes anyone He wishes with them. Yet they argue on and on about God while He is Stern in strategy","13:14":"To Him should go the appeal for Truth; those they appeal to instead of Him will never respond to them in any way, except as someone does who stretches out his palms for water, so it may reach his mouth since he himself can never reach it.

Rather they are in doubt and indeed they are blind concerning it","27:67":"Those who disbelieve say: \"When we and our forefathers have become dust, shall we be brought forth again","27:68":"We and our forefathers were promised this before; these are only legends [made up] by primitive men","27:69":"SAY: \"Travel around the earth and see what the outcome for criminals was like","27:70":"Do not worry about them nor feel any anxiety over whatever they are plotting","27:71":"They are saying: \"When will this promise be, if you are so truthful","27:72":"SAY: \"Perhaps part of what you are try to hurry up will catch you from behind","27:73":"Your Lord possesses bounty for mankind, although most of them are not thankful","27:74":"yet your Lord does know anything your breasts conceal as well as anything they display","27:75":"There is nothing elsewhere in either Heaven or Earth unless it appears in a plain Book","27:76":"This Reading tells the Children of Israel most of what they have been differing over","27:77":"it serves as guidance and a mercy for believers","27:78":"Your Lord will judge between them through His discretion; He is the Powerful, the Aware","27:79":"So rely on God, since you hold manifest Truth","27:80":"You cannot make the dead hear, nor even the deaf hear the Appeal once they turn around to escape","27:81":"You are no one to guide the blind out of their error; you will only cause someone who believes in Our signs to listen, for they are committed to [live in] peace. convinced by Our signs","27:82":"Whenever the Sentence prevails against them, We shall bring forth a monster from the earth for them who will speak to them, because mankind has not been convinced by Our signs","27:83":"Some day We shall summon a troop from every nation which has rejected Our signs, and they will be paraded forth","27:84":"until, when they come [before God], He will say: \"Did you reject My signs and not grasp any knowledge concerning them? What have you been doing","27:85":"The Sentence will prevail against them because of the wrong they have committed. They will not utter [a word]","27:86":"Have they not considered how We have made night so they may rest in it, and daylight so they can see? In that are signs for folk who believe","27:87":"Someday the Trumpet will be blown and startle whoever is in Heaven and whoever is on Earth, except for anyone God may wish. Everyone will come to Him abjectly","27:88":"You will see the mountains, which you reckoned were solid, slip away just as clouds slip away, through the handiwork of God Who consummates everything. He is Informed about whatever you are doing","27:89":"Anyone who comes with a fine deed will have something better than it and they will be safe from that day´s terror","27:90":"while anyone who comes with an evil deed will be flung face down into the Fire: \"Aren´t you rewarded with just what you´ve been doing","27:91":"I have only been ordered to serve the Lord of this region which He has hallowed. He possesses everything. I have been ordered to be a Muslim","27:92":"and to recite the Quran. Anyone who is guided, will be guided only for his own sake, while tell anyone who strays away: ´I am merely a warner","27:93":"SAY: \"Praise be to God! He will show you His signs so you may recognize them. Your Lord is not overlooking anything you do","28:1":"S.M","28:2":"These are verses from the clear Book","28:3":"We shall recite in all truth to you some information about Moses and Pharaoh for folk who believe","28:4":"Pharaoh had acted haughtily on earth and split his people into factions, seeking to weaken a group of them. He slaughtered their sons and let their women live; he was so depraved","28:5":"Yet We wanted to endow those who were considered inferior on earth, and make them into leaders and make them [Our] heirs","28:6":"We established them on earth and showed Pharaoh and Haman as well as their troops how they should beware of them","28:7":"We inspired Moses´ mother [as follows]: \"Nurse him. If you should fear for him, then cast him into the river. Do not fear nor feel sad; We will return him to you, and appoint him as a missionary","28:8":"Pharaoh´s household took him in, so that he became an enemy and [a source of] sadness for them. Pharaoh and Haman as well as their troops were so mistaken","28:9":"Pharaoh´s wife said: \"[He´ll be] a comfort for me and for you. Do not kill him! Perhaps he´ll benefit us, or we´ll adopt him as a son.\" They did not suspect [a thing]","28:10":"Next morning the vitals of Moses´ mother felt empty; she almost revealed who he was, if We had not bound up her heart so she would be a believer","28:11":"She told his sister: \"Keep track of him.\" So she watched out for him from a distance while they did not notice it","28:12":"We kept him from nursing at first, and so she said: \"Shall I lead you to a family who will look after him for you? They will take good care of him","28:13":"Thus We restored him to his mother so he might comfort her and she would not feel so sad, and so she would know that God´s promise is true, even though most of them do not realize it","28:14":"When he reached maturity and came of age, We gave him discretion and knowledge. Thus We reward those who act kindly","28:15":"He entered the city at a time when its people were lax, and found two men fighting there, one from his own sect and the other from his enemy´s. The one who was from his own faction appealed for his assistance against the one who was from his enemy´s. Moses punched him and he finished him off! He said: \"This is some of Satan´s work; he is such an enemy, a plain misleader","28:16":"He said: \"My Lord, I have wronged my own soul. Forgive me!\" So He forgave him; He is the Forgiving, the Merciful","28:17":"He said: \"My Lord, since You have shown me such favor, I shall never back up any criminals [again]","28:18":"Yet he felt fearful next morning in the city; he was on the alert, when the man he had tried to support the day before called out to him for help [again]. Moses told him: \"You are clearly a trouble-maker","28:19":"When he wanted to catch the one who was an enemy to them both, he said: \"Moses, do you want to kill me just as you killed another person yesterday.? You only want to become a bully on earth; you do not want to be a reformer","28:20":"A man came hurrying up from the further end of the city; he said: \"Moses, the councilmen are deliberating about you, whether they should execute you. Clear out! I am giving you sincere advice","28:21":"He left it fearfully, on the alert. He said: \"My Lord, save me from such wrongdoing folk","28:22":"As he made his way towards Midian, he said: \"Perhaps my Lord will guide me along some level path","28:23":"When he approached the water of Midian, he found a company of people watering [their flocks] there, and found two women besides them, holding theirs off at a distance. He said: \"What´s the matter with you?\" They both said: \"We may not draw any water until the herdsmen move on. Our father is an elderly gentleman","28:24":"So he did the watering for them. Then he went off to [rest in] the shade, and said: \"My Lord, I am poor enough to accept anything You may grant me","28:25":"One of the girls came up to him, walking bashfully. She said: \"My father invites you, in order to reward you with some [sort of] payment since you have done the watering for us.\" When he came up to him, he told him the stories. He said: \"Do not fear; you have escaped from wrongdoing folk","28:26":"One of the two (girls) said: \"My father, hire him! The best man you can hire is someone who is strong, trustworthy","28:27":"He said: \"I want to marry you to one of these daughters of mine, provided you hire yourself out to me for eight seasons. If you should complete ten, then that will be your own affair. I do not want to be hard on you; you will find me an honorable man, if God so wishes","28:28":"He said: \"That is up to you and me; whichever term I may serve out, there will be no injustice done to me. God is a Trustee for anything we say","28:29":"When Moses had completed the term [that he had promised to work] and was travelling away with his family, he glimpsed a fire on a slope of Mount [Sinai]. He told his family: \"Stay here! I´ve glimpsed a fire. Perhaps I may bring you some news from it, or an ember from the fire so you may warm yourselves","28:30":"So when he came up to it, someone called out to him from the tree in the blessed hollow on the right bank of the valley: \"Moses, I am God, Lord of the Universe","28:31":"And then: \"Throw down your staff.\" When he saw it twitching as if it were possessed, he turned around and tried to escape. \"Moses, come closer and do not act afraid. You will be safe","28:32":"Slip your hand into your shirtfront; it will come out white without being harmed. And gather up your courage against any apprehension. These will be two proofs from your Lord for Pharaoh and his councilors; they have been such immoral folk","28:33":"He said: \"My Lord, I killed a person among them, and fear they may execute me","28:34":"My brother Aaron is more convincing with his tongue; send him along with me to back me up and vouch for me. I fear they will talk me out of it","28:35":"He said: \"We shall strengthen your arm by means of your brother and grant both of you authority so they will not overtake either of you. Because of Our signs, you both will win out, as well as anyone who follows you","28:36":"When Moses brought them Our clear signs, they said: \"This is only some contrived magic. We have not heard of this through our early forefathers","28:37":"Moses said: \"My Lord is quite Aware as to who brings guidance from His presence and who will attain the Home in the end. Wrongdoers do not succeed","28:38":"Pharaoh said: \"Councilmen, I have not known any god for you except myself. Light [a kiln] for me, Haman, for some clay, and build me a tower so I may climb up to Moses´ god. Still I think he´s a liar","28:39":"Both he and his troops acted overproud on earth without any right [to be so]. They thought they would never return to Us","28:40":"We seized him and his troops and hurled them into the deep. See how the outcome was for wrongdoers","28:41":"We turned them into leaders who invite [men] to the Fire. On Resurrection Day they will not be supported","28:42":"We shall let a curse follow them in this world, while on Resurrection Day they will look hideous","28:43":"We gave Moses the Book after We had wiped out the earliest generations [to serve] as insights for mankind, and for guidance and mercy so they might bear it in mind","28:44":"You [Muhammad], were not (present) on the western slope when We settled the matter for Moses, nor were you a witness","28:45":"but We raised up some generations, and [their] lifetime was prolonged for them. Nor were you a resident among the people of Midian, reciting Our signs to them, but We were [to send] emissaries","28:46":"You were not on the slope of Mount [Sinai] when We called out, but [have been sent] as a mercy from your Lord so you might warn a folk whom no warner had come to before you, so that they might bear it in mind","28:47":"If only some calamity would strike them because of what [evil] their hands have sent on ahead, and so they would say: \"Our Lord, if only you had sent us some messenger, we should have followed Your signs and been believers","28:48":"Yet when the Truth did come to them from Our presence, they said: \"If he were only given the same as Moses was given!\" Still had they not already disbelieved in what Moses was given? They say: \"Double magic, to back each other up!\" And they say: \"We disbelieve in everything","28:49":"SAY: \"Bring a book from God´s presence which will be a better guide than either of them so I may follow it if you are that truthful","28:50":"If they do not respond to you, then know they are merely following their own whims. Who is more misguided than someone who follows his own whim without having any guidance from God? God does not guide wrongdoing folk","28:51":"We have conveyed the Statement to them so they might keep it in mind","28:52":"The ones We gave the Book to previously believe in it","28:53":"whenever it is recited to them, they say: \"We believe in it; it is the Truth from our Lord! We have already committed ourselves to [live in] peace","28:54":"Those will be given their payment twice over because of what they have endured; they ward off evil with good and spend some of what We have provided them with","28:55":"Whenever they hear any gossip, they shun it and say: \"We hold to our actions while you have your actions.\" Peace be upon you! We do not hanker after ignorant people","28:56":"You do not guide someone you love, but God guides anyone He wishes. He is quite Aware as to who are guided","28:57":"They say: \"If we followed guidance along with you, we´d be swept out of our land.\" Yet have We not established a safe haven for them where produce of every sort is brought from Our presence as sustenance? However most of them do not realize it","28:58":"How many towns have We wiped out who were reckless in their way of livings Those dwellings of theirs have been inhabited only occasionally since then. We have been [their] heirs","28:59":"Your Lord has never been the destroyer of any towns unless He had dispatched a messenger to their capital city who recited Our signs to them. Nor did We ever destroy any towns unless their people became wrongdoers","28:60":"Anything you have been given is for enjoyment and as an attraction during worldly life. Yet what God has is better and more lasting. Will you not use your reason","28:61":"Is someone We have made a handsome promise to and who will receive it, like someone whom We have allowed to enjoy worldly life, then will be made to appear on Resurrection Day","28:62":"Some day He will call out to them and say: \"Where are My associates whom you have been claiming","28:63":"The ones against whom the Sentence will be pronounced will say: \"Our Lord, those are the people whom we have misled! We misled them just as we ourselves went astray. We absolve ourselves before You; it was not we whom they worshipped","28:64":"Someone will say: \"Appeal to your associates!\" So they will appeal to them, yet they will not answer them. They will see the Torment-if only they had accepted guidance","28:65":"Some day He will call out to them and say: \"How did you answer the emissaries?\"´","28:66":"The news will seem confusing to them on that day, and they will not [be able to] question one another","28:67":"Yet anyone who repented, believed and acted honorably may possibly be among those who are successful","28:68":"Your Lord creates and chooses anything He wishes; while they have no choice. Praise be to God; Exalted is He over anything they may associate with Him","28:69":"Your Lord knows anything their breasts conceal and anything they may disclose","28:70":"He is God [Alone]; there is no deity except Him! Praise belongs to Him from the very first as well as in the Hereafter. Discretion is His, and to Him will you (all) return","28:71":"SAY: \"Have you considered, if God should lay perpetual night over you until Resurrection Day, what deity besides God would bring you any radiance? Will you not listen","28:72":"SAY: \"Have you considered whether if God should lay perpetual daylight over you until Resurrection Day, what deity other than God would bring you night wherein you might find rest? Will you not observe [these things]","28:73":"Out of His mercy He has granted you night and daytime so you may rest in the one and seek some of His bounty [in the other], and so that you may feel grateful","28:74":"Some day He will call out to them and say: \"Where are My associates whom you have been claiming","28:75":"We shall drag a witness out of every nation and We shall say: ´Bring on your proof!\" They will realize that Truth belongs to God while whatever they were inventing has left them in the lurch","28:76":"Quran belonged to Moses´ folk, and he acted insolently towards them. We gave him such treasures that his keys [alone) would have overburdened a squad of strong men. So his people told him: \"Don´t act so happy, for God does not love people who are too happy","28:77":"Seek a home in the Hereafter through whatever God has given you. Do not neglect your share in this world, and act kindly, just as God has treated you kindly. Do not aim to cause mischief on earth; God does not love mischief makers","28:78":"He said: \"I have been given it only because of some knowledge I possess.\" Did he not realize that God had wiped out generations before him who were stronger than he and possessed even greater resources? Will not criminals be questioned concerning their offences","28:79":"He went forth to his folk [dressed] in his finery. Those who wanted worldly life said: \"If we only had the same as Quran has been given! He has been extremely lucky","28:80":"However those who had been given knowledge said: \"It will be too bad for you! God´s recompense is better for anyone who believes and acts honorably. Yet only the patient will encounter it","28:81":"Then We let the earth swallow up him and his home. He did not have any party to support him against God; he was not supported","28:82":"Those who longed to be in his place the day before, said the next morning: \"Since it is God Who extends sustenance to anyone He wishes from among His servants and measures it out, it would have swallowed us up too if God had not cared for us. It seems that disbelievers do not prosper","28:83":"That home in the Hereafter will We grant to those who want neither haughtiness nor any corruption on earth. The outcome belongs to those who do their duty","28:84":"Anyone who brings a fine deed will have something even better than it, while anyone who comes with an evil deed [will find that] those who perform evil deeds will not be rewarded except for whatever they have been doing","28:85":"The One Who has charged you with the Reading will return you to [your] destination. SAY: \"My Lord is quite Aware as to who has brought guidance and who is in plain error","28:86":"You did not expect that the Book would be delivered to you except as a mercy from your Lord","28:87":"Do not let it distract you [observing] God´s signs once they have been sent down to you. I [people to meet] your Lord and do not be an associator","28:88":"do appeal to any other deity along with God: there is no god except Him. Everything is perishable except His face! Discretion belongs to Him, and to Him will you (all) be returned","29:1":"L.M","29:2":"Do people reckon that they will be left alone just because they say: \"We believe,\" and they will not be tested","29:3":"We have tested the ones who preceded them. God knows the ones who are truthful and He will recognize liars","29:4":"Or do the ones who perform evil deeds reckon they will get ahead of Us? How badly do they judge","29:5":"God´s deadline is coming for anyone who has been expecting to meet God! He is the Alert, Aware","29:6":"Anyone who strives, strives only for his own soul´s sake. God is Transcendent, beyond [any need of] the Universe","29:7":"We will overlook their evil deeds, and reward them with the finest of whatever they have been doing","29:8":"We have instructed everyman to treat his parents kindly. Yet if they should strive to make you associate anything with Me which you have no knowledge of, do not obey them! To Me shall be your return, and I will notify you about anything you have been doing","29:9":"We will let the ones who believe and perform honorable deeds enter in among honorable people","29:10":"There are some people who say: \"We believe in God\"; yet whenever they suffer abuse for God´s sake, they maintain that any trials by mankind are like God´s torment. If any support should come from your Lord, they would say: \"We have stood alongside you.\" Is God not quite Aware of what is on the minds of [everybody in] the Universe","29:11":"God does recognize those who believe and He (also) recognizes hypocrites","29:12":"Those who disbelieve tell those who believe: \"Follow our course and we will assume [responsibility for] your mistakes.\" They will not assume their mistakes in any way: they are such liars","29:13":"However they will carry their own loads and others´ loads besides their own. They will be questioned on Resurrection Day about what they have invented","29:14":"We sent Noah to his folk. He remained among them for a thousand years less fifty twelvemonths. The Flood seized them while they were doing wrong","29:15":"However We saved him and the companions in the ship, and made it into a sign for [everyone in] the Universe","29:16":"Next Abraham told his folk: \"Serve God and heed Him. That will be best for you if you only realized it","29:17":"You serve only images instead of God, and create a sham. The ones you serve instead of God do not control any sustenance for you, so seek sustenance from God Himself and serve Him; act grateful towards Him; to Him will you be returned","29:18":"Yet if you should deny it - and nations before you have already denied such-the Messenger has only to deliver [his message] clearly","29:19":"Have they not seen how God begins with creation, then performs it all over again? That is so easy for God [to do]","29:20":"SAY: \"Travel around the earth and see how He began with creation; later on God raises up fresh growth. God is Capable of everything","29:21":"He punishes anyone He wishes to and shows mercy to anyone He wishes; to Him will you be restored","29:22":"You cannot prevent anything [from happening] on earth nor in Heaven; you have no patron nor any supporter besides God","29:23":"Those who reject God´s signs and [any hope of] meeting Him despair of My mercy; those will have painful torment","29:24":"There was no answer from his folk except they said: \"Kill him or bum him up!\" Yet God saved him from the fire; in that are signs for folk who believe","29:25":"He said: \"You have merely adopted images instead of God, out of affection for one another during worldly life. Then on Resurrection Day some of you will disown one another while others of you will curse each other. Your refuge will be the Fire; you will have no supporters","29:26":"Lot believed in him and he said: \"I will move elsewhere for my Lord´s sake. He is the Powerful, the Wise","29:27":"We bestowed Isaac and Jacob on him, and granted prophethood and the Book to his offspring. We gave him his payment in this world while in the Hereafter he will be among the honorable","29:28":"So Lot told his folk: \"You indulge in such sexual misconduct as no one in the Universe has attempted before you","29:29":"You even accost men and intercept [them on] the highway! You commit such a horrible thing in your clubs.\" * His folk´s answer was merely to say: \"Bring us God´s torment if you are so truthful","29:30":"He said: \"My Lord, support me against such degenerate folk","29:31":"When Our messengers brought Abraham the good news, they said: \"We´ll destroy the people of this town. Its people have been doing wrong","29:32":"He said: \"Yet Lot is in it!\" They said: \"We are quite aware as to who is in it. We´ll save both him and his household, except for his wife; she is one of those who will stay behind","29:33":"When Our messengers came to Lot, he felt wretched because of them, for [his] ability to protect them was so slender. They said: \"Do not fear nor feel so sad. We shall save you and your family, except for your wife; she will be one of those who will stay behind","29:34":"We are sending a blight down from Heaven upon the people of this town because they have been acting so depraved","29:35":"We have left some of it as a clear sign for folk who will [use their powers of] reason","29:36":"To Midian [was sent] their brother Shuayb.

Those will have forgiveness and generous provision","34:5":"while the ones who work against Our signs in order to defeat them will have painful torment from a blight","34:6":"Those who have been given knowledge see that what has been sent down to you from your Lord is the Truth, and guides [us] along the Road to the Powerful, the Praiseworthy","34:7":"while those who disbelieve say: \"Shall we introduce you to a man who will notify you, once you have been utterly torn to pieces, that you will [reappear] in some fresh creation","34:8":"Has he invented a lie about God or has he some sprite within him?\" Rather the ones who do not believe in the Hereafter will be in torment and extreme error","34:9":"Have they not considered whatever lies before them from the sky and earth, and what is behind them? If We wished, We would let the earth swallow them up or a patch of sky drop down on them. In that is a sign for every penitent servant","34:10":"We gave David bounty from Ourself: \"O mountains, echo back [God´s praises] along with him! And [so may] the birds.\" We softened iron for him","34:11":"Make suits of armor and measure out the links in mail, and act honorably; I am Observant of anything you do","34:12":"Solomon possessed the wind; it would blow for a month in one direction and then blow back for [another] month. We melted down a font of brass for him. There were some sprites who worked in front of him by his Lord´s permission, and We let any of them who wavered from Our command taste torment from the Blaze","34:13":"They worked away for him just as he wished on shrines and images, bowls as big as troughs and built-in cauldrons: \"Give thanks, 0 House of David!\" Yet few of My servants are grateful","34:14":"When We determined he should die, nothing indicated his death to them except a worm from the earth which was eating away at his cane. When he fell down, the sprites realized clearly that if they had known the Unseen, they would not have had to continue in such humiliating torment","34:15":"There had been a sign for Sheba in their dwelling: two gardens, to the right and left: \"Eat some of your Lord´s provision and thank Him. Such a good land and forgiving Lord","34:16":"They spurned [it], so We sent a torrent from the dam upon them, and We changed both their gardens for them into two gardens yielding bitter food, tamarisk and a very few hawthorns","34:17":"That is how We rewarded them for the way they disbelieved. Should We reward only the ungrateful person","34:18":"We placed towns in plain view between them and the towns which We had blessed, and We measured out travel between them: \"Travel safely between them by night and day","34:19":"They said: \"Our Lord, lengthen the distance between our stops!\" They wronged themselves so We turned them into legends; We scattered them into every [possible] fragment. In that are signs for every patient, grateful person","34:20":"Diabolis proved his idea was sound about them: they (all) followed him except for a group of believers","34:21":"Yet he held no authority over them, except so We might distinguish someone who believes in the Hereafter from someone who is in any uncertainty about it. Your Lord acts as an Overseer for everything","34:22":"SAY: \"Appeal to those whom you claim to instead of to God; they do not control even an atom´s weight in either Heaven nor on Earth.\" They have no share in either, nor has He any backer among them","34:23":"Intercession does not benefit anyone so far as He is concerned except for someone He grants it to, until when [panic] is driven from their hearts, they say: \"What did your Lord say?\" They will say: \"The Truth!\" He is the Sublime, the Great","34:24":"SAY: \"Who provides for you out of Heaven and Earth?\" SAY: \"God [Alone].\" Are either we or you closer to guidance, or else in obvious error","34:25":"SAY: \"You will not be questioned about what we have perpetrated nor shall we be questioned about what you have done","34:26":"SAY: \"Our Lord will gather us in together; then things will be opened up in all Truth for us. He is the Opener, the Aware","34:27":"SAY: \"Show me the ones you have connected with Him as associates. It cannot be; rather He is God, the Powerful, the Wise","34:28":"We have not sent you [Muhammad] except as a newsbearer and warner to every single human being, even though most men do not realize it","34:29":"and they say: \"When will this promise be if you (all) have been so truthful","34:30":"SAY: \"You hold an appointment for a day which will be neither postponed nor advanced by so much as an hour","34:31":"Those who disbelieve say: \"We´ll never believe in this Reading nor in the one which (came] before it.\" If you could only see how, when wrongdoers are stationed before their Lord, they will toss the statement back and forth at one another. Those who had been despised as weaklings will tell those who acted overbearing: \"If it were not for you, we´d be believers","34:32":"Those who were overbearing will tell those who acted like weaklings: \"Did we block you off from guidance once it came to you? Rather you yourselves were guilty","34:33":"Those who had been despised will tell those who were overbearing: \"Rather there was plotting night and day when you ordered us to disbelieve in God and we set up rivals to him.\" They will conceal their regret once they see the torment; We will place fetters around the necks of those who disbelieve. Will they not be rewarded for just what they have been doing","34:34":"We have sent no town a warner unless its high-livers said: \"We are disbelievers in what you have been sent with","34:35":"They say: \"We have more wealth and children, and will not be tormented","34:36":"SAY: \"My Lord extends sustenance to anyone He wishes and budgets it, even though most men do not realize it","34:37":"It is not your wealth nor your children that will bring you close to Us in patronage; only someone who believes and acts honorably (will do so). Those will have a double reward because of what they have done. They will feel secure in mansions","34:38":"while those who were attempting to thwart 0ur signs will be paraded forth into torment","34:39":"SAY: \"My Lord extends sustenance to anyone He wishes among His servants and He budgets it out. He will compensate you for anything you have spent since He is the best Provider","34:40":"Some day He will summon them all together; then He will say to the angels: \"Are those the ones who were worshipping you","34:41":"They will say: \"Glory be to You! You are our Patron rather than they. Instead they have been worshipping sprites; most of them even believe in them","34:42":"Some day when some of them will not control any advantage nor harm for others, We will tell those who have done wrong: \"Taste the torment of Fire which you have been denying","34:43":"When Our clear verses are recited to them, they will say: \"This is only a man who wants to discourage you from [worshipping] what your forefathers have been worshipping.\" They will say: \"This is only some invented sham.\" Those who disbelieve will say about Truth, once it comes to them: \"This is nothing but sheer magic","34:44":"We did not bring them any books to study from nor send them any warner before you","34:45":"Those who [lived] before them denied it and did not achieve a tenth of what We gave them. They even rejected My messengers, so [imagine] how [real] was My disgust","34:46":"SAY: \"I preach only one thing to you: that you stand up in pairs or singly for God; then consider how there is no madness in your companion. He is only a warner [sent] to you in the face of stern torment","34:47":"SAY: \"What I ask you in payment is merely something for yourselves. My own payment lies only up to God; He is a Witness for everything","34:48":"SAY: \"My Lord, the Knower of Unseen things, aims at the Truth","34:49":"SAY: \"Truth has come, while falsehood neither originates nor does anything over again","34:50":"SAY: \"If I have strayed, I have only led myself astray; while if I have been guided, then it is because of what my Lord has inspired in me. He is Alert, so Near!\" The Pursuit of Faith","34:51":"If you could see when they are startled and there is no escape, and they are seized from a place near at hand","34:52":"how they will say: \"We believe in it!\" Yet have they any way to snatch it up at such a distance","34:53":"They have already disbelieved in it, and aimed at [knowing] the Unseen from a distance","34:54":"Something will intervene between them and whatever they crave to have, just as was done with their [different] sects long before. They have [lived] in such suspicious doubt","35:1":"Praise be to God, Originator of Heaven and Earth, Who appoints the Angels as winged messengers in pairs, and in threes and fours. He increases anything He wishes through creation; God is Capable of everything","35:2":"There is no withholding any mercy that God may open up for mankind; while neither is there any [means of] sending anything later on once He has withheld it. He is the Powerful, the Wise","35:3":"Mankind, remember God´s favor towards you. Is there any creator besides God who provides for you out of the sky and earth? There is no deity except Him; yet you shrug Him off","35:4":"If they should reject you, well, messengers before you have already been rejected. To God are matters referred","35:5":"Mankind, God´s promise is true; do not let worldly life lure you on nor let the Deceiver deceive you concerning God","35:6":"Satan is an enemy of yours, so treat him as an enemy: he only calls his party to become inmates of the Blaze","35:7":"Those who disbelieve will have severe punishment while those who believe and act honorably will have forgiveness and great earnings","35:8":"Does anyone exist whose evil action seems so attractive to him that he regards it as fine? God lets anyone He wishes go astray while He guides whomever He wishes. Do not let yourself go around pitying them; God is Aware of what they are producing","35:9":"God is the One Who sends the winds to blow the clouds along. We drive them on to a dead land, and revive the earth by means of them after it has died. Such is regeneration","35:10":"For anyone who has been wanting glory, God holds all glory: towards Him do wholesome words ascend while honorable action He exalts. Those who plot evil deeds will have severe punishment while their very plotting will collapse","35:11":"God has created you from dust, then from a drop of semen; then He divided you into couples. No female conceives nor gives birth unless He knows it. No elderly person grows even older nor has anything shortened from his life unless it is [written down] in some book. That is easy for God [to do]","35:12":"Both seas are not alike: this one is sweet, fresh, refreshing to drink, while the other is salty, briny. From each you catch fresh meat and extract jewelry you wear. You see ships sailing along on it so you may seek His bounty and so that you may feel thankful","35:13":"He wraps night up into daytime and wraps daytime up in night, and regulates the sun and moon; each runs along on a stated course. Such is God, your Lord! Control belongs to Him; while the ones whom you appeal to instead of Him do not control a wisp","35:14":"If you should appeal to them, they will not hear your appeal; while even though they heard it, they would not respond to you.

You can only warn those who dread their Lord although [He is] Unseen, and keep up prayer. Anyone who purifies himself, only purifies his own soul. Towards God should lie one´s goal","35:19":"The blind and the sighted are not equal","35:20":"nor are darkness and light","35:21":"nor a shady nook and a heatwave","35:22":"The living and the dead are not alike. God lets anyone He wishes listen, while you will not make those in their graves hear","35:23":"You are nothing but a warner","35:24":"We have sent you as an announcer and a warner about the Truth. No nation exists unless some warner has passed among them","35:25":"Yet if they should reject you, well the ones before them rejected [their messengers too]; their messengers brought them explanations, the Psalms, and an enlightening Book","35:26":"Then I seized the ones who disbelieved. How great was My displeasure","35:27":"Have you not seen how God sends water down from the sky? We produce different colored fruits with it. From the mountains come white and red marbling in different shades as well as black obsidian","35:28":"Some men, wild beasts and livestock are of different colors as well. Yet only His learned servants dread God [Alone], even though God is Powerful, Forgiving","35:29":"The ones who recite God´s book, keep up prayer and spend something both secretly and publicly from whatever He has provided for them, can hope for a business which will never slacken","35:30":"so He may repay them their earnings and grant them even more out of His bounty. He is Forgiving, Appreciative","35:31":"What We have revealed to you from the Book is the Truth confirming what has preceded it. God is Informed, Observant concerning His servants","35:32":"Then We allow some of Our servants whom We have singled out to inherit the Book. One of them may harm his own soul while another is lukewarm, and still another vies in performing good deeds with God´s permission. It [will mean] great bounty","35:33":"gardens of Eden will they enter. They will be allowed to wear gold and pearl bracelets there while their clothing will be [made of] silk","35:34":"They will say: \"Praise be to God Who has lifted sadness from us! Our Lord is Forgiving, Appreciative","35:35":"the One Who has settled us in the Everlasting Home because of His bounty. No toil will ever touch us there nor will any weariness affect us in it","35:36":"The ones who disbelieved will have Hell fire. It will be neither finished off for them so that they may [really] die; nor will its torment be lightened for them. Thus We reward every ingrate","35:37":"They will scream away in it: \"Our Lord, take us out! We´ll act honorably, so differently from the way we have been acting!\" Did We not let you live on and on so anyone who bears things in mind might remember (them) during its course? The Warner came to you. So have a taste! Wrongdoers will have no supporter","35:38":"God is the One Who knows the Unseen in both Heaven and Earth. He is Aware of whatever is on your minds","35:39":"He is the One Who has set you up as [His] representatives on earth. Anyone who disbelieves is responsible for his own disbelief. Their disbelief merely increases disbelievers in loathing towards their Lord; their disbelief involves disbelievers in even greater loss","35:40":"SAY: \"Have you ever seen your associates whom you appeal to instead of to God? Show me what part of earth they have created. Have they any partnership in Heaven? Or have We given them a book? Have they come upon any explanation from it? Rather wrongdoers merely promise one another delusion","35:41":"God grasps both Heaven and Earth lest either one should slip out of place. If either should slip out of place, no one else would hold on to them besides Him. God is Lenient, Forgiving","35:42":"They have sworn before God by their most solemn oaths that if a warner should ever come to them, they would be better guided than any other nation. Yet whenever a warner has come to them, it only increased their aversion","35:43":"because of how proud they had acted on earth and plotted evil. Plotting evil engulfs the people who practice it. Are they only waiting for what happened to primitive people? Yet you will never find any change in God´s practice, nor will you ever find any substitute for God´s practice","35:44":"Have they not travelled around the earth and observed how the outcome went for those who preceded them? They were much stronger than they are. God will not be thwarted by anything in Heaven nor on Earth; He is Aware, Capable","35:45":"If God should take mankind to task for whatever they have been earning, He would not leave any creature on its surface; but He puts them off for a specific period. Once their deadline comes, God will indeed be Observant of His servants","36:1":"S","36:2":"By the Wise Reading","36:3":"you are an emissary","36:4":"[sent] along a Straight Road","36:5":"with a revelation from the Powerful, the Merciful","36:6":"so you may warn a folk whose forefathers have not been warned, and hence they are unaware","36:7":"The statement has been proven to be true about most of them, yet they still will not believe","36:8":"We have placed fetters around their necks which reach up to their chins till they seem to be out of joint","36:9":"We have placed a barrier before them and another barrier behind them, and have covered them up so they do not notice anything","36:10":"It is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them; they still will not believe","36:11":"You will only warn someone who follows the Reminder and dreads the Mercy-giving even though He is Unseen. Proclaim forgiveness and generous payment to him","36:12":"We revive the dead and write down whatever they have sent on ahead and [left] as traces; We calculate everything in an open ledger","36:13":"Compose a parable for them about the inhabitants of the town when emissaries came to them","36:14":"When We sent them two, they rejected them both, so We reinforced them with a third","36:15":"They said; \"You are only human beings like ourselves. The Mercy-giving has net sent anything down; you are only lying","36:16":"They said: \"Our Lord knows that we have been [sent] to you as emissaries","36:17":"We have only to proclaim things clearly","36:18":"They said: \"We sense something unlucky about you; so if you will not stop, we´ll expel you, and painful torment from us will afflict you","36:19":"They said: \"The bad luck you sense lies within yourselves. Will you not be reminded? Indeed you are such dissipated folk","36:20":"A man came hurrying up from the further end of the city. he said: \"O my people, follow the emissaries","36:21":"Follow someone who does not ask for any payment while they are being guided","36:22":"Why should I worship the One Who fashioned me and to Whom you will (all) return","36:23":"Should I adopt other gods instead of Him? If the Mercy-giving should want any harm [to happen] to me, their intercession would never help me out in any way nor would they rescue me","36:24":"I´d then be completely lost","36:25":"I believe in your Lord, so hear me","36:26":"He was told: \"Enter the Garden.\" He said: \"If my people only knew","36:27":"how my Lord has forgiven me and placed me among the honored ones","36:28":"We did not send any army down from Heaven to his folk after him, nor do We ever send any down","36:29":"There was only a single Blast, and imagine, they [lay] shriveled up","36:30":"What a pity it is with such worshippers! No messenger has ever come to them unless they made fun of him","36:31":"Have they not seen how many generations We have wiped out before them who will never return to them","36:32":"Each will be arraigned so they all stand before Us","36:33":"The dead earth serves as a sign for them; We revive it and bring forth grain from it which they may eat","36:34":"We have placed date groves and vineyards on it, and make springs flow forth from it","36:35":"so they may eat its fruit. Their own hands did not produce it. So, will they not give thanks","36:36":"Glory be to the One Who has created every kind of species such as the earth grows, their own kind, and even some things they do not know","36:37":"Another sign for them is night; We strip daylight off from it so they are plunged into darkness","36:38":"The sun runs along on a course of its own. Such is the design of the Powerful, the Aware","36:39":"And We have designed phases for the moon so it finally appears again like an old palm frond","36:40":"The sun dare not overtake the moon nor does night outpace the day. Each floats along in its own orbit","36:41":"Another for them is how We transported their offspring on the laden ship","36:42":"We have created something like it for them on which they must sail","36:43":"If We wished, We might even let them drown and they would have no one to cry out to, nor would they be rescued","36:44":"except as a mercy from Us and to enjoy things for a while","36:45":"When they are told: \"Heed what lies in front of you and what´s behind you so that you may find mercy","36:46":"not one of their Lord´s signs has come to them except they tried to avoid it","36:47":"When they are (also) told: \"Spend something God has provided you with,\" the ones who disbelieve tell those who believe: \"Should we feed someone whom God would feed if He so wishes? You are quite obviously in error","36:48":"They say: \"When will this promise occur if you are so truthful","36:49":"They need only wait for a single Blast to catch them while they are arguing away","36:50":"They will not even manage to draw up a will, nor will they return to their own people","36:51":"The Trumpet will be blow and then they will swarm forth from their tombs to meet their Lord","36:52":"They will say: \"It´s too bad for us! Whoever has raised us up from our sleeping quarters? This is what the Mercy-giving promised; the emissaries have been telling the truth","36:53":"There will be only a single Blast and then they will all be assembled in Our presence","36:54":"On that day no soul will be harmed in any way, and you will be rewarded only for what you have been doing","36:55":"The inhabitants of the Garden will be happily at work of that day","36:56":"They and their spouses will relax on couches in shady nooks","36:57":"they will have fruit and they shall have anything they request","36:58":"Peace!\" will be a greeting from a Merciful Lord","36:59":"Step aside today, you criminals","36:60":"Did I not contract you, O children of Adam, not to serve Satan? He is an open enemy of yours","36:61":"And to worship Me [Alone]! This is a Straight Road","36:62":"He has led a numerous mob of you astray. Haven´t you been reasoning things out","36:63":"This is Hell, which you were threatened with","36:64":"Roast in it today because you have disbelieved","36:65":"That day We shall seal their mouths up while their hands will speak to Us and their feet bear witness about what they have been earning","36:66":"If We so wished, We would put their eyes out so they must grope along the Road. Yet how will they ever notice [anything]","36:67":"If We wished, We would nail them to the spot so they would not manage to keep on going nor would they ever return","36:68":"Anyone We grant long life to, We switch around within creation. Will they not use their reason","36:69":"We have not taught him any poetry nor would it be fitting for him. It is merely a Reminder and a clear Reading","36:70":"so he may warn anyone who is alive and the Sentence may be confirmed against disbelievers","36:71":"Have they not considered how We have created livestock for them out of what Our own hands have made, and they are masters over them","36:72":"We let them tame them: some of them are to be ridden, while others they eat","36:73":"they receive benefits and drinks from them.

Prophets and witnesses will be brought in, and judgment will be pronounced among them formally, and they will not be harmed","39:70":"Every soul will be repaid for whatever it has done; He is quite Aware of what they are doing","39:71":"The ones who disbelieve will be driven along to Hell in throngs until, just as they come up to it, its gates will swing open and its keepers will say to them: \"Did not messengers come to you from among yourselves reciting your Lord´s verses to you and warning you about meeting [Him] on this day of yours?\" They will say: \"Of course!\" But the Sentence about torment has still come due for disbelievers","39:72":"Someone else will say: \"Enter Hell´s gates to remain there. What an awful lodging will it be for the overbearing","39:73":"The ones who have heeded their Lord will be driven along to the Garden in throngs until just as they come up to it, its gates will swing open and its keepers will tell them: \"Peace be upon you! You have been good, so enter it to remain there","39:74":"They will say: \"Praise be to God Who has held True to His promise for us and let us inherit the earth! We shall settle down anywhere we wish to in the Garden. How favored are such workers´ wages","39:75":"You will see the angels clustering around the Throne hymning their Lord´s praise. Judgment will be pronounced on them formally, and someone will say: \"Praise be to God, Lord of the Universe","40:1":"M","40:2":"The revelation of the Book [comes] through God, the Powerful, the Aware","40:3":"Forgiving sin and Receiving Repentance, Stern in punishment, Wielder of Influence.

Every nation worried about their own messenger, how to catch him [off guard]. They argued with him in vain to refute the Truth. So I caught up with them and how [awful] was My punishment","40:6":"Thus your Lord´s word will be confirmed against those who disbelieve; they [will become] inmates of the Fire","40:7":"The ones who uphold the Throne and anyone surrounding it hymn their Lord´s praise and believe in Him.

Forgive those who repent and follow Your path: shield them from the torment of Hades","40:8":"Our Lord, show them into the gardens of eternity which You have promised them, and whoever among their forefathers, spouses and off-spring have acted honorably. You are the Powerful, the Wise","40:9":"Shield them from evil deeds. You will show mercy on that day to anyone You shield from evil deeds. That will be the supreme Achievement","40:10":"The ones who disbelieve will be addressed [as follows]: \"God´s disgust will be even greater than your own disgust is towards one another when you are called upon to believe and [still] disbelieve","40:11":"They will say: Our Lord, You have let us die twice and have revived us twice, and so we [now] acknowledge our sins. Is there no way to escape from here","40:12":"This has happened because you disbelieved when God was invoked in His Oneness, while if others were associated with him, you would believe. Discretion belongs to God, the Sublime, the Great","40:13":"He is the One Who shows you His signs and sends you down sustenance from the sky.

God is the Alert, the Observant","40:21":"Have they not travelled around the earth and seen what the outcome was for those who preceded them? They were even stronger than they are and left more remains on earth. God seized them because of their sins and there was no one to shield them from God","40:22":"That was because their own messengers were sent to them with explanations and they still disbelieved. So God seized them; He is Strong, Stern in punishment","40:23":"We sent Moses with Our signs and clear authority","40:24":"to Pharaoh, Haman and Quran. They said: \"[He´s] a lying magician","40:25":"When he brought them the Truth from Our presence, they said: \"Kill the sons of those who have believed along with him, and let their women live.\" Yet disbelievers´ plotting only goes astray","40:26":"Pharaoh said: ´Let me kill Moses!

He has brought you explanations about your Lord. If he is a liar, then his lie falls upon himself, while if he is truthful, some of what he threatens you with will afflict you. God does not guide anyone who is a preposterous liar","40:29":"My folk, you hold control today as masters d earth. Who will support us against God´s might if it should ever come to us?\" Pharaoh said: \"I am only showing you what I see myself, I am only guiding you along the path of normal behavior","40:30":"The man who believed said: \"My folk, I fear the same for you as [happened] on the day of the Coalition","40:31":"the same as in the case of Noah´s folk, and Ad´s and Thamud´s, as well as those who came after them.

You will not have any defender against God; anyone whom God lets go astray will have no guide","40:34":"Joseph brought you explanations before, yet you continued to suspect what he had brought you until when he perished, you said: ´God will never dispatch a messenger after him!´ Thus God lets any extravagant doubter stray away","40:35":"the ones who argue about God´s signs without any authority to do so having been brought them, incur the greatest disgust so far as God is concerned and so far as those who believe are concerned. Thus God seals off every overbearing oppressor´s heart","40:36":"Pharaoh said; \"Haman, build me a tower so that I may reach the means of access","40:37":"the access to Heaven, so I may climb up to Moses´ God. Still I think he is a liar.\" Thus his evil action was made to seem attractive to Pharaoh, and he was hampered along the Way. Pharaoh´s plot only meant (his own) downfall","40:38":"The believing man said: \"My folk, follow me; I´ll guide you along the path of common sense","40:39":"My folk, this worldly life is to be enjoyed only [briefly]; the Hereafter is the Home to settle down in","40:40":"Anyone who commits some evil deed will merely be rewarded with something else like it, while someone who acts honorably, whether it is a man or a woman, provided he is a believer will enter the Garden.

Our ultimate appeal will be to God, while the dissipated will become inmates of the Fire","40:44":"You must remember what I am telling you! I shall entrust my affair to God, for God is Observant of [His] worshippers","40:45":"God shielded him from the evil deeds they plotted while the worst torment engulfed Pharaoh´s court","40:46":"the Fire! They will be exposed to it morning and evening, while on the day when the Hour is set up [there will be heard]: \"Send Pharaoh´s court into the harshest torment","40:47":"As they quarrel away inside the Fire, the weaklings will tell those who acted proudly: \"We were your following.
