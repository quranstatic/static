It will not change for him the retribution even if he lived so long, God is watchful over what you do","2:97":"Say: \"Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel, then know that he has sent it down into your heart with the permission of God, authenticating what is with him, and a guide and good news for the believers","2:98":"Whoever is an enemy to God and His angels, and His messengers, and Gabriel, and Michael, then so God is the enemy to the disbelievers","2:99":"We have sent down to you clear revelations; only the wicked would disbelieve in them","2:100":"Is it that each time they make a pledge, a group of them breaks it? Alas, most of them do not believe","2:101":"And when a messenger came to them from God, authenticating what was with them, a group of those who had already received the Book placed the Book of God behind their backs as if they did not know","2:102":"And they followed what the devils recited regarding the kingship of Solomon. Solomon did not reject, but it was the devils who rejected by teaching people magic, and teaching them what was sent down on the two angels in Babylon, Haroot and Maroot. They did not teach anyone until they would say: \"We are a test, so do not lose faith!\" Thus they teach what can separate between a person and his mate; but they cannot harm anyone except with the permission of God. And they learn what harms them and does not benefit them, and they have known that he who purchases such has no place in the Hereafter. Miserable indeed is what they purchased with their souls if only they knew","2:103":"And had they believed and been righteous, it would have brought them a recompense with God which is far better if only they knew","2:104":"O you who believe, do not say: \"Shepherd us,\" but say: \"Be patient with us,\" and listen.

Indeed, You are the Grantor","3:9":"Our Lord, You will gather the people for a Day in which there is no doubt; God does not break His appointment","3:10":"As for those who rejected, neither their money nor their children will avail them anything from God. They are the fuel of the Fire","3:11":"Like the behavior of the people of Pharaoh and those before them. They rejected Our signs so God took them for their sins. God is awesome in retribution","3:12":"Say to those who have rejected: \"You will be defeated and gathered towards Hell, what a miserable abode","3:13":"There was a sign for you in the two groups that met. One was fighting in the cause of God, and the other was rejecting. They thus saw them as twice their number with their eyes. And God supports with His victory whom He wills. In this is a lesson for those with vision","3:14":"It has been adorned for people to love the desire of women, and sons, and ornaments made from gold and silver, and trained horses, and livestock, and fields. These are the enjoyment of the world, and with God is the best abode","3:15":"Say: \"Shall I inform you of what is greater than all this? For those who believe in their Lord will be estates with rivers flowing beneath them; abiding therein, and with pure mates, and an acceptance from God. And God is Seer over the servants","3:16":"The ones who say: \"Our Lord, we believe, so forgive us our sins, and spare us the retribution of the Fire","3:17":"The patient, and the truthful, and the dutiful, and the givers, and the seekers of forgiveness in the late hours of the night","3:18":"God bears witness that there is no god except He, as do the angels, and those with knowledge, He is standing with justice. There is no god except He, the Noble, the Wise","3:19":"The system with God is submission, and those who received the Book did not dispute except after the knowledge came to them out of jealousy between them. And whoever rejects the revelations of God, then God is swift in judgment","3:20":"If they debate with you, then say: \"I have submitted myself to God, as well as those who follow me.\" And say to those who have received the Book and the Gentiles: \"Have you submitted?\" If they have submitted then they are guided, and if they turn away, then you are only to deliver, and God is Seer over the servants","3:21":"Those who reject the revelations of God and kill the prophets without right, and kill those who order justice from among the people; inform them of a painful retribution","3:22":"These are the ones whose works will be lost in this world, and in the Hereafter they will have no supporters","3:23":"Did you not see those who were given a portion of the Book being invited to the Book of God to judge between them, then a group of them turns away while they are adverse","3:24":"That is because they said: \"The Fire will not touch us except for a few number of days,\" and they were arrogant by what they invented in their system","3:25":"How shall it be when We gather them on the Day in which there is no doubt; and every soul shall receive what it has earned, and they will not be wronged","3:26":"Say: \"Our god, Possessor of kingship; you grant kingship to whom You please, and revoke kingship from whom You please, and honor whom You please, and humiliate whom You please; in Your hand is goodness. You are capable of all things","3:27":"You blend the night into the day, and blend the day into the night; and you bring the living out of the dead, and bring the dead out of the living; and You provide for whom You wish without reckoning","3:28":"Let not the believers take the rejecters as allies instead of the believers. And whoever does so will have nothing with God; for you are to be cautious of them as they deserve. And God warns you of Himself, and to God is the destiny","3:29":"Say: \"Whether you hide what is in your chests or you reveal it, God will know.\" And He knows what is in the heavens and the earth; and God is capable of all things","3:30":"The Day every soul will find what good it had done present; and what bad it had done, it will wish that between them was a great distance. And God warns you of Himself, and God is Compassionate towards the servants","3:31":"Say: \"If you love God then follow me so God will love you and forgive your sins.\" God is Forgiver, Merciful","3:32":"Say: \"Obey God and the messenger.\" But if they turn away, then God does not love the rejecters","3:33":"God has selected Adam, and Noah, and the family of Abraham, and the family of Imran over the worlds","3:34":"A progeny each from the other, and God is Hearer, Knower","3:35":"When the wife of Imran said: \"My Lord, I have vowed to You what is in my womb, devoted, so accept from me, You are the Hearer, the Knower","3:36":"So when she had delivered she said: \"My Lord, I have delivered a female,\" and God is fully aware of what she delivered, \"And the male is not like the female, and I have named her Mary, and I seek refuge for her and her progeny with You from the outcast devil","3:37":"So her Lord accepted her a good acceptance, and made her grow into a good growth, and charged Zachariah with her. Every time Zachariah entered upon her in the temple enclosure, he found provisions with her. He said: \"O Mary, from where did you get this?\" She said: \"It is from God, for God provides for whom He wishes without reckoning","3:38":"It was then that Zachariah implored his Lord; he said: \"My Lord, grant me from You a good progeny. You are the hearer of prayer","3:39":"So the angels called to him while he was standing, making contact, in the temple enclosure: \"God gives you glad tidings of John, authenticating the word from God, and a master, and steadfast, and a prophet from the upright","3:40":"He said: \"My Lord, how can I have a son when old age has reached me and my wife is infertile?\" He said: \"It is as such that God does what He pleases","3:41":"He said: \"My Lord, make for me a sign.\" He said: \"Your sign is not to speak to the people for three days except by symbol, and remember your Lord greatly, and glorify at dusk and dawn","3:42":"And the angels said: \"O Mary, God has selected you and cleansed you, and He has selected you over all the women of the worlds","3:43":"O Mary, be dutiful to your Lord and prostrate and kneel with those who kneel","3:44":"This is from the news of the unseen that We inspire to you. You were not with them when they drew straws as to which one of them will be charged with Mary; you were not with them when they disputed","3:45":"And the angels said: \"O Mary, God gives you glad tidings of a word from Him. His name is the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary. Honorable in this world and in the Hereafter, and from among those who are made close","3:46":"And he will speak to the people from the cradle and to middle-age, and is from among the upright","3:47":"She said: \"My Lord, how can I have a son when no human being has been with me?\" He said: \"It is thus that God creates what He wills, when He decrees a command, He merely says to it 'Be,' and it is","3:48":"And He teaches him the Book and the Wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel","3:49":"And as a messenger to the Children of Israel: \"I have come to you with a sign from your Lord; that I create for you from clay the form of a bird, then I blow into it and it becomes a bird with the permission of God, and I heal the blind and the lepers, and give life to the dead with the permission of God, and I prophesize for you what you shall eat and what to store in your homes.

Do you not comprehend","3:66":"Here you have debated in what you knew; so why then do you debate in what you do not know? And God knows while you do not know","3:67":"Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Nazarene, but he was a monotheist who submitted; he was not of the polytheists","3:68":"The most legitimate people to Abraham are those who followed him; and this prophet, and those who believed; and God is the supporter of the believers","3:69":"A group from the people of the Book wished that they could misguide you, but they only misguide themselves and they do not notice","3:70":"O people of the Book, why do you reject the revelations of God while you are bearing witness","3:71":"O people of the Book, why do you confound the truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know","3:72":"And a group from among the people of the Book said: \"Believe in what was sent down to those who believe during the beginning of the day, and reject it by the end of it, perhaps they will return","3:73":"And do not believe except in he who follows your system.\" Say: \"The guidance is the guidance of God.\" That anyone should be given similar to what you have been given, or that they debate with you at your Lord. Say: \"The bounty is in the hand of God, He gives it to whom He chooses, and God is Encompassing, Knowledgeable","3:74":"He singles out with His mercy whom He chooses, and God is with Great Bounty","3:75":"And from among the people of the Book are those whom if you entrust him with a large amount he gives it back to you, and there are those whom if you entrust with one gold coin he will not return it to you unless you are standing over him. That is because they said: \"We have no obligation towards the Gentiles.\" They say about God lies while they know","3:76":"Indeed, anyone who fulfils his pledge and is righteous, then God loves the righteous","3:77":"The ones who purchase with the pledge of God and their oaths a cheap price, those will have no portion in the Hereafter, and God will not speak to them, nor will He look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful retribution","3:78":"And from among them is a group who twist their tongues with the Book so that you may think it is from the Book, while it is not from the Book, and they say it is from God while it is not from God, and they say about God lies while they know","3:79":"It is not for any human being that God would give him the Book and the authority and the prophethood, then he would say to the people: \"Be servants to me rather than God!\" Rather: \"Be Devotees for what you have been taught of the Book, and of what you have studied","3:80":"Nor does He order you that you take the angels and the prophets as patrons. Would He order you to rejection after you have submitted","3:81":"And God took a covenant from the prophets: \"For what I have given you of the Book and wisdom, then a messenger will come to you authenticating what is with you. You will believe in him and support him.\" He said: \"Do you testify, and agree to this burden?\" They said: \"We testify.\" He said: \"Then bear witness, and I am with you bearing witness","3:82":"Whoever turns away after that, then they are the wicked","3:83":"Is it other than the system of God that they desire, when those in the heavens and the earth have submitted to Him voluntarily or by force? And to Him they will be returned","3:84":"Say: \"We believe in God and what was sent down to us and what was sent down to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Patriarchs, and what was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord. We do not make a distinction between any of them, and to Him we submit","3:85":"And whoever follows other than submission as a system, it will not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he is of the losers","3:86":"How can God guide a people who have rejected after believing, and they had witnessed that the messenger was true, and the clarity had come to them? God does not guide the wicked people","3:87":"To these the punishment will be that the curse of God will be upon them and that of the angels and the people all together","3:88":"Abiding therein, the retribution will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved","3:89":"Except those who repent after this and make amends, then God is Forgiver, Merciful","3:90":"Those who have rejected after their belief, then increased in rejection, their repentance will not be accepted, they are the strayers","3:91":"Those who have rejected and died while they were rejecters, if the earth full of gold were to be ransomed with it would not be accepted from any of them.

You wish to twist it while you are witnesses. And God is not unaware of what you do","3:100":"O you who believe, if you obey a group of those who received the Book they will turn you after your belief into rejecters","3:101":"And how can you reject when the revelations of God are being recited to you and with you is His messenger? And whoever holds firmly to God has been guided to the straight path","3:102":"O you who believe, reverence God as He deserves to be reverenced, and do not die except as ones who have submitted","3:103":"And hold firmly to the rope of God, all of you, and do not be separated. And remember the blessing of God upon you when you were enemies and He united your hearts. Then you became, with His blessing, brothers; and you were on the edge of a pit of fire and He saved you from it; it is thus that God clarifies for you His signs that you may be guided","3:104":"And let there be a nation from among you who calls towards goodness, and orders kindness, and prohibits vice. And these are the successful ones","3:105":"And do not be like those who separated and differed after the clarity had come to them. And for them is a painful retribution","3:106":"The Day on which faces will be lightened and faces will be darkened; as for those whose faces will be darkened: \"Did you reject after believing? Taste the retribution for what you rejected","3:107":"As for those whose faces will be lightened, they are in the mercy of God, in it they abide","3:108":"These are the revelations of God, We recite them to you with the truth. God does not want wickedness for the worlds","3:109":"And to God is all that is in the heavens and the earth; and to God all matters are returned","3:110":"You were the best nation that emerged for the people, you ordered kindness and prohibited vice, and believed in God. If the people of the Book believed it would have been better for them; from among them are the believers, but the majority are the wicked","3:111":"They will not harm you except in being an annoyance, and if they fight you they will turn and flee, then they will not be supported","3:112":"They are struck with humiliation wherever they are encountered, except for a rope from God and a rope from the people. And they stayed in the wrath of God and were struck with humiliation; that is because they were disbelieving in the revelations of God and killing the prophets without right; that is for what they disobeyed and were transgressing","3:113":"They are not all the same, from the people of the Book are a nation that is upright; they recite the revelations of God during the night hours and they prostrate","3:114":"They believe in God and the Last Day and order kindness and prohibit vice, and they hasten in goodness; these are of the good doers","3:115":"And what they do of good will not be turned back, and God is aware of the righteous","3:116":"As for those who rejected, neither their money nor their children will avail them anything from God. These are the people of the Fire, in it they abide","3:117":"The example of what they spend in this world is like a wind in which there is a frost; it afflicts the field of the people who wronged themselves, and thus destroys it. God did not wrong them, but it was their souls that they wronged","3:118":"O you who believe do not take as an inner-circle any from besides yourselves; they will only disrupt you greatly. They wish that you deviate; the hatred is apparent out of their mouths and what their chests conceal is even greater! We have made clear for you the signs if you comprehend","3:119":"Here you love them while they do not love you, and you believe in the entire Book. And if they meet you they say: \"We believe,\" and if they are alone they bite their fingers out of frustration at you. Say: \"Die in your frustration, God is aware of what is in the chests","3:120":"If any good befalls you it disturbs them, and if any bad befalls you they rejoice with it. And if you are patient and righteous their planning will not harm you at all. God is Encompassing all they do","3:121":"And as you departed from your family to prepare for the believers their stations for battle - and God is Hearer, Knowledgeable","3:122":"When two parties from among you were obsessed that they would fail; while God was their supporter. In God the believers should trust","3:123":"God had granted you victory at Badr, while you had been the lesser, so reverence God that you may be thankful","3:124":"When you said to the believers: \"Is it not enough for you that your Lord would supply you with three thousand of the angels sent down","3:125":"Indeed, if you are patient and are righteous and they come and attack you, He will supply you with five thousand of the angels battle trained","3:126":"And God did not give this except as good news to you, and so that your hearts may be assured with it. Victory is only from God, the Noble, the Wise","3:127":"Thus He will sever a group of those who reject, or disgrace them; then they will turn back frustrated","3:128":"You will have no say in the matter, for He may pardon them, or punish them; for they are wicked","3:129":"And to God is what is in the heavens and in the earth, He forgives whom He pleases, and He punishes whom He pleases; and God is Forgiving, Merciful","3:130":"O you who believe, do not consume usury, compounding over and over; and reverence God that you may succeed","3:131":"And be aware of the Fire that has been prepared for the rejecters","3:132":"And obey God and the messenger so that you may obtain mercy","3:133":"And race towards forgiveness from your Lord and a Paradise whose width encompasses the width of the heavens and of the earth; it has been prepared for the righteous","3:134":"The ones who spend in prosperity and hardship, and who repress anger, and who pardon the people; God loves the good doers","3:135":"And those who, if they commit lewdness, or wrong themselves, they remember God and seek forgiveness for their sins.

And they do not persist in what they have done while they know","3:136":"To these the recompense will be forgiveness from their Lord and estates with rivers flowing beneath them; abiding therein. Excellent is the recompense of the workers","3:137":"Many nations have come before you, so roam the earth and see how the punishment was for the deniers","3:138":"This is a clarification for the people and a reminder for the righteous","3:139":"Do not be weak, and do not grieve, for you will have the upper hand, if you are believers","3:140":"If you are wounded, then know that the other group is also wounded. And such are the days, We alternate them between the people, so that God will distinguish those who believe, and so He may make witnesses from among you; and God does not love the wicked","3:141":"And God will prove those who believe and He will condemn the rejecters","3:142":"Or did you think that you would enter the Paradise without God distinguishing those who would strive among you and distinguishing those who are patient","3:143":"And you used to long for death before you came upon it; so now you see it right in-front of you","3:144":"And Mohammed is but a messenger, like many messengers who have passed before him. If he dies or is killed will you turn back on your heels? And whoever turns back on his heels, he will not harm God in the least. And God will recompense the thankful","3:145":"It is not permitted for a soul to die except by the permission of God in an appointed record. And whoever wants the reward of this world We give him of it, and whoever wants the reward of the Hereafter, We give him of it. And We will reward the thankful","3:146":"And many a prophet had a large number of Devotees fighting with him. They did not waver by what afflicted them in the cause of God, nor did they become weak, nor did they become discouraged; and God loves the patient ones","3:147":"And they did not say except: \"Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our shortcomings in our responsibility, and make firm our foothold, and grant us victory over the rejecting people","3:148":"So God gave them the reward of this world and the best reward of the Hereafter; and God loves the good doers","3:149":"O you who believe, if you obey those who have rejected, then they will turn you back on your heels and you will turn back as losers","3:150":"It is God who is your Patron, and He is the best victor","3:151":"We will cast terror in the hearts of those who have rejected, because of what they have set up besides God while He never sent down any authority to do so, and their destiny is the Fire. Miserable is the abode of the wicked","3:152":"And God has fulfilled His promise to you, that you would overwhelm them with His permission; but then you failed and disputed in the matter and disobeyed after He showed you what you had sought. Some of you want this world, and some of you want the Hereafter. Then He let you retreat from them that He may test you; and He has pardoned you. God is with great grace over the believers","3:153":"For you were ascending to the high ground and would not even glance towards anyone, and the messenger was calling to you from behind. Therefore He gave you worry to replace your worry, so that you would not have sadness by what has passed you, or for what afflicted you, and God is Expert over what you do","3:154":"Then He sent down to you after the worry a tranquility in sleepiness, it overtook a group of you; and another group was obsessed with themselves, they were thinking about God other than the truth, the thoughts of the days of ignorance. They say: \"Why are we involved in this affair?\" Say: \"The entire affair is for God.\" They hide in their souls what they do not show to you, they say: \"If we had a say in this affair then none of us would have been killed here.\" Say: \"If you were inside your own homes, then the ones who had been marked for death would have come out to their resting place.\" God will test what is in your chests and bring out what is in your hearts. God is Knowledgeable as to what is in the chests","3:155":"Those of you who turned away on the day that the two hosts met, it was the devil who caused them to slip due to some of what they had earned. And God has pardoned them, for God is Forgiver, Compassionate","3:156":"O you who believe do not be like those who rejected and said to their brothers when they had gone forth in the land or on the offensive: \"If they were here with us they would not have died nor been killed.\" God will make this a source of grief in their hearts, and God grants life and death, and God is watching over what you do","3:157":"And if you are killed in the cause of God or die, then forgiveness from God and mercy are far greater than all they can put together","3:158":"And if you die or are killed, then to God you will be gathered","3:159":"It was a mercy from God that you were soft towards them; had you been harsh and hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from you; so pardon them and ask forgiveness for them, and consult them in the matter; but when you are convinced, then put your trust in God; for God loves those who put their trust","3:160":"If God grants you victory then none can defeat you, and if He abandons you then who can grant you victory after Him? And towards God the believers should put their trust","3:161":"It was not for any prophet to embezzle, and he who embezzles will be brought with what he has embezzled on the Day of Resurrection, then every soul will be given what it has earned without being wronged","3:162":"Is he who follows the pleasure of God as he who draws the wrath of God and his abode is Hell and a miserable destiny","3:163":"They are in grades with God, and God is Seer of what they do","3:164":"God has bestowed grace upon the believers by sending them a messenger from among themselves reciting His revelations and purifying them and teaching them the Book and the wisdom, and they were before in manifest darkness","3:165":"And so it was when you suffered setback; even though you afflicted them with twice as much setback; you said: \"Where is this coming from?\" Say: \"It is from yourselves.\" God is capable of all things","3:166":"And what you suffered on the day the two hosts met was with the permission of God, and to let the believers know","3:167":"And to let those who are hypocrites know, that they were told: \"Come fight in the cause of God or defend,\" they said: \"If we knew how to fight we would have followed you.\" They are closer to rejection than they are to belief. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts, and God is aware of what they conceal","3:168":"Those who remained and said to their brothers: \"If they obeyed us they would not have been killed.\" Say: \"Then avert death away from yourselves if you are truthful","3:169":"And do not think that those who are killed in the cause of God are dead. No, they are alive at their Lord receiving a bounty","3:170":"Happy with what God has granted them from His grace, and they rejoice in those who have yet to follow after them. There is no fear upon them nor do they grieve","3:171":"They rejoice with the bounty of God and grace; God will not waste the recompense of the believers","3:172":"Those who have answered God and the messenger after they were afflicted with wounds. For those of them who did good and were righteous is a great recompense","3:173":"The ones who the people said to them: \"The people have gathered against you, so be concerned by them,\" but it only increased their faith and they said: \"God is sufficient for us, and He is the best to put our trust in","3:174":"So they came back with a recompense from God and a bounty, no harm would touch them. And they had followed the pleasure of God, and God is the One with great pleasure","3:175":"It is only the devil trying to create fear for his allies, so do not fear them, but fear Me if you are believers","3:176":"And do not be saddened by those who rush into disbelief. They will not harm God in the least. God does not wish to make for them any share in the Hereafter, and they will have a painful retribution","3:177":"Those who have purchased rejection with belief will not harm God in the least, and they will have a painful retribution","3:178":"And let not those who reject think that We are providing for them out of the goodness of themselves. We are only providing for them so that they may increase in transgression, and they will have a humiliating retribution","3:179":"God was not to leave the believers as they were without distinguishing the rotten from the good. And God was not to let you know the future, but God chooses from His messengers whom He wishes; so believe in God and His messengers. And if you believe and are righteous, then you will have a great recompense","3:180":"And let not those who are stingy with what God has given them of His bounty think that it is good for them, no, it is evil for them. They will be surrounded by what they were stingy with on the Day of Resurrection. And to God will be the inheritance of the heavens and the earth; and God is Expert over what you do","3:181":"God has heard the words of those who said: \"God is poor and we are rich!\" We will record what they have said and their killing of the prophets without right; and We will say: \"Taste the retribution of the Fire","3:182":"This is for what their hands have delivered, and God does not wrong the servants","3:183":"Those who said: \"God has pledged to us that we should not believe in a messenger unless he brings us an offering which the fire will devour.\" Say: \"Messengers have come to you before me with clarity and with what you have said, so why did you kill them if you were truthful","3:184":"If they deny you, then messengers before you were also denied; they came with the proofs and the scriptures and the Book of Enlightenment","3:185":"Every soul will taste death, and you will be recompensed your dues on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is swayed from the Fire and entered into the Paradise, he has indeed won. This worldly life is nothing more than the enjoyment of vanity","3:186":"We will test you in your wealth and in yourselves, and you will hear from those who have been given the Book from before you and from the polytheists much annoyance. And if you are patient and righteous, then that is from a strength of conviction","3:187":"And God took the covenant of those who were given the Book: \"You will make it clear to the people and not conceal it.\" But they placed it behind their backs and purchased with it a cheap price. Miserable indeed is what they have purchased","3:188":"Do not think that those who are happy with what they have been given, and they love to be praised for what they did not do; do not think they are saved from the punishment.

To God is your return, all of you, and then He will inform you of what you have done","5:106":"O you who believe, witnessing shall be done if death is approaching one of you and a will is being made, by two among you who are equitable. If you have gone forth in the land, and death is approaching, then any two may suffice - if you have doubt regarding them, then detain them after making the contact prayer, and they will swear by God: \"We will not purchase with it any price, even if it was from a near relative, and we will not conceal the testimony of God, else we are of the sinners","5:107":"If it is then found that they had indeed incurred the sin, then two others, from those who have been named as beneficiaries, will take their place; and they will swear by God: \"Our testimony is more truthful than their testimony, and if we aggress, then we are of the wicked","5:108":"This is best as they are more likely to bring the testimony as intended, or face that their oaths would be disregarded as the previous oaths. And be aware of God, and listen; God does not guide the wicked people","5:109":"The Day God will gather the messengers and He will say: \"What was the response you received?\" They said: \"We have no knowledge, you are the Knower of all the unseen","5:110":"God said: \"O Jesus, son of Mary, recall My blessings upon you and your mother, that I supported you with the Holy Spirit; you spoke to the people in the cradle and middle-age; and I taught you the Book and the wisdom, and the Torah, and the Gospel; and you would create from clay the shape of a bird, then blow into it and it becomes a bird with My permission; and you would heal the blind and the leaper with My permission; and you would bring out the dead with My permission. And I have restrained the Children of Israel from you, that you came to them with proofs; but those who rejected among them said: 'This is clearly magic","5:111":"And I inspired the disciples: 'You shall believe in Me and My messenger;' they said: 'We believe, and bear witness that we have submitted","5:112":"And the disciples said: \"O Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord send down for us a feast from the heaven?\" He said: \"Be aware of God if you are believers","5:113":"They said: \"We want to eat from it and so our hearts become relieved, and so we know that you are truthful, and so that we can become a witness over it","5:114":"Jesus, son of Mary, said: \"Our god, our Lord, send downto us a feast from the heaven, that it becomes a joy to us from the first to the last, and a sign from You, and provide for us, you are the best provider","5:115":"God said: \"I will send it down to you, but whoever rejects after this from among you, I will punish him a punishment like no one else from the worlds will be punished","5:116":"And God will say: \"O Jesus, son of Mary, did you tell the people to take you and your mother as gods other than God?\" He said: \"Glory to you, I cannot say what I have no right of. If I had said it then You know it, You know what is in my self while I do not know what is in Your self. You are the Knower of the unseen","5:117":"I only said to them what You commanded me to say, that you shall serve God my Lord and your Lord; and I was witness over them as long as I was with them, but when You terminated my life, You were watcher over them. You are witness over all things","5:118":"If You punish them, then they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, then You are the Noble, the Wise","5:119":"God will say: \"This is a Day when the truth will benefit the truthful; they will have estates with rivers flowing beneath them, abiding therein eternally; God has become pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. Such is the greatest victory","5:120":"To God is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them; and He is capable of all things","6:1":"Praise be to God who has created the heavens and the earth, and Who made the darkness and the light; yet those who have rejected their Lord continue to deviate","6:2":"He is the One who has created you from clay, then He decreed a period of time for you; a time only known by Him. Yet you still deny","6:3":"And He is God in the heavens and the earth. He knows your secrets and what you reveal; and He knows what you earn","6:4":"And every sign that came to them from their Lord, they turned away from it","6:5":"They have denied the truth when it came to them. The news will ultimately come to them of what they were mocking","6:6":"Did they not see how many generations We have destroyed before them? We granted them dominance over the land more than what We granted you, and We sent the sky to them abundantly, and We made rivers flow beneath them; then, We destroyed them for their sins, and established after them a new generation","6:7":"And if We had sent down to you a book already written on paper, and they touched it with their own hands, then those who have rejected would say: \"This is but clear magic","6:8":"And they said: \"If only an angel were sent down to him?\" But if We had sent down an angel, the matter would be settled, then they would no longer be respited","6:9":"And had We sent an angel, We would have made him appear as a man, and We would have confounded them in what they already are confounded","6:10":"Messengers before you were mocked, but those who ridiculed suffered the consequences of that which they mocked","6:11":"Say: \"Roam the earth, then see what the punishment of the rejecters was","6:12":"Say: \"To whom is all that is in the heavens and the earth?\" Say: \"To God.\" He has decreed mercy on Himself, that He will gather you to the Day of Resurrection in which there is no doubt. Those who have lost their souls, they do not believe","6:13":"And for Him is what resides in the night and in the day; and He is the Hearer, the Knower","6:14":"Say: \"Shall I take other than God as an ally; the initiator of the heavens and the earth; while He feeds and is not fed!\" Say: \"I have been commanded to be the first who submits.\" And do not be of the polytheists","6:15":"Say: \"I fear if I disobey my Lord, the retribution of a great Day","6:16":"Whoever He spares from it, then He has had mercy on him; and that is the clear triumph","6:17":"And if God were to inflict you with harm, then none can remove it except He; and if He were to bless you with good, then He is capable of all things","6:18":"And He is the Supreme over His servants; and He is the Wise, the Expert","6:19":"Say: \"Which is the greatest testimony?\" Say: \"God is witness between me and you, and He has inspired to me this Qur'an that I may warn you with it and whoever it reaches, that you are bearing witness that with God are other gods!\" Say: \"I do not bear witness!\" Say: \"He is only One god, and I am innocent of what you have set up","6:20":"Those to whom We have given the Book know it as they know their children. Those who lost their souls, they do not believe","6:21":"And who is more wicked than he who invents lies about God, or denies His revelations! The wicked will never succeed","6:22":"And the Day We gather them all, then We say to the polytheists: \"Where are your partners whom you used to claim","6:23":"Then, their only excuse was to say: \"By God, our Lord, we were not polytheists","6:24":"See how they lied to themselves; and that which they invented abandoned them","6:25":"And from them are those who listen to you; and We have made covers over their hearts to prevent them from understanding it, and a deafness in their ears; and if they see every sign they will not believe; even when they come to you they argue, those who reject say: \"This is nothing except fictional tales of old","6:26":"And they prohibit others from it, and keep away themselves from it; but they will only destroy themselves, yet they do not notice","6:27":"And if you could see when they are standing over the Fire, they say: \"If only we could be sent back, we would not deny the revelations of our Lord, and we would be believers","6:28":"No, it is merely what they have been concealing that has now become evident to them; and if they were sent back they would return again to what they were prohibited from, they are but liars","6:29":"And they had said: \"There is only this worldly life, and we will not be resurrected","6:30":"And if you could see them when they are standing at their Lord; He said: \"Is this not the truth?\" They said: \"Yes, by our Lord,\" He said: \"Then taste the retribution for what you have rejected","6:31":"Losers are those who have denied their meeting with God; until the Hour comes to them suddenly, then they say: \"We deeply regret that which we have wasted in it,\" and they will carry their burdens on their backs; miserable indeed is their burden","6:32":"And the worldly life is nothing more than play and distraction, and the abode of the Hereafter is far better for those who are righteous. Do you not comprehend","6:33":"We know that you are saddened by what they say; they are not rejecting you, but it is the revelations of God which the wicked disregard","6:34":"Messengers before you were denied, but they were patient for what they were denied, and they were harmed until Our victory came to them; there is no changing the words of God. News of the messengers has come to you","6:35":"And if their aversion has become too much for you, then perhaps you could make a tunnel in the earth, or a ladder to the heavens, and bring them a sign. Had God willed, He would have gathered them to the guidance; so do not be of the ignorant ones","6:36":"Only those who listen will respond. As for the dead, God will resurrect them, then to Him they will return","6:37":"And they said: \"If only a sign was sent to him from his Lord!\" Say: \"God is able to send a sign, but most of them would not know","6:38":"And there is not a creature on the earth, nor a bird that flies with its wings, except they belong to nations like you belong. We did not leave anything out of the record; then to their Lord they will be gathered","6:39":"And those who deny Our revelations, they are deaf and dumb, in darkness. Whoever God wishes He misguides, and whoever He wishes He puts him on a straight path","6:40":"Say: \"We will see when the retribution of God comes to you, or the Hour comes to you, if you will still call on any other than God. If you are being truthful","6:41":"No, it is Him alone you will call on; and He will remove that which you called Him for, if He wills; and you will forget what you set up","6:42":"And We have sent others to nations before you. We then took them with adversity and hardship, perhaps they would implore","6:43":"If only they had implored when Our punishment came to them; but their hearts hardened, and the devil adorned for them what they used to do","6:44":"So when they forgot what they had been reminded of, We opened for them the gates of all opportunities; and when they were happy with what they were given, We took them suddenly! They were confounded","6:45":"It was thus that the remainder of the wicked people were wiped out; and praise be to God, Lord of the worlds","6:46":"Say: \"Do you see that if God were to take away your hearing and your eyesight, and He seals your hearts; which god besides God can bring it to you?\" See how We dispatch the signs, but then they turn away","6:47":"Say: \"Do you see if the retribution of God comes to you suddenly, or gradually, will anyone be destroyed except the wicked people","6:48":"And We do not send the messengers except as bearers of good news and warners; whoever believes, and does good, then there is no fear for them nor will they grieve","6:49":"And those who deny Our revelations, the retribution will inflict them for what wickedness they were in","6:50":"Say: \"I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of God, nor do I know the future, nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I merely follow what is inspired to me.\" Say: \"Are the blind and the seer the same? Do you not think","6:51":"And warn with it those who realize that they will be gathered to their Lord; they do not have besides Him any ally nor intercessor; perhaps they will be righteous","6:52":"And do not turn away those who call on their Lord at dawn and dusk seeking His face; you are not responsible for their judgment, nor are they responsible for your judgment; if you turn them away, then you will be of the wicked","6:53":"And it is such that We test them with one another, so that they may say: \"Are these the ones whom God has blessed from among us?\" Is God not aware of the thankful","6:54":"And if those who believe in Our revelations come to you, then say: \"Peace be upon you, our Lord has decreed mercy upon Himself, that any of you who commits sin out of ignorance and then repents afterwards and amends, then He is Forgiving, Merciful","6:55":"And it is such that We explain the revelations, and point out the way of the criminals","6:56":"Say: \"I am prohibited from serving those you call upon other than God\" Say: \"I will not follow your desires, otherwise I would go astray and I would not be of those guided","6:57":"Say: \"I am on a clarity from my Lord and you have denied it. I do not have what you hasten towards; the judgment is with God only; He narrates the truth, and He is the best decider","6:58":"Say: \"If I had what you were hastening towards, then the matter between us would have been resolved. And God is fully aware of the wicked","6:59":"And with Him are the keys of the unseen, none know them except He. And He knows what is in the land and in the sea; and not a leaf falls except He knows of it; nor a seed in the darkness of the earth; nor anything moist or anything dry; all in a clear record","6:60":"And He is the One who seizes you during the night, and He knows what you have done during the day, then He sends you back again to complete an appointed term; then to Him is your return and He will inform you of what you used to do","6:61":"And He is the Supreme over His servants, and He sends over you guardians. So that when the time of death comes to one of you, Our messengers terminate his life, and they do not neglect any","6:62":"Then they are returned to God, their true Patron; to Him is the judgment and He is the swiftest of reckoners","6:63":"Say: \"Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and the sea?\" You call on Him in humility and in secret: \"If You save us from this, we will be of the thankful","6:64":"Say: \"God will save you from it and from all distresses, yet you will still set up partners","6:65":"Say: \"He is able to send retribution from above you or from below your feet, or He will make you belong to opposing factions, then He will let you taste the might of each other.\" See how We dispatch the signs, perhaps they may understand","6:66":"And your people denied it, while it is the truth. Say: \"I am not a guardian over you","6:67":"For every news there is a time, and you will come to know","6:68":"And if you encounter those who make fun of Our revelations, then turn away from them until they move on to a different narrative; and if the devil makes you forget, then do not sit after remembering with the wicked people","6:69":"And those who are righteous are not responsible for their judgement, but to remind; perhaps they will be aware","6:70":"Leave alone those who have taken their system for play and distraction, and this worldly life has tempted them. And remind with it that a soul will suffer for what it has earned, it will not have besides God any supporter nor intercessor; and even if it brings all justice, none will be accepted from it. These are the ones who have suffered with what they have earned; for them will be a boiling drink, and a painful retribution for what they had rejected","6:71":"Say: \"Shall we call upon other than God what cannot benefit us or harm us, and we turn back on our heels after God has guided us?\" This is like the one whom the devils have managed to mislead on the earth, he is confused, having friends who call him to the guidance: \"Come to us!\" Say: \"The guidance is the guidance of God, and we have been ordered to submit to the Lord of the worlds","6:72":"And you shall hold the contact prayer, and be aware; and to Him you will be gathered","6:73":"And He is the One who has created the heavens and the earth with the truth, and the day He says: \"Be,\" then it is! His saying is truth; and to Him is the sovereignty the Day the horn is blown. Knower of the unseen and the seen; He is the Wise, the Expert","6:74":"And Abraham said to his father, Azar: \"Will you take statues as gods? I see you and your people are clearly misguided","6:75":"And it is such that We showed Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, so that he will be of those who have certainty","6:76":"When the night covered him, he saw a planet, and he said: \"This is my Lord.\" But when it disappeared he said: \"I do not like those who disappear","6:77":"So when he saw the moon rising, he said: \"This is my Lord.\" But when it disappeared he said: \"If my Lord does not guide me, then I will be among the wicked people","6:78":"So when he saw the sun rising, he said: \"This is my Lord, this is bigger.\" But when it disappeared he said: \"My people, I am innocent of what you have set up","6:79":"I shall turn my face to the One who initiated the heavens and the earth, in monotheism, and I am not of the polytheists","6:80":"And his people debated with him. He said: \"Do you debate with me regarding God, when He has guided me? I do not fear that which you have set up except if my Lord wills; my Lord encompasses all things in knowledge; will you not remember","6:81":"And how can I possibly fear what you have set up; yet you do not fear that you have set up partners with God, for which He has not sent down upon you any authority! So which of our two groups is more worthy of security if you know","6:82":"Those who believe and do not confound their belief with wrongdoing; they will have security, and they are guided","6:83":"And such was Our argument that We gave Abraham over his people; We raise the degree of whom We please. Your Lord is Wise, Knowledgeable","6:84":"And We granted him Isaac and Jacob, both of whom We guided; and Noah We guided from before; and from his progeny is David, and Solomon, and Job, and Joseph, and Moses, and Aaron. It is such that We recompense the good doers","6:85":"And Zachariah and John, and Jesus, and Elias; all were from the upright","6:86":"And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot; and each We have preferred over the worlds","6:87":"And from their fathers and their progeny and their brothers We have also chosen; and We guided them to a straight path","6:88":"Such is the guidance of God, He guides with it whom He pleases of His servants. And if they set up partners, then all that they had worked would fall away from them","6:89":"Those to whom We have given the Book, and the law, and the prophethood, if they reject it, then We will entrust it to a people who will not reject it","6:90":"These are the ones guided by God; so let their guidance be an example. Say: \"I do not ask you for any wage; this is but a reminder for the worlds","6:91":"And they did not appreciate God as He deserves to be appreciated, for they said: \"God has never sent down anything to any human being.\" Say: \"Who then has sent down the Book which Moses had come with, a light and a guidance for the people? You treat it simply as paper for display, and you conceal much; and you were taught what neither you nor your fathers knew.\" Say: \"God has.\" Then leave them playing in their folly","6:92":"And this is a Book which We have sent down, blessed, authenticating what is between his hands, and that you may warn the capital of the towns and those around it. And those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they maintain their contact prayer","6:93":"And who is more wicked than he who invents lies about God, or says: \"It has been inspired to me,\" when We did not inspire anything to him; or who says: \"I will bring down the same as what God has sent down.\" And if you could only see the wicked at the moments of death when the angels have their arms opened: \"Bring yourselves out, today you will be given the severest punishment for what you used to say about God without truth, and you used to be arrogant towards His revelations","6:94":"And you have come to Us individually, just as We had created you the first time; and you have left behind you all that We have provided for you; and We do not see your intercessors with you that you used to claim were with you in partnership; all is severed between you, and what you have claimed has abandoned you","6:95":"God is the splitter of the seeds and the grains; He brings the living out from the dead and He brings the dead out from the living. Such is God; so why are you deluded","6:96":"Initiator of the morning and Maker of the night to reside in; and the sun and the moon for counting. Such is the measure of the Noble, the Knowledgeable","6:97":"And He is the One who made for you the stars, to guide you by them in the darkness of the land and the sea. We have explained the signs to a people who know","6:98":"And He is the One who initiated you from one person; with a place for stability and development. We have explained the signs to a people who understand","6:99":"And He is the One who sent down water from the heaven, and We brought out with it plants of every kind. We brought out from it the green, from which We bring out multiple seeds; and what is from the palm trees, from its sheaths hanging low and near; and gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates, similar and not similar. Look at its fruit when it blossoms and its ripeness. In this are signs for a people who believe","6:100":"And they set up partners with God from among the Jinn, while He had created them. And they invented for Him sons and daughters without them having any knowledge! Be He glorified and exalted above what they describe","6:101":"Originator of the heavens and the earth, how can He have a son when He did not take a wife? And He created all things and He is knowledgeable in all things","6:102":"Such is God, your Lord, there is no god except He; creator of all things, so serve Him. And He is Caretaker over all things","6:103":"The eyesight cannot reach Him, yet He can reach all eyesight; and He is the Subtle, the Expert","6:104":"Visible proofs have come to you from your Lord; so whoever can see, does so for himself, and whoever is blinded, will be such. I am not a watcher over you","6:105":"It is thus that We dispatch the signs and that they may say: \"You have studied,\" and We will make it clear for a people who know","6:106":"Follow what is inspired to you from your Lord; there is no god except He, and turn away from the polytheists","6:107":"And if God had willed, they would not have set up partners. And We did not place you over them as a guardian, nor are you over them as a sponsor","6:108":"And do not insult those who call on other than God, lest they insult God out of ignorance. And We have similarly adorned for every nation their works; then to their Lord is their return and He will inform them of what they had done","6:109":"And they swore by God using their strongest oaths; that if a sign came to them they would believe in it. Say: \"The signs are from God; and how do you know that once it comes, that they will not disbelieve","6:110":"And We divert their hearts and eyesight, as they did not believe in it the first time; and We leave them wandering in their transgression","6:111":"And if We had sent down to them the angels, and the dead spoke to them, and We had gathered before them everything, they still would not believe except if God wills. Alas, most of them are ignorant","6:112":"And as such, We have permitted the enemies of every prophet — mankind and Jinn devils — to inspire each other with fancy words in order to deceive. Had your Lord willed, they would not have done it. You shall disregard them and their fabrications","6:113":"That is so the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter will listen to it, and they will accept it, and they will take of it what they will","6:114":"Shall I seek other than God as a judge when He has sent down to you the Book fully detailed?\" Those to whom We have given the Book know it is sent down from your Lord with the truth; so do not be of those who have doubt","6:115":"And the word of your Lord has been completed with truth and justice; there is no changing His words. He is the Hearer, the Knower","6:116":"And if you obey most of those on the earth they will lead you away from the path of God; that is because they follow conjecture, and that is because they only guess","6:117":"Your Lord is fully aware of who strays from His path, and He is fully aware of the guided ones","6:118":"So eat from that on which the name of God has been mentioned, if you indeed believe in His revelations","6:119":"And why should you not eat that on which the name of God has been mentioned, when He has fully detailed to you what has been made unlawful; except what you are forced to? Many misguide by their desires without knowledge; your Lord is fully aware of the transgressors","6:120":"And leave alone, publicly and privately, that which is a sin; those who earn sin will be punished for what they have taken","6:121":"And do not eat from that which the name of God has not been mentioned, for it is wickedness. And the devils they inspire their supporters to argue with you; and if you obey them, then you are polytheists","6:122":"Is he who was dead and to whom We gave life, and We made for him a light to walk with among the people, as he whose example is in darkness and he will not exit from it? It is such that the work of the rejecters has been adorned for them","6:123":"And as such, We have permitted in every town the influential from its criminals, to scheme in it. They only scheme their own souls without perceiving","6:124":"And if a sign comes to them they say: \"We will not believe until we are given the same as what the messengers of God were given!\" God is fully aware of where He makes His message; those criminals will have debasement with God and a painful retribution for what they had schemed","6:125":"Whoever God wishes to guide, He will comfort his chest to submission; and whoever He wishes to misguide, He will make his chest tight and constricted, as one who is ascending towards the heaven. It is such that God lets taint those who do not believe","6:126":"And this is the straight path of your Lord. We have fully detailed the revelations to a people who remember","6:127":"They will have the abode of peace with their Lord; He is their supporter because of what they used to do","6:128":"And the Day We gather them all: \"O assembly of Jinn, you have managed to take many from mankind.\" Their supporters from mankind said: \"Our Lord, we have indeed enjoyed one another, and we have reached our destiny to which You delayed us.\" He said: \"The Fire is your dwelling, abiding therein, except as your Lord wishes.\" Your Lord is Wise, Knowledgeable","6:129":"It is such that We make the wicked as supporters to one another for what they have earned","6:130":"O assembly of Jinn and mankind, did not messengers come to you from among you and tell to you My revelations, and warn you of the meeting of this Day?\" They said: \"Yes, we bear witness upon ourselves;\" and the worldly life deceived them, and they bore witness upon themselves that they were rejecters","6:131":"That is because your Lord was not to destroy any town because of its wickedness while its people were unaware","6:132":"But there are degrees for what they had done; and your Lord is not unaware of what they do","6:133":"And your Lord is the Rich, possessor of Mercy. If He wished, He could remove all of you and bring after you whom He pleases, just as He established you from the seed of another people","6:134":"What you have been promised will come, you cannot escape it","6:135":"Say: \"My people, work as you see fit, for I too am working. You will then know to whom will be the punishment of the Hereafter. The wicked will not succeed","6:136":"And they made for God a portion of what He provided them from the crops and the livestock; they said: \"This is for God,\" by their claims, \"And this is for our partners.\" So what was for their partners did not reach God, and what was for God, it reached their partners! Miserable is how they judged","6:137":"And it was adorned for the polytheists, by their partners, to kill their children in order to turn them and to confound their system for them. Had God willed they would not have done this, so ignore them and what they invent","6:138":"And they said: \"These livestock and crops are reserved, and none shall eat from them except as we please,\" by their claims; and livestock whose backs are unlawful, and livestock over which they do not mention the name of God as an innovation against Him. He will recompense them for what they invented","6:139":"And they said: \"What is in the bellies of these livestock is purely for our males and unlawful for our wives, and if comes out dead, then they will be partners in it.\" God will recompense them for what they describe. He is Wise, Knowledgeable","6:140":"Losers are those who have killed their children foolishly, without knowledge, and they forbade what God had granted them by lying about God. They have strayed and they were not guided","6:141":"And He is the One Who initiated gardens; both trellised and untrellised; and palm trees, and plants, all with different taste; and olives and pomegranates, similar and not similar. Eat from its fruit when it blossoms and give its due on the day of its harvest; and do not waste. He does not like the wasteful","6:142":"And from the livestock are those for burden, and also for clothing. Eat from what God has provided you and do not follow the footsteps of the devil; he is to you a clear enemy","6:143":"Eight in pairs: from the lambs two, and from the goats two. Say: \"Is it the two males that He forbade or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females bore? Inform me if you are truthful","6:144":"And from the camels two, and from the cattle two. Say: \"Is it the two males that He forbade or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females bore?

Their blame is with God, but most of them do not know","7:132":"And they said: \"No matter what you bring us of a sign to bewitch us with, we will never believe in you","7:133":"So We sent them the flood, and the locust, and the lice, and the frogs, and the blood; all detailed signs; but they turned arrogant, they were a criminal people","7:134":"And when the affliction befell them, they said: \"O Moses, call on your Lord for what He has pledged with you, that if you remove this affliction from us, then we will believe in you and we will send with you the Children of Israel","7:135":"So when We removed from them the affliction, until a future time, they broke their pledge","7:136":"We thus took vengeance upon them by drowning them in the sea, for their denial of Our signs, and their disregard of them","7:137":"And We let the people who were weak inherit the east of the land and the west of it which We have blessed.

When he awoke, he said: \"Glory to You, I repent to You and I am the first of those who believe","7:144":"He said: \"O Moses, I have chosen you over the people with My message and My words; so take what I have given you and be of the thankful","7:145":"And We wrote for him on the tablets from all things a lesson, and detailing all things.

The One who has the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, there is no god except He; He gives life and causes death.\" So believe in God and His Gentile messenger prophet, who believes in God and His words; and follow him that you may be guided","7:159":"And from among the people of Moses are a nation who guide with the truth and with it they become just","7:160":"And We separated them into twelve patriarch nations; and We inspired Moses when his people wanted to drink: \"Strike the stone with your staff,\" thus twelve springs burst out of it. Each people then knew from where to drink. And We shaded them with clouds and We sent down to them manna and quail: \"Eat from the good things that We have provided for you.\" They did not wrong Us, but it was their souls that they wronged","7:161":"And they were told: \"Reside in this town and eat from it as you please, and say: \"Our load is removed,\" and enter the passageway by crouching, We will forgive for you your wrongdoings, and We will increase for the good doers","7:162":"Those who were transgressors among them altered what was said to them with something different; so We sent to them an affliction from the heaven for what transgression they were in","7:163":"And ask them about the town which was by the sea, after they had transgressed the Sabbath; their fish would come to them openly on the day of their Sabbath, and when they are not in Sabbath, they do not come to them! It is such that We afflicted them for what wickedness they were in","7:164":"And a nation from among them said: \"Why do you preach to a people whom God will destroy or punish a painful retribution?\" They said: \"A plea to your Lord, and perhaps they may be aware","7:165":"So when they forgot that which they were reminded of, We saved those who prohibited wickedness, and We took those who transgressed with a grievous retribution for what wickedness they were in","7:166":"So when they persisted in that which they had been prohibited from, We said to them: \"Be despicable apes","7:167":"And your Lord has sworn that He will send upon them, until the Day of Resurrection, people who would inflict severe punishments on them. Your Lord is swift to punish, and He is Forgiving, Merciful","7:168":"And We divided them through the land as nations. From them are the upright, and from them are other than that. And We tested them with good things and bad, perhaps they will return","7:169":"Then, a generation came after them who inherited the Book, but they opted for the materialism of that which is lower; and they say: \"It will be forgiven for us.\" And they continue to opt for the materialism if it comes to them; was not the covenant of the Book taken on them that they would only say the truth about God, and they studied what was in it? And the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are aware. Do you not comprehend","7:170":"As for those who hold fast to the Book, and they hold the contact prayer; We will not waste the reward of the righteous","7:171":"And We raised the mountain above them as if it were a cloud, and they thought it would fall on them: \"Take what We have given you with strength and remember what is in it that you may be righteous","7:172":"And your Lord took for the children of Adam from their backs, their progeny; and He made them witness over themselves: \"Am I not your Lord?\" They said: \"Yes, we bear witness.\" Thus you cannot say on the Day of Resurrection that you were unaware of this","7:173":"Nor can you say: \"It was our fathers who set up partners before and we were simply a progeny who came after them. Would You destroy us for what the innovators did","7:174":"It is such that We explain the revelations, perhaps they will return","7:175":"And recite to them the news of the person whom Our revelations were given to him, but he removed himself from them, and thus the devil followed him, and He became of those who went astray","7:176":"And if We had wished, We could have raised him with it, but he stuck to the earth and he followed his desire. His example is like the dog, if you scold him he pants, and if you leave him he pants; such is the example of the people who deny Our revelations. So tell the stories, perhaps they will think","7:177":"Miserable is the example of the people who denied Our revelations, and it was their souls that they had wronged","7:178":"Whoever God guides, then he is the guided one; and whoever He misguides, then these are the losers","7:179":"And We have given to Hell many of the Jinn and mankind; they had hearts with which they did not understand, and they had eyes with which they did not see, and they had ears with which they did not hear. They are like livestock; no, they are even more astray. These are the unaware ones","7:180":"And to God belong the most beautiful names, so call Him by them; and leave alone those who deviate His names. They will be punished for what they used to do","7:181":"And from among those We created is a nation who guides with the truth, and with it they are just","7:182":"As for those who deny Our revelations, We will entice them from where they do not know","7:183":"And I will encourage them, for My planning is formidable","7:184":"Do they not reflect? Their companion has no madness; but he is a clear warner","7:185":"Have they not looked at the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and all that God has created? Perhaps their time is drawing near; so in which narrative after this one will they believe","7:186":"Whoever God misguides, then there is none to guide him; and He leaves them blindly wandering in their transgression","7:187":"They ask you regarding the Hour: \"When will be its time?\" Say: \"Its knowledge is with my Lord, none can reveal its coming except He. It is heavy through the heavens and the earth; it will not come to you except suddenly.\" They ask you, as if you are responsible for it! Say: \"Its knowledge is with God, but most of the people do not know","7:188":"Say: \"I do not possess for myself any benefit or harm, except what God wills. And if I could know the future, then I would have increased my good fortune, and no harm would have come to me. I am but a warner and a bearer of good news to a people who believe","7:189":"He is the One who has created you from one person, and He made from it its mate to reside with. When he dwelled with her, she became pregnant with a light load, and she continued with it; then when it became heavy, they called on God, their Lord: \"If You give us an upright child, then we will be among the thankful","7:190":"But when He gave them an upright child, they set up partners with Him in what He had given them. God be exalted above what they set up as partners","7:191":"Do they set up those who do not create anything, while they are created","7:192":"And they cannot give them aid, nor can they aid themselves","7:193":"And if you invite them to the guidance they will not follow you. It is the same whether you invite them or simply keep quiet","7:194":"Those whom you call on besides God are servants like you; so let them answer for you if you are truthful","7:195":"Do they have feet with which to walk? Or, do they have hands with which to strike? Or, do they have eyes with which to see? Or, do they have ears with which to hear? Say: \"Call on your partners, then plan against me. You will not be given respite","7:196":"My supporter is God who sent down the Book; and He takes care of the righteous","7:197":"As for those whom you call on besides Him, they cannot aid you, nor can they aid themselves","7:198":"And when you invite them to the guidance, they do not listen. And you see them looking at you, while they do not see","7:199":"Take to pardoning, and order what is good, and turn away from the ignorant ones","7:200":"And if bitterness from the devil afflicts you, then seek refuge with God. He is the Hearer, the Knower","7:201":"Those who are pious, when any evil from the devil touches them, they remember, then they can see","7:202":"And their brethren attempt to drive them towards error, they do not cease","7:203":"And because you do not bring them a sign, they say: \"If only you had brought one.\" Say: \"I only follow what is inspired to me from my Lord. This is an evidence from your Lord, and a guide and mercy to a people who believe","7:204":"And if the Qur'an is being read, then listen to it and pay attention, that you may receive mercy","7:205":"And remember your Lord within yourself, in humility and in reverence; and without loudness in words, during the morning and the evening. And do not be of the careless ones","7:206":"Those who are at your Lord, they are never too proud to serve Him, and they glorify Him, and to Him they yield","8:1":"They ask you regarding the spoils, say: \"The spoils are for God and the messenger.\" So be aware of God, and be upright in matters between you; and obey God and His messenger if you are believers","8:2":"The believers are those whom, when God is mentioned, their hearts reverence; and when His revelations are recited to them, it increases their faith; and they put their trust in their Lord","8:3":"They hold the contact prayer, and from Our provisions to them they spend","8:4":"These are the true believers; they will have grades with their Lord and a forgiveness and a generous provision","8:5":"As your Lord made you go out from your home with the truth, but a party from among the believers disliked this","8:6":"They argue with you about the truth when it has been made clear to them; as if they were being herded towards death while they are watching","8:7":"And God promises you that one of the two parties will be defeated by you; and you wish that the one least armed be the one. But God wishes that the truth be manifest with His words, and that He eliminates the remnant of the rejecters","8:8":"So that the truth will be manifest, and the falsehood will be finished; even if the criminals hate it","8:9":"You called on help from your Lord and He answered you: \"I will provide you with one thousand angels as defenders","8:10":"And God did not do this except to give you good news, and that your hearts may be assured by it. And victory is only from God; for God is Noble, Wise","8:11":"Sleep overcame you to give you tranquility from Him; and He sent down to you water from the sky to cleanse you with it and cause the affliction of the devil to leave you; and so that He may strengthen your hearts and set firm your feet","8:12":"Your Lord inspired to the angels: \"I am with you so keep firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who have rejected; so strike above the necks, and strike from them every one standing","8:13":"That is because they have transgressed against God and His messenger. And whoever transgresses against God and His messenger, then God is severe in retribution","8:14":"This is for you to sample, and for the rejecters will be a retribution of Fire","8:15":"O you who believe; when you encounter those who have rejected on the battlefield, do not flee from them","8:16":"And whoever on that day flees from them; unless it is part of the battle strategy or if he is retreating back to his group; then he has drawn the wrath of God upon him, and his abode will be Hell. What a miserable destiny","8:17":"It was not you who killed them, but it was God who killed them. And it was not you who launched when you did, but it was God who launched. And so that the believers would be tested well by Him. God is Hearer, Knowledgeable","8:18":"That, and God weakens the plans of the rejecters","8:19":"If you sought conquest, then conquest has come to you, but if you cease, then it is better for you. And if you return again, then We will also return, and your group will avail you nothing even if it is many. God is with the believers","8:20":"O you who believe, obey God and His messenger, and do not turn away from him while you have heard","8:21":"And do not be like those who have said: \"We hear,\" but they do not hear","8:22":"The worst creatures with God are the deaf and dumb who do not comprehend","8:23":"And if God had found any good in them, then He would have made them listen. And if He had made them listen, they would have turned away while they are in aversion","8:24":"O you who believe, answer the call of God and His messenger when he calls you to what will grant you life. And know that God comes between a person and his heart, and that to Him you will be gathered","8:25":"And be aware of a test that will not only afflict those of you who were wicked; and know that God is severe in retribution","8:26":"And remember when you were but a few who were weak in the land, you were fearful that the people might capture you. But He sheltered you, and He supported you with His victory, and He provided you with good provisions, so that you may be thankful","8:27":"O you who believe, do not betray God and the messenger, nor betray your trust, while you know","8:28":"And know that your money and your children are a test, and that God has the greatest reward","8:29":"O you who believe, if you are aware of God, He will make a criterion for you, and He will cancel your sins and forgive you. God is possessor of great grace","8:30":"And the rejecters plot against you to arrest you, or to kill you, or to expel you. And they plot, and God plots, and God is the best of plotters","8:31":"And if Our revelations are recited to them, they say: \"We have listened, and if we wish, we could have said the same thing. This is nothing except fictional tales of old","8:32":"And they said: \"Our god, if this is the truth from You, then send down upon us a rain of stones from the heaven or bring upon us a painful retribution","8:33":"And God will not punish them while you are with them, nor will God punish them while they continue to seek forgiveness","8:34":"And why should God not punish them when they are turning others away from the Restricted Temple, and they were never its protectors! Its protectors are the righteous; but most of them do not know","8:35":"And their contact prayer at the Sanctuary was nothing but noise and aversion. Taste the retribution for what you have rejected","8:36":"Those who have rejected, they spend their money to turn others away from the path of God. They will spend it, then it will become an anguish for them, then they will be defeated. Those who have rejected will be gathered to Hell","8:37":"This is so that God will distinguish the bad from the good, and so that the bad will be gathered together into one heap then He will cast it all into Hell. These are the losers","8:38":"Say to the rejecters: \"If they cease, then what has passed before will be forgiven to them, and if they return to it, then the example of the previous generations has already been given","8:39":"And fight them all until there is no more oppression, and the entire system is for God. But if they cease, then God is Seer over what they do","8:40":"And if they turn away, then know that God is your Patron. What an excellent Patron, and what an excellent Victor","8:41":"And know that anything you profit, one-fifth shall go to God and the messenger, and the relatives, and the orphans, and the poor, and the wayfarer. You will do this if you believe in God and in what We revealed to Our servant on the Day of the Criterion, the day the two armies clashed; and God is capable of all things","8:42":"When you were on the near side, and they were on the far side, then the supply line became directly beneath you. And if you had planned for this meeting, you would have disagreed on its timing, but God was to enforce a command that was already done. So that He would destroy those to be destroyed with proof, and to let those who will live be alive with proof; and God is Hearer, Knowledgeable","8:43":"God showed them to you as being few in your dream, and if He had shown them to you to be many, then you would have failed and you would have disputed in the matter, but God saved you. He is the Knower of what is in the chests","8:44":"And He showed them to you when you met as being few to your eyes, and He made you appear as being fewer to their eyes. That was so the decree of God would come to be; and to God all matters are returned","8:45":"O you who believe, when you meet a force, stand firm and mention God excessively, that you may succeed","8:46":"And obey God and His messenger, and do not dispute else you will fail and your momentum will depart, and be patient. God is with the patient","8:47":"And do not be like those who came out from their homes to boast and to be seen by the people, and they repel others from the path of God; and God is aware of what they do","8:48":"And the devil adorned their work for them, and he said: \"No people can defeat you today, and I am by your side.\" But when the two forces came together, he turned back on his heels and he said: \"I am innocent from you! I see what you do not see. I fear God, and God is severe in punishment","8:49":"The hypocrites and those who have a disease in their hearts said: \"These people have been deceived by their system.\" But whoever puts his trust in God, then God is Noble, Wise","8:50":"And if you could only see as the angels terminate the lives of those who have rejected, they strike their faces and their backs: \"Taste the punishment of the blazing Fire","8:51":"This is for what your hands have delivered, and God does not wrong the servants","8:52":"Like the behavior of the people of Pharaoh, and those before them; they rejected the signs of God, so God took them by their sins. God is Strong, severe in punishment","8:53":"That is because God was not to change any blessing He bestowed upon a people, unless they change what is in themselves. God is Hearer, Knowledgeable","8:54":"Like the behavior of the people of Pharaoh, and those before them; they denied the signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them by their sins, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh; all of them were wicked","8:55":"The worst creatures to God are those who reject, for they do not believe","8:56":"Those of them with whom you made a pledge, then they break their pledge every time, and they do take heed","8:57":"So, when you encounter them in battle, set them as an example for those who will come after them; perhaps they may remember","8:58":"And if you are being betrayed by a people, then you shall likewise move against them. God does not love the betrayers","8:59":"And let not those who have rejected think that they have escaped; they will never avail themselves","8:60":"And prepare for them all that you can of might, and from the steeds of war, that you may instill terror with it towards the enemy of God and your enemy, and others besides them whom you do not know but God knows them. And whatever you spend in the cause of God will be returned to you, and you will not be wronged","8:61":"And if they seek peace, then you also seek it, and put your trust in God. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable","8:62":"And if they wish to deceive you, then God is sufficient for you. He is the One who supported you with His victory and with the believers","8:63":"And He made unity between their hearts. And if you had spent all that is on the earth, you would not have united between their hearts, but God united between them. He is Noble, Wise","8:64":"O prophet, God is sufficient for you,and whoever followed you from the believers","8:65":"O prophet, urge the believers to fight. If there are twenty of you who are patient, they will defeat two hundred. And if there are one hundred of you, they will defeat one thousand from among those who reject; that is because they are a people who do not understand","8:66":"Now, God has alleviated for you, for He knows that there is weakness in you. If there are one hundred of you who are patient, they will defeat two hundred. And if there are one thousand of you, they will defeat two thousand with the permission of God. God is with the patient","8:67":"And it was not for any prophet to take prisoners until he is bound by a campaign. You desire the materials of this world, while God wants the Hereafter for you. God is Noble, Wise","8:68":"Had it not been previously ordained from God, then a severe punishment would have afflicted you for what you took","8:69":"So consume what you have gained, lawful and good, and be aware of God. God is Forgiving, Merciful","8:70":"O prophet, say to those prisoners whom you hold: \"If God finds in your hearts any good, He will grant you better than what He took from you, and He will forgive you. God is Forgiving, Merciful","8:71":"And if they want to betray you, then they had already betrayed God before, but He has overpowered them; and God is Knowledgeable, Wise","8:72":"Those who have believed and emigrated and strived with their money and lives in the cause of God, and those who have sheltered and supported; these are the allies of one another. And those who believed but did not emigrate, you do not owe them any obligation until they emigrate. But if they seek your help in the system, then you must support them, except if it is against a people with whom there is a covenant between you and them. And God is Seer over what you do","8:73":"As for those who reject, they are allies to one another. If you do not do this, then there will be oppression on the earth and great corruption","8:74":"And those who have believed and emigrated and strived in the cause of God, and those who have sheltered and supported, these are truly the believers. They will have a forgiveness and a generous provision","8:75":"And those who believed afterwards and emigrated and strived with you, then they are from you. And the relatives by birth are also supportive of one another in the Book of God. God is aware of all things","9:1":"A revocation is made by God and His messenger to those with whom you have made a pledge from among the polytheists","9:2":"Therefore, roam the land for four months and know that you will not escape God, and that God will humiliate the rejecters","9:3":"And a proclamation from God and His messenger to the people, on the greater Pilgrimage day: \"That God and His messenger are innocent from the polytheists.\" If you repent, then it is better for you, and if you turn away, then know that you will not escape God. And give news to those who have rejected of a painful retribution","9:4":"Except for those with whom you had made a pledge from among the polytheists if they did not reduce anything from it nor did they support anyone against you; you shall continue the pledge with them until its expiry. God loves the righteous","9:5":"So when the restricted months have passed, then you may kill the polytheists wherever you find them, and take them, and surround them, and stand against them at every point. If they repent, and they hold the contact prayer, and they contribute towards purification, then you shall leave them alone. God is Forgiving, Merciful","9:6":"And if any of the polytheists seeks your protection, then you may protect him so that he may hear the words of God, then let him reach his sanctity. This is because they are a people who do not know","9:7":"How can the polytheists have a pledge with God and with His messenger? Except for those with whom you made a pledge near the Restricted Temple, as long as they are upright with you, then you are upright with them. God loves the righteous","9:8":"How is it that when they come upon you they disregard all ties, either those of kinship or of pledge. They seek to please you with their words, but their hearts deny, and the majority of them are wicked","9:9":"They purchased with the revelations of God a cheap price, so they repel others from His path. Evil indeed is what they used to do","9:10":"They do not respect those who are believers, nor a kinship, nor a pledge. These are the transgressors","9:11":"If they repent, and they hold the contact prayer, and they contribute towards purification, then they are your brothers in the system. We explain the revelations for a people who know","9:12":"And if they break their oaths after making their pledge, and they challenge the authority of your system; then you may kill the leaders of rejection. Their oaths are nothing to them, perhaps they will then cease","9:13":"Would you not fight a people who broke their oaths, and obsessed to expel the messenger, especially while they were the ones who attacked you first? Are you concerned about them? It is God who is more deserving that you be concerned with if you are believers","9:14":"Fight them; perhaps God will punish them by your hands and humiliate them and grant you victory over them and heal the chests of the believing people","9:15":"And to remove the anger from their hearts; God pardons whom he pleases. God is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:16":"Or did you think that you would be left alone? God will come to distinguish those of you who strived and did not take other than God and His messenger and the believers as helpers. God is Expert in what you do","9:17":"It was not for the polytheists to maintain the temples of God while they bear witness over their own rejection. For these, their works have fallen, and in the Fire they will abide","9:18":"Rather, the temples of God are maintained by he who believes in God and the Last Day, and he upholds the contact prayer, and he contributes towards purification, and is only concerned by God. It is these that will be of the guided ones","9:19":"Have you made the watering of the pilgrim and the maintenance of the Restricted Temple the same as one who believes in God and the Last Day and he strives in the cause of God? They are not the same with God. And God does not guide the wicked people","9:20":"Those who believed and emigrated and strived in the cause of God with their money and their lives are in a greater degree with God. These are the winners","9:21":"Their Lord gives them good news of a mercy from Him, and acceptance, and gardens that are for them in which there is permanent bliss","9:22":"Abiding therein eternally. With God there is a great reward","9:23":"O you who believe, do not take your fathers nor brothers as allies if they prefer rejection to belief. And whoever of you takes them as such, then these are the wicked","9:24":"Say: \"If your fathers, and your sons, and your brothers, and your wives, and your kin, and money which you have gathered, and a trade which you would be concerned over its decline, and homes which you find pleasing; if these are dearer to you than God and His messenger and striving in His cause, then wait until God brings His decision. And God does not guide the wicked people","9:25":"God has granted you victory in many battlefields. And on the day of Hunayn when you were pleased with your great numbers but it did not help you at all, and the land became tight around you for what it held, then you turned to flee","9:26":"Then God sent down His tranquility upon His messenger and the believers, and He sent down soldiers which you did not see, and He punished those who rejected. Such is the recompense of the rejecters","9:27":"Then God will accept the repentance of whom He pleases after that. God is Forgiving, Merciful","9:28":"O you who believe, the polytheists are impure, so let them not approach the Restricted Temple after this year of theirs; and if you fear poverty, then God will enrich you from His blessings if He wills. God is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:29":"Fight those who do not believe in God or the Last Day, nor do they restrict what God and His messenger have restricted, nor do they uphold the system of truth; from among the people who have been given the Book; until they pay the reparation, willingly or unwillingly, and they are subdued","9:30":"The Jews said: \"Ezra is the son of God,\" and the Nazarenes said: \"The Messiah is the son of God.\" Such is their utterances with their mouths, they imitate the sayings of those who rejected before them. God will fight them. They are deluded from the truth","9:31":"They have taken their Priests and Monks to be patrons besides God, and the Messiah, son of Mary, while they were only commanded to serve One god, there is no god except He, be He glorified against what they set up","9:32":"They want to extinguish the light of God with their mouths, but God refuses such and lets His light continue, even if the rejecters hate it","9:33":"He is the One who has sent His messenger with the guidance and the system of truth, so that it will expose all other systems, even if the polytheists hate it","9:34":"O you who believe, many of the Priests and Monks consume the money of the people in falsehood, and they repel from the path of God. And those who hoard gold and silver, and do not spend it in the cause of God, give them news of a painful retribution","9:35":"On the Day when they will be seared in the fires of Hell, and their foreheads and sides and backs will be branded with it: \"This is what you have hoarded for yourselves, so taste what you have hoarded","9:36":"The count of the months with God is twelve months in the book of God the day He created the heavens and the earth; four of them are restricted. This is the correct system; so do not wrong yourselves in them; and fight the polytheists collectively as they fight you collectively. And know that God is with the righteous","9:37":"Know that the use of the additional month causes an increase in rejection, for it is used by those who have rejected that they may misguide with it by making it lawful one year, and forbidden one year, so as to circumvent the count of what God has made restricted; thus they make lawful what God has made forbidden. Their evil works have been adorned for them, and God does not guide the rejecting people","9:38":"O you who believe, what is wrong with you when you are told: \"Mobilize in the cause of God,\" you become heavy on the earth. Have you become content with this worldly life over the Hereafter? The enjoyment of this worldly life compared to the Hereafter is nothing","9:39":"If you do not mobilize, then He will punish you with a painful retribution, and He will replace you with another people, and you do not bother Him in the least. God is capable of all things","9:40":"If you do not help him, then God has helped him. When those who rejected expelled him, he was one of only two, and when they were in the cave, he said to his friend: \"Do not grieve, for God is with us.\" So God sent down His tranquility over him and He supported him with soldiers that you did not see, and He made the word of those who rejected be the lowest, and the word of God be the highest. God is Noble, Wise","9:41":"Mobilize in light gear or heavy gear, and strive with your money and lives in the cause of God. That is best if only you knew","9:42":"If it were a near gain, or an easy journey, they would have followed you; but the distance was too much for them. And they will swear by God: \"If we could have, we would have gone with you.\" They destroy themselves, and God knows they are liars","9:43":"God pardons you; why did you give them leave before it became clear to you who are truthful, and who are lying","9:44":"Those who believe in God and the Last Day will not ask leave. They strive with their money and their lives. And God is aware of the righteous","9:45":"Those who ask leave are the ones who do not believe in God and the Last Day, and their hearts are in doubt. In their doubts they are wavering","9:46":"And if they had wanted to go then they would have taken all precautions for it, but God disliked them coming forth, so He made them lag behind, and they were told: \"Stay with those who have stayed","9:47":"Had they gone with you they would have added nothing except disruption, and they would have hurried about seeking to cause for you an ordeal; and there are some among you who listen to them. God is aware of the wicked","9:48":"They wanted to cause an ordeal from before, and they turned matters upside down for you until the truth came and the command of God was revealed, while they hated it","9:49":"And from them are those who say: \"Grant me leave, and do not test me.\" But it is in the test that they have indeed fallen, and Hell is surrounding the rejecters","9:50":"When any good befalls you, it upsets them, and if any bad befalls you, they say: \"We have taken our precaution beforehand,\" and they turn away happy","9:51":"Say: \"Nothing will befall us except what God has decreed for us, He is our Patron.\" And in God the believers shall put their trust","9:52":"Say: \"You can only expect for us one of two good things; while we wait for you to be afflicted by God with a retribution from Him, or by our hands. So wait, we are with you waiting","9:53":"Say: \"Spend willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you. You are a wicked people","9:54":"And what prevented what they would spend from being accepted from them except that they rejected God and His messenger, and they do not attend the contact prayer except lazily, and they do not spend except unwillingly","9:55":"So do not be impressed by their wealth or children; God only wishes to punish them with it in the worldly life, and so that their souls will be taken while they are rejecters","9:56":"And they swear by God that they are with you, while they are not with you; but they are a people who are indecisive","9:57":"If they find a refuge, or cave, or any place to enter, they will run to it while they are in haste","9:58":"And from them are those who criticize you regarding the charities. If they are given from it, they are content; and if they are not given from it, they become enraged","9:59":"And if they had only been content with what God and His messenger had given them, and they had said: \"God suffices; God will give us from His bounty, and His messenger; it is towards God that we desire","9:60":"Indeed, the charities are for the poor, and the needy, and those who work to collect them, and those whose hearts have been united, and to free the slaves, and those in debt, and in the cause of God, and the wayfarer. A duty from God, and God is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:61":"And from them are those who harm the prophet, and they say: \"He only listens!\" Say: \"What he listens to is best for you. He believes in God, and he has trust for the believers, and he is a mercy to those who believe among you.\" And those who harm the messenger of God will have a painful retribution","9:62":"They swear to you by God in order to please you; while God and His messenger are more worthy to be pleased if they are believers","9:63":"Did they not know that whoever is hostile towards God and His messenger, he will have the fire of Hell, abiding therein. Such is the greatest humiliation","9:64":"The hypocrites fear that a chapter will be sent down which will expose what is in their hearts. Say: \"Mock, for God will bring out what you fear","9:65":"And if you ask them they say: \"We were only jesting and playing.\" Say: \"In God and His revelations and His messenger you were mocking","9:66":"Do not apologize, for you have rejected after your belief. If We pardon one group from you, We will punish another group. That is because they were criminals","9:67":"The hypocrite males and the hypocrite females, they are to each other. They order vice and prohibit good, and they close their hands. They forgot God, so He will forget them; indeed, the hypocrites are the wicked","9:68":"God has promised the hypocrite males and the hypocrite females and the rejecters a Fire in Hell, in it they will abide; it will be enough for them. And God has cursed them and they will have a lasting retribution","9:69":"Like those before them, they were more powerful than you, and with more wealth and children. They enjoyed their lives, and you enjoyed your lives as those before you enjoyed their lives; and you jested as they jested. They had their works crumble in this world and the next, and they were the losers","9:70":"Did the news not come to them of those before them, the people of Noah and 'Aad and Thamud. And the people of Abraham, and the dwellers of Midyan, and those overthrown. Their messengers came to them with clarity; it was not God who wronged them, but it was themselves that they wronged","9:71":"And the believing males and the believing females, they are allies to one another. They order good and prohibit vice, and they hold the contact prayer, and they contribute towards purification and they obey God and His messenger. God will have mercy on them; God is Noble, Wise","9:72":"God has promised the believing males and the believing females estates with rivers flowing beneath them, abiding therein, and pleasing homes in gardens of delight. And the acceptance from God is the most important; such is the great triumph","9:73":"O prophet, strive against the rejecters and the hypocrites and be firm against them. Their dwelling is Hell, what a miserable destiny","9:74":"They swear by God that they did not say it, while they had said the word of rejection, and they rejected after they had submitted, and they were obsessed with what they could not possess; and they could not find any fault except that God and His messenger had enriched them from His bounty. If they repent it is better for them, and if they turn away, then God will punish them severely in this world and the next. They will not have on the earth any ally or supporter","9:75":"And from them are those who pledged to God: \"If He gives us from His bounty, then we will believe and we will be among the upright","9:76":"So when He gave them from His bounty, they became stingy with it, and they turned away while they were averse","9:77":"Thus, hypocrisy follows in their hearts until the Day they meet Him; that is for breaking what they promised God, and for what they were lying","9:78":"Did they not know that God knows their secrets, and their private counsel, and that God is the Knower of all the unseen","9:79":"Those who criticize the volunteers among the believers in charities; that they only have their efforts to give; so they mock them. God mocks them, and they will have a painful retribution","9:80":"Whether you seek forgiveness for them, or do not seek forgiveness for them. If you seek forgiveness for them seventy times, God will not forgive them. That is because they have rejected God and His messenger; and God does not guide the wicked people","9:81":"Those who have remained are happy with their position of lagging behind the messenger of God, and they disliked striving with their money and lives in the cause of God; and they say: \"Do not mobilize in the heat.\" Say: \"The fire of Hell is much hotter,\" if they could only understand","9:82":"Let them laugh a little, and cry a lot, a recompense for what they have earned","9:83":"So, if God sends you back to a group of them, and they ask your permission to come with you, then say: \"You will not come with me ever; nor will you fight any enemy with me. You had accepted staying behind the first time, so stay with those who remain behind","9:84":"And do not make the contact prayer for any of them who have died, nor stand at their grave. They have rejected God and His messenger and died while they were wicked","9:85":"And do not be impressed by their wealth and their children; God only wishes to punish them with it in this world, and so their souls will be taken while they are rejecters","9:86":"And if a chapter is sent down: \"That you shall believe in God and strive with His messenger,\" those with wealth and influence ask your leave and they say: \"Let us be with those who remain behind","9:87":"They were content to stay with those who remained behind, and it was imprinted on their hearts, for they do not understand","9:88":"But the messenger and those who believe with him have strived with their money and their lives. For them will be the good things, and they are the successful ones","9:89":"God has prepared for them estates with rivers flowing beneath them, abiding therein. Such is the great gain","9:90":"And those who had an excuse from among the Nomads came so leave would be given to them, and those who denied God and His messenger simply stayed behind. Those who rejected from them will be inflicted with a painful retribution","9:91":"There is no blame to be placed upon the weak, or the sick, or those who do not find anything to spend on, if they are sincere towards God and His messenger. There is no argument against the good doers; and God is Forgiving, Merciful","9:92":"Nor upon those who came to ride out with you, while you said: \"I do not have any mounts for you;\" they turned away while their eyes were flooded with tears out of sadness, for they could not find anything to contribute","9:93":"Indeed, the argument is against those who sought your leave while they were rich. They accepted to be with those who remained behind, and God stamps their hearts, for they do not know","9:94":"They will apologize to you when you return to them, say: \"Do not apologize, we will not believe you, for God has told us of your news.\" And God will see your work, as will His messenger, then you will be returned to Knower of the unseen and the seen, He will inform you of what you did","9:95":"They will swear by God to you, when you return to them, so that you would let them be. So let them be, for they are tainted, and their destiny is Hell as a recompense for what they earned","9:96":"They swear to you so that you would accept them. Even if you accept them, God does not accept the wicked people","9:97":"The Nomads are the worst in rejection and hypocrisy, and more likely not to know the boundaries of what God has sent down upon His messenger. God is Knower, Wise","9:98":"And from the Nomads are some who look upon what they spend as a fine, and wait for misfortune upon you. They will have the misfortune of evil, and God is Hearer, Knowledgeable","9:99":"And from the Nomads are those who believe in God and the Last Day, and he looks upon what he spends to make him closer to God, and the contact prayers of the messenger. It indeed makes them closer. God will admit them in His mercy; God is Forgiving, Merciful","9:100":"And those who came early and quickly from among the emigrants and the supporters, and those who followed them in goodness; God has accepted them, and they have accepted Him; and He has prepared for them estates with rivers flowing beneath them, abiding therein eternally. Such is the great triumph","9:101":"And from among the Nomads around you are hypocrites, and from among the people of the city, they persist in hypocrisy. You do not know them, but We know them. We will punish them twice, then they will be returned to a great punishment","9:102":"And others who have acknowledged their sins, they have mixed a good work with another that was bad. Perhaps God will pardon them. God is Forgiving, Merciful","9:103":"Take from their money a charity to purify them and develop them with it, and make contact with them; for your contact is a tranquility for them; and God is Hearer, Knowledgeable","9:104":"Did they not know that it is God who accepts repentance from His servants, and He takes the charities, and that God is the Pardoner, Merciful","9:105":"And say: \"Work, and God will see your work and His messenger and the believers. And you will be sent back to Knower of the unseen and the seen, and He will inform you of what you did","9:106":"And others are made to wait for the decision of God; either He will punish them, or He will pardon them. God is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:107":"And there are those who have taken a temple to do harm and cause rejection, and to divide between the believers, and as an outpost for those who fought God and His messenger before. They will swear that they only wanted to do good, and God bears witness that they are liars","9:108":"Do not stand in it ever. A temple that is founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy that you stand in it; in it are men who love to purify themselves. And God loves the purified","9:109":"Is he who founds his building on obtaining righteousness from God and His acceptance better, or he who founds his building on the edge of a cliff which is about to crumble, so that it crumbled with him into the fires of Hell? And God does not guide the wicked people","9:110":"Their buildings that they built continue to cause doubt in their hearts, until their hearts are severed. And God is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:111":"God has purchased from the believers their very lives and their wealth, that they will have the Paradise; they fight in the cause of God so they kill and are killed; a promise that is true upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur'an. And whoever fulfills this pledge with God, then have good news of the pledge which you are concluded with. Such is the great triumph","9:112":"They are the repenters, the worshipers, the thankful, the devout, the kneeling, the prostrating, the advocates of good and the prohibiters of vice, and the caretakers of the boundaries of God; and give good news to the believers","9:113":"It is not for the prophet and those who believe that they should seek forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they are relatives, after it has been made clear to them that they are the dwellers of Hell","9:114":"And Abraham seeking forgiveness for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear that he was the enemy of God, he disowned him. Abraham was kind, compassionate","9:115":"And it is not for God to misguide a people after He guided them, until He makes clear to them what they should avoid. God is aware of all things","9:116":"To God is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, He brings life and death. You have none besides God as a supporter or victor","9:117":"God has pardoned the prophet and the emigrants and the supporters who had followed him in the darkest hour, even though the hearts of some of them nearly deviated, but then He pardoned them. He is towards them Compassionate, Merciful","9:118":"And also the three who were left behind, until the land, as vast as it is, became strained to them, and their very souls became strained, and they thought there was no shelter from God except to Him. Then He pardoned them that they may repent. God is the Redeemer, the Merciful","9:119":"O you who believe, be aware of God and be with the truthful","9:120":"It is not advisable for the dwellers of the city and those around them of the Nomads that they should lag behind after the messenger of God, nor should they yearn for themselves above him. That is because any thirst that will come to them, or fatigue, or hunger in the cause of God, or any step that they take which will annoy the rejecters, or any gain they have over any enemy; it will be recorded as a good deed for them. God does not waste the reward of the good doers","9:121":"And anything small or large they spend, or any valley they cross, it will be recorded for them. God will recompense them with the best of what they did","9:122":"And it is not advisable for the believers to mobilize in their entirety. For every battalion that marches out, let a group remain to study the system, and warn their people when they return to them, perhaps they will be aware","9:123":"O you who believe, fight those who are around you of the rejecters, and let them find strength in you; and know that God is with the righteous","9:124":"And when a chapter is sent down, some of them say: \"Who has been increased in faith by this?\" For those who believe, it has increased their faith, and they rejoice","9:125":"As for those who have a disease in their hearts, it only increased tainting to their taint, and they died as rejecters","9:126":"Do they not see they are tested every year once or twice? But then they do not repent, nor do they remember","9:127":"And when a chapter is sent down, they look at one another: \"Does anyone see you?\" Then they turn away. God turns away their hearts, for they are a people who do not understand","9:128":"A messenger has come to you from yourselves, troubled over your deviation, anxious over you, towards the believers he is compassionate, merciful","9:129":"If they turn away, then say: \"God is sufficient for me, there is no god except He, in Him I place my trust and He is the Lord of the great Throne","10:1":"ALR, these are the signs of the Book of wisdom","10:2":"Is it a surprise for the people who We inspired a man from among them: \"Warn the people and give good news to those who believe, that they will have a footing of truth with their Lord.\" The rejecters said: \"This is clearly magic","10:3":"Your Lord is God who has created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He settled upon the Throne; He manages all affairs. There is no intercessor except after His permission. Such is God your Lord, so serve Him. Would you not remember","10:4":"To Him is your return, all of you, for the promise of God is true. He initiates the creation then He returns it; to recompense with justice those who have believed and have done good works. As for those who have rejected, they will have a boiling drink, and a painful retribution for what they had rejected","10:5":"He is the One who has made the sun a radiance, and the moon a light, and He has measured its phases; that you may know the number of the years and the count. God has not created this except with the truth. He clarifies the revelations for a people who know","10:6":"In the difference between the night and the day and what God has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for a people who are aware","10:7":"As for those who do not wish to meet Us, and they are content with the worldly life, and they feel secure by it, and they are unaware of Our signs","10:8":"To these will be the destiny of the Fire for what they earned","10:9":"Those who believe and do good works, their Lord will guide them by their faith. Rivers will flow beneath them in gardens of bliss","10:10":"Their saying in it is: \"Be you glorified, our god!\" And their greeting in it is: \"Peace,\" and the end of their saying is: \"Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds","10:11":"And if God hastened for the people the evil as He hastens for them the good, then they would have been ruined. We thus leave those who do not wish to meet Us wandering in their transgression","10:12":"And when hardship touches man, he calls upon Us on his side or sitting or standing. But when We remove his hardship from him, he carries on as if he never called upon Us for a hardship which touched him! Thus it was made to appear good to the transgressors what they had done","10:13":"And We have destroyed the generations before you when they transgressed; and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs, but they would not believe. It is such that We recompense the criminal people","10:14":"Then We made you successors on the earth after them to see how you would perform","10:15":"And when Our clear revelations were recited to them, those who do not wish to meet Us said: \"Bring a Qur'an other than this, or change it!\" Say: \"It is not for me to change it of my own accord, I merely follow what is inspired to me. I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the retribution of a great Day","10:16":"Say: \"If God had willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would you have known about it. I have been residing among you for nearly a lifetime before this; do you not comprehend","10:17":"Who is more wicked than he who invents lies about God or denies His revelations? The criminals will never succeed","10:18":"And they serve besides God what does not harm them or benefit them, and they say: \"These are our intercessors with God.\" Say: \"Are you informing God of what He does not know in the heavens or the earth?\" Be He glorified and exalted above what they set up","10:19":"The people were but one nation, then they differed. And had it not been for a previous command from your Lord, the matter would have been immediately judged between them for what they differed","10:20":"And they say: \"If only a sign was sent down to him from His Lord.\" Say: \"The future is with God, so wait, and I will wait with you","10:21":"And if We let the people taste a mercy after some hardship had afflicted them, they take to scheming against Our revelations! Say: \"God is faster in scheming;\" Our messengers record what you scheme","10:22":"He is the One who carries you on land and on the sea. And when you are on the ships and We drive them with a good wind which they rejoice with, a strong gust comes to them and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think that they are finished, they implore God with loyalty and devotion to His system: \"If You save us from this, we will be of the thankful","10:23":"But when He saves them, they then traverse through the land with injustice. \"O people, what you seek out is only the luxury of this worldly life, then to Us is your return and We will inform you of all that you had done","10:24":"The example of the worldly life is like a water which has come down from the sky, so it mixed with the plants of the earth from what the people and the livestock eat. Then the earth takes its shape and becomes beautiful and its inhabitants think that they have mastered it; then Our judgment comes by night or by day, so We make it a wasteland as if it never prospered by the yesterday! It is such that We clarify the revelations for a people who think","10:25":"God calls to the abode of peace, and He guides those whom He wishes to a straight path","10:26":"For those who do good will be good and more, and their faces will not be darkened or humiliated. These are the people of the Paradise, in it they will abide","10:27":"As for those who earn evil, the recompense of evil will be evil like it, and they will be humiliated. They do not have anyone to help them from God. It is as if their faces have been covered by a piece of darkness from the night. These are the people of the Fire, in it they will abide","10:28":"And on the Day We gather them all, then We will say to those who were polytheists: \"Stop where you are, you and your partners,\" then We will separate between them, and their partners will say: \"It was not us that you served","10:29":"God is enough as a witness between us and you, that we were unaware of you serving us","10:30":"It is then that every soul will know what it has done, and they will be returned to God their true patron, and they have been abandoned by that which they had invented","10:31":"Say: \"Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth? Who possesses the hearing and the eyesight? And who brings the living out from the dead and brings the dead out from the living? And who manages all affairs?\" They will say: \"God.\" Say: \"Will you not be righteous","10:32":"Such is God, your true Lord. So what is after the truth except straying! Why then do you turn away","10:33":"It was thus that the command of your Lord came against those who were wicked, for they did not believe","10:34":"Say: \"Are there any from those whom you have set up as partners who can initiate the creation and then return it?\" Say: \"God initiates the creation and then returns it.\" How are you deluded","10:35":"Say: \"Are there any of those whom you set up as partners who can guide to the truth?\" Say: \"God guides to the truth. Is He who guides to the truth more worthy of being followed, or he who does not guide except after he is guided? What is wrong with you, how do you judge","10:36":"Most of them only follow conjecture. While conjecture does not avail against the truth in anything. God is aware of what they do","10:37":"This Qur'an could not have been produced without God; it is to authenticate what is between his hands, and to give details of the Book in which there is no doubt, from the Lord of the worlds","10:38":"Or do they say: \"He has invented it!\" Say: \"Then bring a chapter like it, and call on whom you can besides God if you are truthful","10:39":"No, they have lied about that which they had no knowledge, nor has its explanation come to them. It is also how those before them denied, so see how was the retribution of the wicked","10:40":"And there are some of them who believe in it, and some of them do not believe in it. Your Lord is better aware of the transgressors","10:41":"And if they deny you, then say: \"I have my deeds, and you have your deeds. You are innocent from what I do, and I am innocent from what you do","10:42":"And there are some of them who listen to you; but can you make the deaf hear, if they do not comprehend","10:43":"And there are some of them who look at you; but can you guide the blind, if they do not see","10:44":"God does not wrong the people in the least, but it is the people who wrong themselves","10:45":"And the Day He gathers them, it will be as if they had stayed but an hour of a day. They will get to know one another. Losers will be those who have denied meeting God, and they have not been guided","10:46":"And if We show you some of what We promise them, or We terminate your life, to Us is their return. Then God is a witness over what they do","10:47":"And for every nation is a messenger; so when their messenger comes, the matter is decreed between them with justice, and they are not wronged","10:48":"And they say: \"When is this promise if you are truthful","10:49":"Say: \"I do not possess for myself any harm or benefit except what God wills. For every nation is a time. When their time comes, they cannot delay it one hour nor advance it","10:50":"Say: \"Do you see if His retribution will come to you by night or by day, then which portion would the criminals hasten in","10:51":"Will you then, when it occurs, believe in it? While now you are hastening it on","10:52":"Then it will be said to those who were wicked: \"Taste the everlasting retribution. You are only recompensed for what you have earned","10:53":"And they seek news from you: \"Is it true?\" Say: \"Yes, by my Lord it is true, and you cannot escape from it","10:54":"And if every soul who wronged had possessed all that is on the earth, it would have attempted to ransom it. And they declared their regret when they saw the retribution, and it was judged between them with fairness. They were not wronged","10:55":"To God is what is in the heavens and the earth. The promise of God is true, but most of them do not know","10:56":"He gives life, and He brings death, and to Him you will return","10:57":"O people, advice has come to you from your Lord and a healing for what is in the chests, and a guidance and a mercy for the believers","10:58":"Say: \"By the grace of God and His mercy.\" For that let them rejoice, that is better than all that they gather","10:59":"Say: \"Have you seen what God has sent down to you from provisions, then you have made some of it forbidden and some lawful?\" Say: \"Did God authorize you, or do you invent lies about God","10:60":"And what will those who invent lies about God think on the Day of Resurrection? God is with great bounty to the people, but most of them are not thankful","10:61":"And any matter you are in, or any reciting you do of the Qur'an, or any work you do; We are witnesses over you when you undertake it. Nothing is hidden from your Lord, not even the weight of an atom on the earth or in the heavens, nor smaller than that nor larger, except it is in a clear record","10:62":"For the allies of God, there is no fear over them nor will they grieve","10:63":"Those who have believed and are aware","10:64":"For them are glad tidings in the worldly life and in the Hereafter. There is no changing the words of God. Such is the great triumph","10:65":"And do not be saddened by their speech, for all glory is to God. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable","10:66":"Certainly, to God belong all who are in the heavens and those who are on the earth. As for those who call on partners besides God, they only follow conjecture, and they only guess","10:67":"He is the One who made the night for you to reside in, and the day to see. In that are signs for a people who listen","10:68":"They said: \"God has taken a son.\" Glory be to Him! He is the Rich. To Him is what is in the heavens and the earth. Do you have proof for this? Or do you say about God what you do not know","10:69":"Say: \"Those who invent lies about God, they will not be successful","10:70":"A short pleasure in this world, then to Us is their return and We will make them taste the severe retribution for what they were rejecting","10:71":"And recite to them the news of Noah, as he said to his people: \"My people, if my station has become too troublesome for you, and my reminding you of the signs of God, then in God I place my trust. So gather your evidence and your partners, then make certain your evidence does not become against you, then come to judge me, and do not hold back","10:72":"But if you turn away, then I have not asked you for any wage, for my wage is with God. And I have been commanded to be of those who have submitted","10:73":"They denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship, and We made them successors, and We drowned those who denied Our revelations. So see how was the punishment of those who were warned","10:74":"Then, after him, We sent messengers to their own people, so they came to them with proofs. But they did not want to believe in what they had already denied beforehand. Thus it is We stamp upon the hearts of the transgressors","10:75":"Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aaron with Our signs to Pharaoh and his leaders, but they turned arrogant, they were a criminal people","10:76":"So when the truth came to them from Us, they said: \"This is clearly magic","10:77":"Moses said: \"Would you say this about the truth when it came to you? Is this magic? The magicians will not be successful","10:78":"They said: \"Have you come to us to turn us away from that which we found our fathers upon, and so that you two would have greatness in the land? We will not believe in you","10:79":"And Pharaoh said: \"Bring me every knowledgeable magician","10:80":"So, when the magicians came, Moses said to them: \"Cast what you will cast","10:81":"So when they cast, Moses said: \"What you have brought is magic, God will disable it. God does not set right the works of the corrupters","10:82":"And so that God will set the truth with His words, even if the criminals hate it","10:83":"But none believed in Moses from his people except some from their descendants, because of their fear from Pharaoh and his commanders that he would persecute them. Pharaoh was high in the land, and he was of the tyrants","10:84":"And Moses said: \"O my people, if you believe in God, then put your trust in Him if you have submitted","10:85":"They said: \"In God we put our trust. Our Lord, do not make us a test for the wicked people","10:86":"And save us by Your mercy from the rejecting people","10:87":"And We inspired to Moses and his brother: \"You shall seek out homes for your people in Egypt; and leave your homes to be a focal point, and hold the contact prayer. And give good news to the believers","10:88":"And Moses said: \"Our Lord, you have given Pharaoh and his commanders adornments and wealth in this worldly life so that they will misguide from Your path. Our Lord, wipe out their wealth and bring grief to their hearts; for they will not believe until they see the painful retribution","10:89":"He said: \"Your call has been responded to, so keep straight and do not follow the path of those who do not know","10:90":"And We helped the Children of Israel cross the sea, and Pharaoh and his soldiers followed them out of hatred and animosity. But when he was certain to drown, he said: \"I believe that there is no god except the One in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of those who have submitted","10:91":"Now you say this? While before you disobeyed and were of the corrupters","10:92":"This day, We will preserve your body, so that you become a sign for those after you.\" But most of the people are unaware of Our signs","10:93":"And We helped the Children of Israel reach a place of sanctity, and We provided them from the good things, and they did not differ until the knowledge came to them. Your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection for what they differed in","10:94":"If you are in doubt regarding what We have sent down to you, then ask those who have been reading the Book from before you. The truth has come to you from your Lord, so do not be of those who doubt","10:95":"And do not be of those who have denied the revelations of God, for you will be of the losers","10:96":"Those who have deserved the retribution of your Lord do not believe","10:97":"Even if every sign were to come to them; until they see the painful retribution","10:98":"If there was any town that benefited from its belief, then that was the people of Jonah. When they believed, We removed from them the retribution of disgrace in this worldly life, and We let them enjoy until a time","10:99":"And had your Lord willed, all the people on the earth in their entirety would have believed. Would you force the people to make them believe","10:100":"And it is not for a soul to believe except with the permission of God. And He lets taint those who do not comprehend","10:101":"Say: \"Look at all that is in the heavens and the earth.\" But what good are the signs and warnings to a people who do not believe","10:102":"Are they waiting for the days like those who have passed away before them? Say: \"Wait, for I am with you waiting","10:103":"Then We will save Our messengers and those who believe. It is thus binding upon Us that We save the believers","10:104":"Say: \"O people, if you are in doubt of my system, then I do not serve those whom you serve besides God. But I serve God; the One who will terminate your lives; and I have been commanded to be of the believers","10:105":"And set your face to the system of monotheism, and do not be of the polytheists","10:106":"And do not call upon other than God what does not benefit you or harm you; if you do, then you are of the wicked","10:107":"And if God afflicts you with any harm, then none can remove it except He; and if He wanted good for you, then none can turn away His grace, He brings it to whom He wishes of His servants. And He is the Forgiver, the Merciful","10:108":"Say: \"O people, the truth has come to you from your Lord, so whoever is guided is being guided for himself, and whoever is misguided will remain so, and I am not a caretaker over you","10:109":"And follow what is being inspired to you and be patient until God judges. And He is the best of judges","11:1":"ALR, a Book in which its revelations have been made lawgiving, then detailed, from One who is Wise, Expert","11:2":"That you shall serve none other than God. I am to you from Him a warner and a bearer of good news","11:3":"And seek forgiveness from your Lord, then repent to Him; He will provide you with good provisions to an appointed term. And He bestows His grace upon those who are of grace.\" And if they turn away: \"Indeed, I fear for you the retribution of a great day","11:4":"To God is your return, and He is capable of all things","11:5":"Alas, they have folded their chests to hide from it. Even when they cover themselves under their garments, He knows what they keep secret and what they declare. He is Knower of all that is in the chests","11:6":"And there is not a creature on the earth but on God is its provision. And He knows where it dwells and where it hides. All is in a clear record","11:7":"He is the One who has created the heavens and the earth in six days, and His Throne was upon the water; so as to test who from among you works the best. And when you say: \"You will be resurrected after the death,\" those who have rejected say: \"This is but clear magic","11:8":"And if We delay for them the retribution to a near period, they will say: \"What has kept it?\" Alas, on the day it comes to them, nothing will turn it away from them, and they will be surrounded by that which they used to mock","11:9":"And if We give man a taste of a mercy from Us, then We withdraw it from him; he becomes despairing, rejecting","11:10":"And if We give him the taste of a blessing after hardship has afflicted him, he says: \"Evil has gone from me!\" He becomes happy, boastful","11:11":"Except for those who are patient and do good works; these will have a pardon, and a great reward","11:12":"So perhaps you wish to ignore some of what has been inspired to you, and you are depressed by it, because they say: \"If only a treasure was sent down with him, or an angel had come with him!\" You are but a warner, and God is Caretaker over all things","11:13":"Or do they say: \"He has invented it!\" Say: \"Then bring ten invented chapters like it, and call on whom you can besides God if you are truthful","11:14":"So, if they do not respond to you, then know that it has been sent down with the knowledge of God, and that there is no god except He. Will you then submit","11:15":"Whoever wants the worldly life and its adornments, then We will grant them their works in it, and they will not be short changed in it","11:16":"These will have nothing but fire in the Hereafter, and what they have done will be in vain, and evil is what they have worked","11:17":"For those who are on a clarity from their Lord, and are followed by a testimony from Him; and before it was the Book of Moses, a beacon and a mercy; they will believe in it. And whoever rejects it from among the Confederates, then the Fire is his meeting place. So do not be in any doubt about it. It is the truth from your Lord, but most of the people do not believe","11:18":"And who is more wicked than he who invents lies about God? They will be displayed before their Lord, and the witnesses will say: \"These are the ones who have lied about their Lord.\" Alas, the curse of God will be upon the wicked","11:19":"Those who repel others from the path of God and they seek to twist it; and regarding the Hereafter they are in denial","11:20":"These are the ones who will not escape on the earth, nor do they have besides God any allies. The retribution will be doubled for them. They were not able to hear, nor could they see","11:21":"They are the ones who have lost their souls, and what they had invented has abandoned them","11:22":"There is no doubt, that in the Hereafter they are the greatest losers","11:23":"Those who believe and do good works, and are humble towards their Lord; they are the dwellers of the Paradise, in it they will remain","11:24":"The example of the two groups is like the blind and deaf, and the seer and hearer. Are they the same when compared? Do you not take heed","11:25":"And We had sent Noah to his people: \"I am to you a clear warner","11:26":"That you serve none except God. I fear for you the retribution of a painful day","11:27":"The leaders who rejected from among his people said: \"We do not see you except as a human being like us, and we see that only the lowest among our people who have no opinion have followed you. And we do not see a thing that makes you better than us; in fact, we think you are liars","11:28":"He said: \"O my people, do you see that should I be upon a clarity from my Lord, and He has given me a mercy from Himself, that you may be blinded to it? Shall we compel you to it while in-fact you hate it","11:29":"And my people, I do not ask you for money, my wage is from God. Nor will I turn away those who believe, for they will meet their Lord. But I see that you are a people who are ignorant","11:30":"And my people, who will give me victory against God if I turn them away? Will you not remember","11:31":"Nor do I say to you that I have the treasures of God, nor do I know the future, nor do I say that I am an angel, nor do I say to those whom your eyes look down upon that God will not grant them any good. God is more aware of what is in their souls; in such case I would be among the wicked","11:32":"They said: \"O Noah, you have argued with us, and continued arguing with us, so bring us what you promise us if you are of the truthful ones","11:33":"He said: \"It is God who will bring it to you if He wishes; you will not have any escape","11:34":"And my advice will not benefit you if I wanted to advise you and God wanted that you should go astray. He is your Lord, and to Him you will return","11:35":"Or do they say: \"He has invented it?\" Say: \"If I have invented it, then I am responsible for my crime, and I am innocent from your crimes","11:36":"And it was inspired to Noah: \"No more of your people will believe except those who have already believed. So do not be saddened by what they have done","11:37":"And construct the ship under Our eyes and Our inspiration, and do not speak to Me regarding those who are wicked. They will be drowned","11:38":"And as he was constructing the ship, every time any cluster from his people passed by, they mocked him. He said: \"If you mock us, then we also mock you as you mock","11:39":"You will know to whom the retribution will come to disgrace him, and upon him will be a lasting punishment","11:40":"So, when Our command came and the chamber erupted. We said: \"Carry in it a pair from each kind, and your family; except those against whom the word has been issued; and whoever has believed.\" But those who believed with him were few","11:41":"And he said: \"Ride in it, in the name of God shall be its running and its anchorage. My Lord is Forgiving, Merciful","11:42":"And while it was running with them in waves like mountains, Noah called to his son, who was in an isolated place: \"My son, ride with us, and do not be with the rejecters","11:43":"He said: \"I will take refuge to the mountain which will protect me from the water.\" He said: \"There is no protection from the decree of God except for those He has granted mercy.\" And the wave came between them, so he was one of those who drowned","11:44":"And it was said: \"O land, swallow your water, and O sky, cease.\" And the water was diminished, and the matter concluded. And it came to rest on the Judi, and it was said: \"Away with the wicked people","11:45":"And Noah called on his Lord, and he said: \"My Lord, my son is from my family, and your promise is the truth, and you are the Wisest of all Judges","11:46":"He said: \"O Noah, he is not from your family, he was of an unrighteous deed, so do not ask what you have no knowledge of. I advise you not to be of the ignorant","11:47":"He said: \"My Lord, I seek refuge with You from asking You what I do not have knowledge of. And if You do not forgive me and have mercy on me, I will be of the losers","11:48":"It was said: \"O Noah, descend in peace from Us and blessings upon you and upon nations to come from those with you. And nations whom We will give enjoyment, then a painful retribution will reach them from Us","11:49":"This is from the news of the unseen that We inspire to you. Neither did you nor your people know this, so be patient; the ending will be for the righteous","11:50":"And to 'Aad was sent their brother Hud. He said: \"My people, serve God, you have no god besides Him; you are simply conjecturing","11:51":"My people, I do not ask you for any wage, my wage is from the One who has initiated me. Will you not comprehend","11:52":"And my people, seek forgiveness from your Lord, then repent to Him; He will send the sky to you abundantly, and He will add might to your might. So do not turn away as criminals","11:53":"They said: \"O Hud, you have not come to us with any proof, nor will we leave our gods based on what you say. We will not believe in you","11:54":"All we can say is that perhaps some of our gods have seized you with evil.\" He said: \"I make God my witness, and all of you witness, that I am innocent of what you have set up","11:55":"Besides Him, so plan against me all of you, then do not give me respite","11:56":"I have placed my trust in God, my Lord and your Lord. There is not a creature except He will seize it by its forelock. My Lord is on a straight path","11:57":"So, if you turn away, then I have delivered what I have been sent to you with, and my Lord will bring after you a people who are not like you; and you cannot harm Him the least. My Lord is Guardian over all things","11:58":"And when Our command came, We saved Hud and those who had believed with him by a mercy from Us, and We saved them from a mighty retribution","11:59":"Such was the case of 'Aad. They disregarded the revelations of their Lord, and they disobeyed His messengers, and they followed the command of every stubborn tyrant","11:60":"And they were followed by a curse in this world and on the Day of Resurrection, for 'Aad rejected their Lord. So away with 'Aad, the people of Hud","11:61":"And to Thamud was their brother Saleh. He said: \"O my people, serve God, you have no god besides Him. He has established you from the earth, and has made you settle in it; so seek His forgiveness, then repent to Him. My Lord is Near, Responsive","11:62":"They said: \"O Saleh, you were well liked among us before this. Do you prohibit us from serving what our fathers served? We are in serious doubt as to what you are inviting us","11:63":"He said: \"O my people, do you see that should I be upon a clarity from my Lord, and He has given me a mercy from Himself. Who would then support me against God if I disobey Him? You would only increase me in loss","11:64":"And O my people, this is the camel of God, in her you have a sign. So leave her to eat from God's earth freely, and do not harm her, or else a close retribution will take you","11:65":"But they slaughtered her. So he said: \"Take enjoyment in your dwellings for three days. This is a promise not to be denied","11:66":"So, when Our command came, We saved Saleh and those who had believed with him by a mercy from Us and against the disgrace of that day. Your Lord is the Powerful, the Noble","11:67":"And those who had wronged were taken by the scream, thus they became lifeless in their homes","11:68":"It is as if they had never lived there. For Thamud rejected their Lord. So away with Thamud","11:69":"And Our messengers came to Abraham with good news, they said: \"Peace\" He said: \"Peace,\" and he made no delay in bringing a roasted calf","11:70":"But when he saw that their hands did not go towards it, he mistrusted them, and he began to have fear of them. They said: \"Have no fear, we have been sent to the people of Lot","11:71":"And his wife was standing, so she laughed when We gave her the good news of Isaac, and after Isaac, Jacob","11:72":"She said: \"O my! Shall I give birth when I am an old woman, and here is my husband an old man? This is indeed a strange thing","11:73":"They said: \"Do you wonder at the decree of God? The mercy of God and blessings are upon you O people of the Sanctuary. He is Praiseworthy, Glorious","11:74":"So when the shock left Abraham, and the good news was delivered to him, he began to argue with Us for the people of Lot","11:75":"Abraham was compassionate, kind, obedient","11:76":"O Abraham, turn away from this. The command of your Lord has been passed, and a retribution that will not be turned back is coming for them","11:77":"And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was grieved by them and he felt discomfort for them and he said: \"This is a distressful day","11:78":"And his people came rushing towards him, and before it they were committing sin, he said: \"My people, these are my daughters, they are purer for you, so be aware of God and do not disgrace me regarding my guests. Is there no wise man among you","11:79":"They said: \"You know we have no interest in your daughters, and you are aware of what we want","11:80":"He said: \"If only I had strength against you, or I could find for myself some powerful support","11:81":"They said: \"O Lot, we are messengers of your Lord; they will not be able to harm you, so travel with your family during the cover of the night and let not any of you look back except for your wife, she will be afflicted with what they will be afflicted. Their scheduled time will be the morning. Is the morning not near","11:82":"So when Our command came, We made its highest part become its lowest, and We rained on it with hardened fiery projectiles","11:83":"Marked from your Lord, and they are never far from the wicked","11:84":"And to Midyan was their brother Shu'ayb, he said: \"My people, serve God, you have no god besides Him, and do not give short in the measure and the weight. I see you in prosperity, and I fear for you the retribution of a day that is surrounding","11:85":"And my people, give full in the measure and the weight equitably, and do not hold back from the people what is theirs, and do not roam the land corrupting","11:86":"What will remain for you with God is far better if you are believers. And I am not a guardian over you","11:87":"They said: \"O Shu'ayb, does your contact prayer order you that we leave what our fathers served, or that we do not do with our money as we please? It seems only you are the compassionate, the wise","11:88":"He said: \"O my people, do you see that if I am on clear evidence from my Lord, and He has provided me with good provision from Him, then I would not want to contradict by doing what I am prohibiting you from. I only want to make right what I can, and my guidance is only with God. To Him I place my trust, and to Him I repent","11:89":"And my people, let not your hatred towards me incriminate you that you suffer the fate of what afflicted the people of Noah, or the people of Hud, or the people of Saleh; and the people of Lot were not far off from you","11:90":"And seek forgiveness from your Lord then repent to Him. My Lord is Merciful, Loving","11:91":"They said: \"O Shu'ayb, we do not understand most of what you say, and we see you as weak among us; and if it were not for who your family is, we would have stoned you, and you would not be proud against us","11:92":"He said: \"My people, is who my family is more important to you than God, while you have cast Him away behind your backs? My Lord is encompassing what you do","11:93":"And my people, continue to act as you do, and I will act. You will then come to know to whom the retribution will come to humiliate him and who is the liar. Watch then, and I will watch with you","11:94":"And when Our command came, We saved Shu'ayb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us; and the scream took those who had wronged, thus they became lifeless in their homes","11:95":"It is as if they had never lived there. Away with Midyan as it was away with Thamud","11:96":"And We sent Moses with Our signs and a clear authority","11:97":"To Pharaoh and his commanders; but they followed the order of Pharaoh; and the order of Pharaoh was not wise","11:98":"He will be at the head of his people on the Day of Resurrection, and he will lead them to the Fire. What a miserable place they will be brought in","11:99":"And they were followed by a curse in this one, and on the Day of Resurrection. What a miserable path to follow","11:100":"That is from the news of the towns which We tell to you; some are still standing and some have been wiped out","11:101":"And We had not wronged them, but they had wronged themselves; their gods that they called on besides God did not rescue them at all when the command of your Lord came, and they only added to their destruction","11:102":"And such is the seizing of your Lord when He seizes the towns while they are wicked. His taking is painful, severe","11:103":"In this is a sign for he who fears the retribution of the Hereafter. That is a Day towards which all the people will be gathered, and that is a Day which will be witnessed","11:104":"And We do not delay it except to a term already prepared for","11:105":"On the Day it comes, no person will speak except with His permission. Some of them will be distraught, some will be happy","11:106":"As for those who are distraught, they will be in the Fire; in it for them is a sighing and a wailing","11:107":"Abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth exist, except for what your Lord wishes. Your Lord does as He pleases","11:108":"As for those who are happy, they will be in the Paradise; abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth exist, except for what your Lord wishes, a giving without end","11:109":"So do not be in doubt as to what these people serve. They serve nothing except what their fathers before them served. We will give them their recompense in full","11:110":"And We gave Moses the Book, yet they disputed in it; and had it not been for a word which was already given by your Lord, their case would have been judged immediately. They are in grave doubt concerning it","11:111":"And to each your Lord will recompense their works. He is expert in what they do","11:112":"So stand straight as you were commanded, and those who have repented with you, and do not transgress. He is Seer over what you do","11:113":"And do not lean towards those who have wronged else you will incur the Fire; and you will not have besides God any allies, and you will not be victorious","11:114":"And hold the contact prayer at two parts of the day, and the near part of the night. The good deeds take away the bad. This is a reminder to those who remember","11:115":"And be patient, for God does not waste the reward of the good doers","11:116":"If only there was from the previous generations a people with wisdom who prohibited corruption on the earth, except the few that We saved of them. And those who were wicked followed the enjoyment they were in, and they were criminal","11:117":"And your Lord will not destroy the towns unjustly, while its people are good doers","11:118":"And if your Lord had wished, He could have made all the people one nation, but they still would have continued to disagree","11:119":"Except whom your Lord has mercy upon; and for that He has created them. And the word of your Lord came true: \"I will fill Hell with the Jinn and the people together","11:120":"And We tell to you from the news of the messengers with which We strengthen your heart. In this has come to you the truth and a lesson and a reminder for the believers","11:121":"And say to those who do not believe: \"Continue to do what you will, we will also do","11:122":"And wait, for we are also waiting","11:123":"And to God is the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and to Him all matters return. So serve Him and put your trust in Him. Your Lord is not unaware of what you all do","12:1":"ALR, these are the signs of the clarifying Book","12:2":"We have sent it down an Arabic revelation, perhaps you will comprehend","12:3":"We tell to you the best stories through what We have inspired to you in this Qur'an; and before it you were of those who were unaware","12:4":"When Joseph said to his father: \"My father, I have seen eleven planets and the sun and the moon, I saw them prostrating to me","12:5":"He said: \"O my son, do not tell your vision to your brothers, or they will plan against you. The devil is to man a clear enemy","12:6":"And as such, your Lord has chosen you, and He teaches you the interpretation of the narrations, and He completes His blessings upon you and upon the descendants of Jacob, as He completed it for your fathers before that, Abraham and Isaac. Your Lord is Knowledgeable, Wise","12:7":"In Joseph and his brothers are signs for those who seek","12:8":"For they said: \"Joseph and his brother are more loved by our father than us, while we are a numerous group. Our father is clearly misguided","12:9":"Kill Joseph or cast him in the land, so that the face of your father will be only for you, and after that you can be an upright people","12:10":"One among them said: \"Do not kill Joseph, but if you are going to do a thing, then cast him into the bottom of the well, so that anyone traveling by will pick him up","12:11":"They said: \"Our father, why do you not trust us with Joseph? And we will be giving him advice","12:12":"Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and we will take care of him","12:13":"He said: \"It saddens me that you should take him, and I fear that the wolf will eat him if you will be absent of him","12:14":"They said: \"If the wolf eats him, while we are a numerous group, then we are the losers","12:15":"So,when they went with him they had agreed to place him into the bottom of the well. And We inspired to him: \"You will inform them of this act of theirs while they will not expect it","12:16":"Andthey came to their father in the evening, crying","12:17":"They said: \"Our father, we went to race and left Joseph by our things, and the wolf ate him! But you would not believe us even if we were truthful","12:18":"Andthey came with his shirt stained in false blood. He said: \"You have invented this tale yourselves. So sweet patience, and God is sought for help against what you describe","12:19":"Anda traveling caravan came and they sent their man to draw water, but when he drew he said: \"Good news, there is a boy!\" So they hid him as merchandise. And God is aware of what they did","12:20":"Andthey sold him for a low price, a few coins of silver, and they regarded him as insignificant","12:21":"Andhe from Egypt who had bought him said to his wife: \"Make his stay generous, perhaps he will benefit us or we may take him as a son.\" And it was thus that We established Joseph in the land and to teach him the interpretation of the narrations. And God has full control over his situation, but most of the people do not know","12:22":"Andwhen he reached his independence, We gave him judgement and knowledge. It is thus that We reward the good doers","12:23":"Andthe woman, in whose house he was staying, attempted to seduce him away from himself. And she closed the doors and said: \"I have prepared myself for you.\" He said: \"I seek refuge with God, He is my Lord, He has made good my stay; the wicked do not succeed","12:24":"Andshe was obsessed with him, and he did obsess with her - had it not been that he saw the proof of his Lord - it was thus that We turned evil and immorality away from him; he is of Our loyal servants","12:25":"Andas they rushed towards the door, she tore his shirt from behind; and they found her master at the door. She said: \"What is the punishment for he who wanted evil for your family? Is it not that he be imprisoned or punished painfully","12:26":"He said: \"She is the one who seduced me from myself,\" and a witness from her family gave testimony: \"If his shirt was torn from the front, then she is truthful, and he is the liar","12:27":"And if his shirt is torn from behind, then she is lying, and he is truthful","12:28":"So when he saw that his shirt was torn from behind, he said: \"This is from your female planning, your female planning is indeed great","12:29":"Joseph, turn away from this. And you woman, seek forgiveness for your sin; you were of the wrongdoers","12:30":"Andsome women in the city said: \"The wife of the governor is trying to seduce her young man from himself; she is taken by love. We see her clearly misguided","12:31":"So when she heard of their scheming, she sent for them and prepared a banquet for them, and she gave each one of them a knife. And she said: \"Come out to them,\" so when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands, and they said: \"Praise be to God, this is not a human being, but a blessed angel","12:32":"Shesaid: \"This is the one whom you blamed me for, and I have seduced him from himself but he refused. And if he does not do as I command him, he will be imprisoned, and he will be one of those disgraced","12:33":"He said: \"My Lord, prison is better to me than what they are inviting me to do. And if You do not turn their plans away from me, I will fall for them and be of the ignorant","12:34":"So his Lord responded to him, and He turned away their plans from him. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable","12:35":"But it appealed to them, even after they had seen the signs, to imprison him for a time","12:36":"Andwith him in the prison entered two young men. One of them said: \"I dreamt that I was pressing alcohol,\" and the other said: \"I dreamt that I was carrying bread on top of my head, and that the birds were eating from it.\" \"Tell us its interpretation, for we see that you are of the good doers","12:37":"He said: \"No provision of food will come to you, except that I would have informed you both about its interpretation before it comes to you. That is from what my Lord has taught me. I have just left the creed of a people who do not believe in God, and they are rejecting the Hereafter","12:38":"And I have followed the creed of my fathers Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. It was not for us to set up partners with God at all. That is the blessings of God over us and over the people, but most of the people are not thankful","12:39":"Omy fellow inmates, are various lords better, or God, the One, the Supreme","12:40":"What you serve besides Him are nothing except names which you have created, both you and your fathers, God has not sent down any authority for such. The judgment is for none except God. He has ordered that none be served except He. That is the true system, but most of the people do not know","12:41":"Myfellow inmates, one of you will be serving alcohol for his lord, while the other will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head. The matter which you have sought is now concluded","12:42":"Andhe said to the one of them whom he thought would be saved: \"Mention me to your lord.\" But the devil made him forget to mention to his lord, so he remained in prison for a few years","12:43":"Andthe king said: \"I continue to dream of seven fat cows being eaten by seven thin ones, and seven green pods and others which are dry. O you commanders, tell me what my vision means if you are able to interpret the visions","12:44":"They said: \"It is nothing except bad dreams; and we are not knowledgeable in the interpretation of dreams","12:45":"Andthe one of them who had been saved and remembered after all this time said: \"I will tell you of its interpretation, so let me be sent","12:46":"Joseph, O man of truth, explain to us the matter regarding seven fat cows being eaten by seven thin ones, and seven green pods and others which are dry? Then perhaps I may go back to the people so they will know","12:47":"He said: \"You will plant regularly for seven years, and whatever you harvest you must leave it in its pods, except for the little that you will eat","12:48":"Then there will come seven after that which are severe and which will consume all that you plant except for what you have stored","12:49":"Then after that will come a year in which the people will have abundant rain and which they will be able to produce once again","12:50":"Andthe king said: \"Bring him to me.\" So when the messenger came to him, he said: \"Go back to your lord and ask him what was the matter regarding the women who cut their hands? Indeed, my Lord is aware of their plans","12:51":"He said: \"What is your plea that you tried to seduce Joseph from himself?\" They said: \"God be sought! We know of no evil on his part.\" The wife of the governor said: \"Now the truth must be known, I did seek to seduce Joseph from himself and he is of the truthful ones","12:52":"That is so he knows that I will not betray him while he is not present and that God does not guide the planning of the betrayers","12:53":"And I do not make myself free of blame, for the soul is inclined to sin, except that which my Lord has mercy upon. My Lord is Forgiving, Merciful","12:54":"Andthe king said: \"Bring him to me so that I may employ him to my person.\" So when he spoke to him, he said: \"Today you are with us in a high standing and trusted","12:55":"He said: \"Appoint me over the granaries of the land, for I know how to keep records and I am knowledgeable","12:56":"Andit was such that We gave Joseph authority in the land, to travel in it as he pleases. We bestow Our mercy upon whom We please, and We do not waste the reward of the good doers","12:57":"Andthe reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and are aware","12:58":"Andthe brothers of Joseph came and entered upon him, and he recognized them, but they did not recognize him","12:59":"So,when he furnished them with their provisions, he said: \"Bring me a brother of yours who is from your father. Do you not see that I give full measure of grain and that I am the best of hosts","12:60":"But if you do not bring him to me, then there shall be no measure of grain for you with me, and do not come near me","12:61":"They said: \"We will try to get him away from his father, and we shall be successful","12:62":"Andhe said to his servants: \"Return their goods into their saddlebags, so that they may recognize it when they return to their family so that they may come back","12:63":"So when they returned to their father, they said: \"Our father, we have been banned from getting anymore measure of grain, so send our brother with us so we may be given a measure of grain, and we will be his guardians","12:64":"He said: \"Shall I trust him with you as I trusted you with Joseph before that? God is the best guardian, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy","12:65":"So when they opened their baggage, they found their goods had been returned to them, and they said: \"Our father, what more can we desire, these are our goods returned to us, so we can get more for our family, and be guardians over our brother, and increase a measure of grain to load a camel. That is truly an easy measure","12:66":"He said: \"I will not send him with you until you come to me with a covenant to God that you will bring him back unless you are completely overtaken.\" So when they brought him their covenant, he said: \"God is placed in trust over what we say","12:67":"Andhe said: \"My sons, do not enter from one gate, but enter from separate gates; and I cannot avail you anything against God, for the judgment is to God. In Him I place my trust, and in Him those who place their trust should trust","12:68":"Andwhen they entered from where their father had commanded them, it would not have availed them in the least against God, but it was out of a concern in the soul of Jacob that he brought out. And he is with knowledge for what We taught him, but most of the people do not know","12:69":"Andwhen they entered upon Joseph, he called his brother to himself and said: \"I am your brother, so do not be saddened by what they have done","12:70":"So when he furnished them with their provisions, he placed the measuring bowl in the saddlebag of his brother, then a caller cried out: \"O you in the caravan, you are thieves","12:71":"They said, while coming towards them: \"What is it you are missing","12:72":"They said: \"We are missing the measuring bowl of the king, and whoever can produce it, will be given the load of a camel; and I will be bound by this","12:73":"They said: \"By God, you know we have not come to cause corruption in the land, and we are not thieves","12:74":"They said: \"What shall be the punishment, if you are not truthful","12:75":"They said: \"The punishment is that he in whose saddlebag it is found will himself serve as the punishment. It is so that we punish the wicked","12:76":"So he began with their bags before the bag of his brother. Then he brought it out of the bag of his brother. It was such that We planned for Joseph, for he would not have been able to take his brother under the system of the king, except that God wished it so. We raise the degrees of whom We please, and over every one of knowledge is the All Knowledgeable","12:77":"They said: \"If he has stolen, there was a brother of his before who also had stolen.\" Joseph kept this all inside himself, and did not reveal anything to them. He said: \"You are in an awkward position, and God best knows what you describe","12:78":"They said: \"O governor, he has an elderly father, so take one of us in his place. Indeed we see you as one of the good doers","12:79":"He said: \"Refuge is sought with God that we would take anyone except he whom we found our belongings with. Indeed, we would then be wrong doers","12:80":"So when they gave-up from him, they held a conference in private. The eldest of them said: \"Did you not know that your father has taken a covenant over you with God, and before this you also failed in your duty with Joseph? I will not leave this land until my father permits me to do so or that God will judge for me. He is the best of judges","12:81":"Return to your father, and tell him: \"Our father, your son has stolen, and we did not witness except what we learned, and we could not know the unseen","12:82":"And ask the people of the town which we were in, and the caravan which we have returned with. We are being truthful","12:83":"He said: \"No, for it is your own souls that have conspired you to this. So patience is most fitting, perhaps God will bring them all to me. He is the Knowledgeable, the Wise","12:84":"Andhe turned away from them and said: \"Oh, my sorrow over Joseph.\" And his eyes turned white from sadness, and he became blind","12:85":"They said: \"By God, you will never cease to remember Joseph until you become senile or become dead","12:86":"He said: \"I merely complain my grief and sorrow to God, and I know from God what you do not know","12:87":"Mysons, go and inquire about Joseph and his brother, and do not despair from the spirit of God. The only ones who would despair from the spirit of God are the people who are rejecters","12:88":"So when they entered upon him, they said: \"O governor, we have been afflicted with harm, us and our family, and we have come with poor goods to trade, so give us a measure of grain, and be charitable towards us, for God rewards the charitable","12:89":"He said: \"Do you know what you have done with Joseph and his brother, while you were ignorant","12:90":"They said: \"Are you indeed Joseph?\" He said: \"I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God has been gracious to us. For anyone who reverences and is patient, God will not waste the reward of the good doers","12:91":"They said: \"By God, God has indeed preferred you over us and we have been wrongdoers","12:92":"He said: \"There is no blame on you this day, may God forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy","12:93":"Take this shirt of mine and cast it over the face of my father, and he will have sight; and bring to me all your family","12:94":"Andwhen the caravan departed, their father said: \"I do indeed feel the scent of Joseph, except that you may think me senile","12:95":"They said: \"By God, you are back to your old misguidance","12:96":"Then, when the bearer of good news came, he cast it over his face and he regained sight. He said: \"Did I not tell you that I know from God what you do not know","12:97":"They said: \"Our father, ask forgiveness for our sins, indeed we were wrongdoers","12:98":"He said: \"I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful","12:99":"So when they entered upon Joseph, he took his parents to him and he said: \"Enter Egypt, God willing, in security","12:100":"And he raised his parents upon the throne, and they fell in prostration to Him. And he said: \"My father, this is the interpretation of my vision from before. My Lord has made it true, and He has been good to me that he took me out of prison and brought you out of the wilderness after the devil had made bitterness between me and my brothers. My Lord is Kind to whom He wills. He is the Knowledgeable, the Wise","12:101":"My Lord, You have given me sovereignty and taught me the interpretation of the narrations. Initiator of the heavens and the earth, You are my protector in this world and the Hereafter. Let me die as one who has submitted, and join me with the good doers","12:102":"Thatis from the news of the unseen that We inspire to you. You were not among them when they arranged their plan and were scheming","12:103":"And most of the people, even if you are diligent, will not believe","12:104":"And you are not asking them for any wage, it is but a reminder to the worlds","12:105":"And how many a sign in the heavens and the earth do they pass by, while they are turning away from it","12:106":"And most of them will not believe in God except while setting up partners","12:107":"Are they secure against the coming of an enveloping retribution from God, or that the Hour will come to them suddenly while they do not perceive","12:108":"Say:\"This is my way, I invite to God in full disclosure, myself and whoever follows me. And glory be to God; and I am not of the polytheists","12:109":"And We have not sent before you except men, to whom We gave inspiration, from the people of the towns. Will they not roam the earth and see how was the punishment of those before them? And the abode of the Hereafter is far better for those who are aware. Do you not comprehend","12:110":"Then, when the messengers gave up, and they thought that they have been denied, Our victory came to them. We then save whom We wish, and Our punishment cannot be swayed from the wicked people","12:111":"In their stories is a lesson for those who possess intelligence. It is not a narration that has been invented, but an authentication of what is between his hands and a detailing of all things, and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe","13:1":"ALMR, these are the signs of the Book. And what has been sent down to you from your Lord is the truth; but most of the people do not believe","13:2":"God, Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you can see, then He settled upon the Throne, and He commissioned the sun and the moon, each running for an appointed term. He manages all affairs, and He details the signs so that you will be aware of the meeting with your Lord","13:3":"And He is the One who has spread out the land, and made in it stabilizers and rivers, and all the fruits He made in pairs. The night covers the day. In that are signs for a people who think","13:4":"And on the earth are neighboring pieces of land with gardens of grapes and plants and palm trees, some of which may be twin sharing the same root, or single, even though they are being watered with the same water source; and We make preference for some of them over others in what they consume. In that are signs for a people who comprehend","13:5":"And if you are surprised, then what is more surprising is their saying: \"Can it be that when we are dust, we will be created anew!\" These are the ones who have rejected their Lord, and they will have shackles around their necks, and they are the dwellers of the Fire, in it they will abide","13:6":"And they hasten towards you with evil before good, and the examples of those before them have already been given. And your Lord is with forgiveness towards the people for their transgression, and your Lord is severe in retribution","13:7":"And those who reject say: \"If only a sign was sent down to him from his Lord.\" You are but a warner, and to every people is a guide","13:8":"God knows what every female carries, and how short her pregnancy is or how long. And everything with Him is measured","13:9":"The Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Great, the Most High","13:10":"It is the same whether any of you openly declares what he says, or conceals it; whether he is hiding in the night or going openly in the day","13:11":"Present with him and behind him are retainers, they preserve him from the command of God. God does not change the condition of a people until they change the condition of their souls. And if God wanted to harm a people, then there is no turning Him back, nor will they have any protector against Him","13:12":"He is the One who shows you the lightning, giving you fear and hope. And He establishes the heavy clouds","13:13":"Andthe thunder glorifies His praise, and the angels are in awe of Him, and He sends the thunderbolts, and strikes with them whom He wills. Yet they are still arguing regarding God, while He is severe in punishment","13:14":"To Him is the call of truth. And those who are called on besides Him, they will not respond to them in anything; like one who places his hands openly in the water to drink, except it never reaches his mouth. The call of the rejecters is nothing but in misguidance","13:15":"Andto God will prostrate all who are in the heavens and the earth, willingly and unwillingly, as do their shadows in the morning and the evening","13:16":"Say: \"Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?\" Say: \"God.\" Say: \"Have you taken besides Him allies who do not possess for themselves any benefit or harm?\" Say: \"Is the blind and the seer the same? Or do the darkness and the light equate? Or have they set up partners with God who have created like His creation, so the creations all seemed the same to them?\" Say: \"God has created all things, and He is the One, the Supreme","13:17":"He sends down water from the sky, so valleys flow according to their capacity, and the flood produces foam. And from what they burn to smelt jewelry or goods is produced a similar foam. It is in such a manner that God strikes the falsehood with the truth. As for the foam, it passes away, and as for what benefits the people, it remains in the earth. It is such that God puts forth the examples","13:18":"Forthose who have responded to their Lord is goodness. As for those who have not responded to Him, if they had all that is on the earth twice over, they would ransom it to be saved. For these will be a terrible reckoning, and their abode is Hell; what a miserable abode","13:19":"Is he who knows that the truth has been sent down to you from your Lord like he who is blind? Only those who possess intelligence will remember","13:20":"Those who fulfill the pledge of God, and they do not break the covenant","13:21":"Andthose who deliver what God has ordered to be delivered, and they are concerned towards their Lord and they fear a terrible reckoning","13:22":"Andthose who are patient seeking the face of their Lord; and they hold the contact prayer, and they spend from what We have bestowed upon them secretly and openly, and they counter evil with good; these will have an excellent abode","13:23":"The gardens of delight; which they will enter with those who are good doers from their fathers and their mates and their progeny. And the angels will enter upon them from every gate","13:24":"Peace be upon you for what you have been patient for. Excellent indeed is the final abode","13:25":"As for those who break their pledge with God after having made its covenant, and they withhold what God has ordered to be delivered, and they cause corruption on the earth; upon those is a curse and they will have a miserable abode","13:26":"Godgives the provisions for whom He wishes, and He is Capable. And they were happy with the worldly life, but the worldly life compared to the Hereafter is nothing except a brief enjoyment","13:27":"Andthose who have rejected say: \"If only a sign were sent down to him from his Lord!\" Say: \"God misguides whom He wishes and guides to Him whoever is repenting","13:28":"The ones who have believed, and their hearts are relieved by the remembrance of God; for in the remembrance of God the hearts are relieved","13:29":"The ones who have believed, and have done good works, there will be happiness for them and a wonderful abode","13:30":"Thus, We have sent you to a nation, as with other nations before it, so that you may recite to them that which has been inspired to you; while they are still rejecting the Almighty. Say: \"He is my Lord, there is no god except He, in Him I place my trust and to Him is my repentance","13:31":"Andif a revelation were to be used to move mountains, or to slice the earth, or the dead were spoken to with it! Indeed, to God are all matters. Did not those who have believed know that if God had wished He would have guided all the people? As for those who reject, they continue to be stricken with disaster or it comes near to their homes, until the promise of God comes true. God does not break the appointment","13:32":"Andmessengers before you were mocked, but I gave time to those who had rejected, then I took them; so how was My punishment","13:33":"It is He who is standing upon every soul for what it has earned; yet they set up partners with God. Say: \"Name them?\" Or are you informing Him of what He does not know on the earth or is it just a show of words? Indeed, to the rejecters, their scheming is made to appear pleasing, and they are repelled from the path. And whoever God misguides will have no guide","13:34":"They will have a punishment in the worldly life, and the punishment of the Hereafter is more difficult. And they will have no defender against God","13:35":"Theexample of the Paradise which the righteous are promised, is that rivers flow beneath it, and its provisions are continuous as is its shade. Such is the abode of those who were righteous, while the abode of the rejecters is the Fire","13:36":"Andthose to whom We have previously given the Book rejoice at what has been sent down to you, but there are some from the Confederates who reject parts of it. Say: \"I am only ordered to serve God and not set up any partner with Him. Towards Him I implore and towards Him is the return","13:37":"Andas such, We have sent it down a law which is in Arabic. And if you follow their desires after what has come to you of the knowledge, then you will not have any ally or defender against God","13:38":"AndWe have sent messengers before you and We have made for them mates and offspring. It was not for a messenger to come with any sign except with the permission of God; for each period there is a Book","13:39":"Goderases and confirms what He wishes, and with Him is the source of the Book","13:40":"Andif We show you some of what We promise them, or We terminate your life, then you are only to deliver while for Us is the reckoning","13:41":"Do they not see that We come to the land and reduce it from its ends? And God gives judgment and there is none to override His judgment. And He is swift to reckoning","13:42":"Andthose before them had schemed, but to God is all scheming. He knows what every soul earns and the rejecters will come to know to whom is the better abode","13:43":"Andthose who reject say: \"You are not a messenger.\" Say: \"God is enough as a witness between me and you; the One who has the knowledge of the Book","14:1":"ALR, a Book which We have sent down to you so that you may bring the people out of the darkness and into the light with the permission of their Lord, to the path of the Noble, the Praiseworthy","14:2":"God, to whom belong all that is in the heavens and the earth. And woe to the rejecters from a severe retribution","14:3":"The ones who have preferred the worldly life over the Hereafter, and they repel from the path of God, and they seek to make it crooked. Those are the ones who are in misguidance","14:4":"And We have not sent any messenger except in the language of his people, so he may clarify for them. But God misguides whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills. And He is the Noble, the Wise","14:5":"And We sent Moses with Our signs: \"You shall bring your people out of the darkness and into the light, and remind them of the days of God.\" In this are signs for everyone patient and thankful","14:6":"And Moses said to his people: \"Remember the blessings of God upon you that He saved you from the people of Pharaoh; they were afflicting you with the worst punishment, and they used to slaughter your children, and rape your women. And in that was a great test from your Lord","14:7":"And your Lord proclaimed: \"If you give thanks, I will increase for you, but if you are rejecting, then My retribution is severe","14:8":"And Moses said: \"If you reject, you and all who are on the earth together, then know that God is Rich, Praiseworthy","14:9":"Did not news come to you of those before you: the people of Noah, and 'Aad, and Thamud, and those after them whom none know except God? Their messengers came to them with clarity, but they placed their hands onto their mouths and said: \"We are rejecting what you have been sent with, and we are in doubt as to what you are inviting us to","14:10":"Their messengers said: \"Is there doubt regarding God, the initiator of the heavens and the earth? He invites you so that He may forgive some of your sins, and delay you to an appointed term.\" They said: \"You are merely human beings like us; you wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to serve. So come to us with a clear proof","14:11":"Their messengers said: \"We are indeed human beings like you, but God will bestow His grace upon whom He pleases from His servants. And it is not up to us to bring you proof except with the permission of God. And in God the believers should place their trust","14:12":"And why should we not place our trust in God, when He has guided us in our paths. And we will be patient to the harm you inflict upon us. And in God those who trust should place their trust","14:13":"Andthose who rejected said to their messengers: \"We will expel you from our land, or you will return to our creed.\" It was then that their Lord inspired to them: \"We will destroy the wicked","14:14":"And We will let you reside in the land after them. That is for those who fear My station and fear My warning","14:15":"Andthey sought victory, and every arrogant tyrant was then made to lose","14:16":"From behind him is Hell, and he will be poured from a putrid water","14:17":"He tries to drink it, but it cannot be swallowed, and death comes to him from everywhere, but he will not die; and from behind him is a powerful retribution","14:18":"Theexample of those who reject their Lord is that their works are like ashes, upon which the wind blows strongly on a stormy day, they cannot get anything of what they earned. Such is the farthest misguidance","14:19":"Didyou not see that God created the heavens and the earth with the truth? If He wished, He would remove you and bring a new creation","14:20":"Andthat for God is not difficult to do","14:21":"Andthey appeared before God, all of them. And the weak ones said to those who were arrogant: \"We were following you, so will you avail us anything from the retribution of God?\" They said: \"If God had guided us, then we would have guided you. It makes no difference if we cry out or are patient, for we have no refuge","14:22":"Andthe devil said when the matter was complete: \"God had promised you the promise of truth, and I promised you and broke my promise. And I had no power over you except that I invited you and you responded to me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves; I cannot help you nor can you help me. I reject that you have set me up as a partner before this; the wicked will have a painful retribution","14:23":"Andthose who believed and did good works were admitted to estates with rivers flowing beneath them. In them they will abide with the permission of their Lord. Their greeting therein is \"Peace","14:24":"Have you not seen how God puts forth the example that a good word is like a good tree, whose root is firm and whose branches are in the sky","14:25":"It bears its fruit every so often with the permission of its Lord; and God puts forth the examples for the people, perhaps they will remember","14:26":"Andthe example of a bad word is like a tree which has been uprooted from the surface of the earth, it has nowhere to settle","14:27":"Godmakes firm those who believe with firm sayings in the worldly life, and in the Hereafter.

When one of them or both of them reach old age, do not say to them a word of disrespect nor shout at them, but say to them a kind saying","17:24":"And lower for them the wing of humility through mercy, and say: \"My Lord, have mercy upon them as they have raised me when I was young","17:25":"Your Lord is fully aware of what is in your souls. If you are good, then He is to the obedient a Forgiver","17:26":"And give the relative his due, and the poor, and the wayfarer; and do not waste excessively","17:27":"Those who waste excessively are brothers to the devils, and the devil was to his Lord a rejecter","17:28":"And if you turn away from them to seek a mercy from your Lord which you desire, then say to them a gentle saying","17:29":"And do not make your hand stingy by holding it to your neck, nor shall you lay it fully open so you become in despair and regret","17:30":"Your Lord lays out openly the provision for whom He wishes, and He is able to do so. He is Expert and Seer over His servants","17:31":"And do not kill your children out of concern of poverty; We shall provide for you and them. The killing of them was a big mistake","17:32":"And do not come near adultery, for it is immoral and an evil path","17:33":"And do not take a life, for God has made this forbidden, except in the course of justice. And whoever is killed innocently, then We have given his heir authority, so let him not transgress in the taking of a life, for He will be given victory","17:34":"And do not come near the money of the orphan, except for that which is best, until he reaches his independence. And fulfill the pledge, for the pledge brings great responsibility","17:35":"And give full measure when you deal, and weigh with a balance that is straight. That is good and better in the end","17:36":"And do not uphold what you have no knowledge of; for the hearing, eyesight, and heart - all these you are responsible for","17:37":"And do not walk in the land arrogantly, for you will not penetrate the earth, nor will you reach the mountains in height","17:38":"All of this is bad, and disliked by your Lord","17:39":"That is from what your Lord has inspired to you of the wisdom. And do not make with God another god, or you will be cast into Hell, blameworthy and regretting","17:40":"Has your Lord preferred for you the males, while He takes the females as angels? You are indeed saying a grave thing","17:41":"And We have dispatched in this Qur'an that they may remember, but it only increases their aversion","17:42":"Say: \"If there had been gods with Him as they say, then they would have tried to gain a way to the Throne","17:43":"Be He glorified and exalted above what they say, a great falsehood","17:44":"He is glorified by the seven heavens and the earth and that which is in them, and there is not a thing except it glorifies His praise, but you do not comprehend their glorification. He is Compassionate, Forgiving","17:45":"And when you read the Qur'an, We place between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter an invisible barrier","17:46":"And we place shields over their hearts, that they should not understand it, and a deafness in their ears. And if you mention your Lord in the Qur'an alone, they run away turning their backs in aversion","17:47":"We are fully aware of what they are listening to, for they are listening to you but while they are in private counsel the wicked say: \"You are following a man who is bewitched","17:48":"See how they put forth the examples for you. They have gone astray, and cannot come to the path","17:49":"And they said: \"When we are bones and fragments, will we then be resurrected to a new creation","17:50":"Say: \"Even if you be stones or metal","17:51":"Or a creation that is held dear in your chests.\" They will say: \"Who will return us?\" Say: \"The One who initiated you the first time.\" They will shake their heads to you and say: \"When is this?\" Say: \"Perhaps it is near","17:52":"The Day He calls you and you respond by His grace, and you think that you only stayed a little while","17:53":"And say to My servants to speak that which is best. The devil makes bitterness between them. The devil is to man a clear enemy","17:54":"Your Lord is fully aware of you, if He wishes He will have mercy on you, or if He wishes He will punish you. And We have not sent you as a guardian over them","17:55":"And your Lord is fully aware of who is in the heavens and the earth. And We have preferred some prophets over others, and We gave David the Psalms","17:56":"Say: \"Call on those you have claimed besides Him. For they have no power to remove harm from you or shift it","17:57":"The ones you call on, they are themselves seeking a path to their Lord which is nearer, and they desire His mercy, and they fear His retribution. The retribution of your Lord is to be feared","17:58":"And there is not a town before the Day of Resurrection that We will not destroy it, or punish it with a severe punishment. This has been written in the record","17:59":"And what stopped Us from sending the signs except that the previous people disbelieved in them. And We sent to Thamud the camel with foresight, but they did her wrong. And We do not send the signs except to make them fearful","17:60":"And when We said to you: \"Your Lord has encompassed the people.\" And We did not make the vision that We showed you except as a test for the people, and the tree that was cursed in the Qur'an. And We are making them fearful, but it only increases their transgression","17:61":"And We said to the angels: \"Yield to Adam.\" So they yielded except for Satan, he said: \"Shall I yield to one you have created from clay","17:62":"He said: \"Shall I show You this one whom You have preferred over me, that if You respite me until the Day of Resurrection, I will seize his progeny, except for a few","17:63":"He said: \"Go, and whoever follows you from them. Hell shall be the reward to you all, a reward well deserved","17:64":"And entice whoever you can of them with your voice, and mobilize all your forces and men against them, and you may share with them in their money and children, and promise them.\" But the devil promises nothing but deceit","17:65":"As for My servants, you will have no power over them.\" And your Lord is enough as a Caretaker","17:66":"Your Lord is the One Who drives the ships for you in the sea so that you may seek of His bounty. He is Merciful towards you","17:67":"And if harm should afflict you at sea, then all those whom you called on besides Him suddenly vanish from you except for Him. So when He saves you to dry land, you turn away. Man is ever rejecting","17:68":"Are you confident that He will not cause this side of the land to swallow you up, or that He would not send a violent storm against you? Then you will find no caretaker for yourselves","17:69":"Or are you confident that He would not send you back again in it, then He would send against you a violent wind and cause you to drown for your rejection? Then you will not find a second chance with Us","17:70":"And We have honored the Children of Adam and carried them in the land and the sea, and We have provided for them of the good things, and We have preferred them over many of those We created in a marked preference","17:71":"The Day We call every people by their beacon.

And then you would not find for yourself any victor against Us","17:76":"And they nearly intimidated you so they could drive you out of the land. But then they would have been destroyed shortly after you were gone","17:77":"Such was the way of those whom We had sent before you of Our messengers. And you will not find any change in Our way","17:78":"Hold the contact prayer till the setting of the sun; to the murkiness of the night; and the Qur'an at dawn - the Qur'an at dawn is witnessed","17:79":"And from the night, as an addition, you shall reflect upon it for yourself, perhaps your Lord would grant you a station that is praiseworthy","17:80":"And say: \"My Lord, admit me an entrance of truth and let me exit an exit of truth, and grant me from Yourself a support to victory","17:81":"And say: \"The truth has come and falsehood has perished. Falsehood is always bound to perish","17:82":"And We send down from the Qur'an what is a healing and mercy to the believers. And it only increases the wicked in their loss","17:83":"And if We bless man, he turns away and turns his side. But when adversity touches him, he is despairing","17:84":"Say: \"Let each work according to his own. Your Lord is fully aware of who is best guided to the path","17:85":"And they ask you concerning the Spirit. Say: \"The Spirit is from the authority of my Lord; and the knowledge you were given was but very little","17:86":"And if We wished, We would take away that which We have inspired to you. Then you would not find for yourself with it against Us a caretaker","17:87":"Except for a mercy from your Lord. His grace upon you has been great","17:88":"Say: \"If all mankind and the Jinn were to gather to bring a Qur'an like this, they could not come with its like, even if they were helping one another","17:89":"And We have dispatched to the people in this Qur'an from every example, but most of the people refuse to be anything but rejecters","17:90":"And they said: \"We will not believe unto you until you cause a spring of water to burst out of the ground","17:91":"Or that you have an estate of palm trees and grapes, and you cause gushing rivers to burst through it","17:92":"Or that you make the heaven fall upon us in pieces as you claimed, or that you bring God and the angels before us","17:93":"Or that you have a luxurious home, or that you can ascend into the heavens. And we will not believe in your ascension unless you bring for us a book that we can read.\" Say: \"Glory be to my Lord. Am I anything other than a human messenger","17:94":"And what stopped the people from believing when the guidance came to them, except that they said: \"Has God sent a human messenger","17:95":"Say: \"If the earth had angels walking about in security, We would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as a messenger","17:96":"Say: \"God suffices as a witness between me and you.

And We gather them on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, mute, and deaf; their abode will be Hell. Every time it dies down, We increase for them the fire","17:98":"Such is their recompense that they rejected Our revelations, and they said: \"If we are bones and fragments, will we be sent into a new creation","17:99":"Did they not see that God who has created the heavens and the earth is able to create their like? And He has made an appointed time for them in which there is no doubt.

And man was always stingy","17:101":"And We had given Moses nine clear signs. So ask the Children of Israel, when he came to them, then Pharaoh said: \"I think that you Moses are bewitched","17:102":"He said: \"You know that no one has sent these down except for the Lord of the heavens and the earth as visible proofs. And I think that you Pharaoh are doomed","17:103":"So he wanted to entice them out of the land. But We drowned him and all those with him","17:104":"And We said after him to the Children of Israel: \"Dwell on the earth, then, when the time of the second promise comes, We will bring you all together as a mixed crowd","17:105":"And it is with the truth that We have sent it down, and with the truth it came down. And We have not sent you except as a bearer of good news and a warner","17:106":"And a revelation that We have separated, so that you may read it to the people over time; and We have brought it down gradually","17:107":"Say: \"Believe in it or do not believe in it. Those who have been given the knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, they fall to their chins prostrating","17:108":"And they say: \"Praise be to our Lord. Truly, the promise of our Lord was fulfilled","17:109":"And they fall upon their chins crying, and it increases them in humility","17:110":"Say: \"Call on God or call on the Almighty; by whichever you call on, to Him are the best names.\" And do not be too loud in making your contact prayer, nor too quiet; but seek a path in between","17:111":"And say: \"Praise be to God who has not taken a son, nor does He have a partner in sovereignty, nor does He have an ally out of weakness.\" And magnify Him greatly","18:1":"Praise be to God who has sent down the Book to His servant, and He has not made in it any crookedness","18:2":"It is valuable, giving warning of the severe punishment from Him; and it gives glad tidings to the believers who do good works, that they will have an excellent reward","18:3":"In which they will remain eternally","18:4":"And to warn those who said: \"God has taken a son","18:5":"They have no knowledge of this, nor do their fathers. Tremendous indeed is the word coming out of their mouths. They are but saying a lie","18:6":"Perhaps you will torment yourself in grief over them, because they will not believe in this narrative at all","18:7":"We have made what is on the earth an adornment for them, so that We will test them as to which of them is best in works","18:8":"And We will surely make what is on it completely barren","18:9":"Did you perceive that the dwellers of the cave and the numbers related were of Our wondrous signs","18:10":"When the youths hid in the cave, and they said: \"Our Lord, bring us a mercy from Yourself, and help us in our affair","18:11":"So We sealed their ears in the cave for many years","18:12":"Then We sent them to know which of the two groups had remained for as long as they stayed","18:13":"We tell to you their news with the truth. They were youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance","18:14":"And We made firm their hearts when they stood and said: \"Our Lord, the Lord of the heavens and the earth, we will not call besides Him any god. If we have done so then it was in error","18:15":"Here are our people, they have taken gods besides Him, while they do not come with any clear authority. Who then is more wicked than he who invents lies about God","18:16":"So when you withdraw from them and what they serve besides God, seek refuge in the cave, and your Lord will spread His mercy upon you and prepare for your problem a solution","18:17":"And you see the sun when it rises, it visits their cave from the right, and when it sets, it touches them from the left, while they are in an enclosure from it. That is from the signs of God. Whoever God guides is the guided one, and whoever He misguides, you will not find for him any ally to give direction","18:18":"And you would think they are awake while they are asleep. And We turn them on the right-side and on the left-side, and their dog has his arms outstretched at the threshold. If you looked upon them you would have run away from them and you would have been filled with terror from them","18:19":"And it was thus that We delivered them so they would ask themselves. A speaker from among them said: \"How long have you stayed?\" They said: \"We stayed a day or part of a day.\" He said: \"Your Lord is surely aware how long you stayed, so send one of you with these stamped coins of yours to the city, and let him see which is the tastiest food, and let him come with a provision of it. And let him be careful and let no one notice you","18:20":"If they discover you, they will stone you or return you to their creed. Then you will never be successful","18:21":"And as such, We revealed their case so that they would know that the promise of God is true and that there is no doubt regarding the Hour. They argued among themselves regarding them, so they said: \"Erect a monument for them!\" Their Lord is fully aware of them, those who managed to win the argument said: \"We will construct a temple over them","18:22":"They will say: \"Three, the fourth is their dog.\" And they say: \"Five, the sixth is their dog,\" guessing at what they do not know. And they say: \"Seven, and the eighth is their dog.\" Say: \"My Lord is fully aware of their number, none know them except for a few.\" So do not argue regarding them except with proof, and do not seek information regarding them from anyone","18:23":"And do not simply say of something: \"I will do this tomorrow","18:24":"Except if God wills.\" And remember your Lord if you forget and say: \"Perhaps my Lord will guide me to what is nearer than this in wisdom","18:25":"And they remained in their cave for three hundred years, and increased by nine","18:26":"Say: \"God is fully aware how long they remained, to Him is the unseen of the heavens and the earth, He sees and hears. They do not have besides Him any ally, and He does not share in His judgment with anyone","18:27":"And recite what has been inspired to you from the Book of your Lord, there is no changing His words, and you will not find besides Him any refuge","18:28":"And have patience upon yourself regarding those who call on their Lord at dawn and dusk seeking His face, and let not your eyes overlook them that you seek the beauty of this worldly life. And do not obey he whom We have made his heart heedless of Our remembrance and he followed his desire, and his fate was lost","18:29":"And say: \"The truth is from your Lord, so let whoever desires believe, and whoever desires reject.\" We have prepared for the wicked a Fire whose walls will be surrounding them. And if they cry out, they are given a water like boiling oil which burns their faces. What a dreadful drink and what a miserable place","18:30":"Those who believe and do good works, We do not waste the reward of those who have done good work","18:31":"They will have gardens of delight with rivers flowing beneath them, and they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and they will wear green garments of fine silk. They will sit in it on raised thrones. Beautiful is the reward, and beautiful is the dwelling","18:32":"And give them the example of two men: We made for one of them two gardens of grapes, and We surrounded them with palm trees, and We made crops in their midst","18:33":"Each of the two gardens brought forth its produce, and none failed in the least. And We caused a river to gush through them","18:34":"And he had fruit, so he said to his friend while discussing with him: \"I am better off than you financially, and of great influence","18:35":"And he went back into his garden while he had wronged himself. He said: \"I do not think that this will ever perish","18:36":"And I do not think that the Hour is coming. And if I am indeed returned to my Lord, then I will surely find even better things for me","18:37":"His friend said to him while discussing with him: \"Have you disbelieved in the One who has created you from dust, then from a seed, then He evolved you into a man","18:38":"But He is God, my Lord, and I do not set up any partners at all with my Lord","18:39":"And if you enter your garden, you should say: 'Thisis what God has given, there is no power except by God.' You see me as being less than you in wealth and in children","18:40":"Perhaps my Lord will give me better than your garden, and He will send upon it a tornado from the sky, so it becomes completely barren","18:41":"Or that its water becomes deep under-ground, so you will not be capable of seeking it","18:42":"So his fruits were ruined, and he began turning his hands at that which he had spent on it while it remained destroyed upon its branches. And he said: \"I wish I had not set up any partner with my Lord","18:43":"And he had no group which could help against God, and he would not have had victory","18:44":"Such is the true authority of God. He is best to reward, and best to end","18:45":"And give them the example of this worldly life is like a water which We have sent down from the sky, so that the plants of the earth mix with it and it becomes murky being moved by the wind. And God is capable of all things","18:46":"Wealth and sons are a beauty of this worldly life. But the good deeds that remain behind are better with your Lord for a reward, and better for hope","18:47":"And the Day We move the mountains, and you see the earth level, and We gather them; so We will not leave out anyone of them","18:48":"And they are displayed before your Lord as a column: \"You have come to Us as We had created you the first time. No, you claimed We would not makefor you an appointed time","18:49":"And the record was displayed, so you see the criminals fearful of what is in it. And they say: \"Woe to us! What is with this record that it does not leave out anything small or large but has counted it.\" And they found what they had done present. And your Lord does not wrong anyone","18:50":"And We said to the angels: \"Yield to Adam.\" So they all yielded except for Satan. He was of the Jinn, he disobeyed the order of his Lord. Will you take him and his progeny as allies besides Me, while they are your enemy? Miserable for the transgressors is the substitute","18:51":"I did not make them witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor the creation of themselves. Nor do I take the misleaders as helpers","18:52":"The Day when He says: \"Call on your partners that you had claimed.\" So they called them, but they did not respond to them. And We made between them a barrier","18:53":"And the criminals saw the Fire, and they realized they will be placed in it, and they did not find any way to avert it","18:54":"And We have dispatched in this Qur'an for the people from every example; but man has always been most argumentative","18:55":"And what prevented the people from believing when the guidance came to them, and to seek forgiveness from their Lord? Are they waiting for what happened to the people of old to come to them, or that the retribution be brought to them face to face","18:56":"And We do not send the messengers except as bearers of good news and warners. But those who reject will argue using falsehood to overshadow the truth with it. And they took My revelations and what they have been warned by for mockery","18:57":"And who is more wicked than he who was reminded of the revelations of his Lord but he turned away from them, and he forgot what his hands had done. We have made veils upon their hearts from understanding it, and a deafness in their ears. And if you invite them to the guidance, they will never be guided","18:58":"And your Lord is forgiving, with mercy. If He were to evaluate the people for what they had already earned, He would hasten for them the retribution. No, they have an appointment, beyond which they will find no escape","18:59":"And those towns, We destroyed them when they transgressed. And We made for their destruction an appointed time","18:60":"And Moses said to his youth: \"I will not stop until I reach the junction of the two seas, or I spend a lifetime trying","18:61":"But when they reached the junction that was in-between, they forgot their fish, and it was able to make its way back to the sea in a stream","18:62":"And when they passed further on, he said to his youth: \"Bring us our lunch; we have found much fatigue in this journey of ours","18:63":"He said: \"Do you remember when we rested upon the rock? I forgot the fish, and it was the devil who made me forget to remember it. It made its way back to the sea amazingly","18:64":"He said: \"That is what we have been seeking!\" So they went back retracing their steps","18:65":"So they came upon a servant of Ours whom We had given him mercy from Us and We had taught him knowledge from Us","18:66":"Moses said to him: \"Can I follow you so that you will teach me from the guidance you have been taught","18:67":"He said: \"You will not be able to have patience with me","18:68":"And how can you be patient about that which you have not been given any news","18:69":"He said: \"You will find me, God willing, to be patient. And I will not disobey any command of yours","18:70":"He said: \"If you follow me, then do not ask about anything until I relate it to you","18:71":"So they ventured forth until they rode in a boat and he made a hole in it. He said: \"Have you made a hole in it to drown its people? You have done something dreadful","18:72":"He said: \"Did I not tell you that you will not be able to have patience with me","18:73":"He said: \"Forgive me for what I forgot, and do not be hard upon my request with you","18:74":"So they ventured forth until they came upon a youth, and he killed him. He said: \"Have you killed an innocent person without justice? You have done something awful","18:75":"He said: \"Did I not tell you that you will not be able to have patience with me","18:76":"He said: \"If I ask you about anything after this, then do not keep me in your company. You will then have a reason over me","18:77":"So they ventured forth until they came to the people of a town. They requested food from its people but they refused to host them. Then they found a wall which was close to collapsing, so he built it. He said: \"If you had wished, you could have asked a wage for it","18:78":"He said: \"For this, we will now part ways. I will inform you of the meanings of those things that you could not have patience over","18:79":"As for the boat, it belonged to some poor people who were working the sea, so I wanted to damage it as there was a king coming who takes every boat by force","18:80":"And as for the youth, his parents were believers, so we were concerned that he would oppress them by his transgression and disbelief","18:81":"So we wanted their Lord to replace for them with one who is better than him in purity and closer to mercy","18:82":"And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphaned boys in the city, and underneath it was a treasure for them, and their father was a good man, so your Lord wanted that they reach their independence and bring out their treasure as a mercy from your Lord. And none of what I have done was of my own accord. That is the meaning of what you could not have patience for","18:83":"And they ask you about the Two Horned One, say: \"I will recite to you a remembrance of him","18:84":"We had facilitated for him in the land, and We had given him the means to all things","18:85":"So he followed the means","18:86":"Until he reached the setting of the sun; he found it setting at a hot spring, and he found a people near it. We said: \"O Two Horned One, either you shall punish, or you shall do them good","18:87":"He said: \"As for he who has done wrong, we will punish him then he will be returned to his Lord and He will punish him an awful punishment","18:88":"And as for he who believes and does good, then he will have the reward of goodness, and we will speak to him simply of our plan","18:89":"Then he followed the means","18:90":"So when he reached the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We did not make any cover except it","18:91":"So it was, and We knew ahead of time about what he intended","18:92":"Then he followed the means","18:93":"Until he reached the area between the two barriers, he found no one besides them except a people who could barely understand anything said","18:94":"They said: \"O Two Horned One, Gog and Magog are destroyers of the land, so shall we make a tribute for you that you will make between us and them a barrier","18:95":"He said: \"What my Lord has given me is far better. So help me with strength and I will make between you and them a barrier","18:96":"Bring me iron ore.\" Until he leveled between the two walls, he said: \"Blow,\" until he made it a furnace, he said: \"Bring me tar so I can pour it over","18:97":"So they could not come over it, and they could not make a hole in it","18:98":"He said: \"This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord comes, He will make it rubble. And thepromise of my Lord is truth","18:99":"And We left them until that day to surge like waves on one another. And the horn was blown, so We gathered them together","18:100":"And We displayed Hell on that Day to the rejecters openly","18:101":"Those whose eyes were covered against My remembrance, and they were unable to hear","18:102":"Did those who reject think that they could take My servants as allies besides Me? We have prepared Hell for the rejecters as a dwelling","18:103":"Say: \"Shall we inform you of the greatest losers","18:104":"Those whose efforts in the worldly life were wasted while they thought they were doing good","18:105":"These are the ones who rejected the revelations of their Lord and His meeting. So their works were in vain, and We will not give them any value on the Day of Resurrection","18:106":"That is their recompense, Hell; for what they rejected and for taking My revelations and My messengers for mockery","18:107":"Those who believe and do good works, they will have the gardens of Paradise as a dwelling","18:108":"Abiding therein. They will not want to be moved from it","18:109":"Say: \"If the sea were an inkwell for the words of my Lord, then the sea would run out before the words of my Lord run out;\" even if We were to bring another like it as an extension","18:110":"Say: \"I am but a human being like you, being inspired that your god is One god. So whoever looks forward to meeting his Lord, then let him do good works, and not serve anyone besides his Lord","19:1":"KH'YA'S","19:2":"A reminder of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zachariah","19:3":"When he called out to his Lord secretly","19:4":"He said: \"My Lord, my bones have gone frail, and my hair has turned white, and I have never been mischievous in imploring You my Lord","19:5":"And I fear the kinfolk after I am gone, and my wife is infertile, so grant me from Yourself an ally","19:6":"To inherit from me, and inherit from the descendants of Jacob. And make him my Lord, well pleasing","19:7":"O Zachariah, We give you glad tidings of a son whose name is John. We have not given that name before to anyone","19:8":"He said: \"My Lord, how can I have a son when my wife is infertile, and I have reached a very old age","19:9":"He said: \"It is such that your Lord has said. It is an easy thing for Me. And I had created you before, when you were not a thing","19:10":"He said: \"My Lord, make for me a sign.\" He said: \"Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three nights consecutively","19:11":"So he went out among his people from the temple enclosure, and he indicated to them that they should glorify Him at dawn and dusk","19:12":"O John, take the Book with confidence.\" And We gave him authority while in his youth","19:13":"And tenderness from Us, and purity, and he was ever righteous","19:14":"And dutiful to his parents, and never was he a disobedient tyrant","19:15":"And peace be upon him the day he was born, and the day he dies, and the Day he is resurrected alive","19:16":"And relate in the Book, Mary, when she withdrew herself from her family to a place which was to the east","19:17":"So she took a barrier to separate her from them, so We sent Our Spirit to her, and he took on the shape of a human being in all similarity","19:18":"She said: \"I seek refuge with the Almighty from you if you are righteous","19:19":"He said: \"I am the messenger of your Lord, to grant you the gift of a pure son","19:20":"She said: \"How can I have a son when no human being has been with me, nor have I desired such","19:21":"He said: \"It is such that your Lord has said, it is easy for Me. And We shall make him a sign for the people and a mercy from Us. It is a matter already ordained","19:22":"So she was pregnant with him, and she went to deliver in a far place","19:23":"Then the birth pains came to her, by the trunk of a palm tree. She said: \"I wish I had died before this, and became totally forgotten","19:24":"But then he called to her from beneath her: \"Do not be sad, your Lord has made below you a stream","19:25":"And shake the trunk of this palm tree, it will cause ripe dates to fall upon you","19:26":"So eat and drink and be content. If you see any human being, then say: 'I have vowed an abstinence for the Almighty, so I will not talk today to any of mankind","19:27":"Then she came to her people carrying him. They said: \"O Mary, you have come with a thing totally unexpected","19:28":"O sister of Aaron, your father was not a wicked man, and your mother has never been unchaste","19:29":"So she pointed to him. They said: \"How can we talk to someone who is a child in a cradle","19:30":"He said: \"I am a servant of God, He has given me the Book and made me a prophet","19:31":"And He has made me blessed wherever I am, and He has charged me with the contact prayer and purification as long as I am alive","19:32":"And to be dutiful to my mother, and He has not mademe a mischievous tyrant","19:33":"And peace be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the Day I am resurrected alive","19:34":"Such was Jesus, son of Mary, and this is the truth of the matter in which they doubt","19:35":"God was never to take a son, be He glorified. If He decrees a matter, then He simply says to it: 'Be,' and it is","19:36":"And God is my Lord and your Lord, so serve Him. This is a straight path","19:37":"Thus the Confederates disputed between them. Therefore, woe to those who have rejected from the scene of a terrible Day","19:38":"Listen to what they say and watch on the Day they come to Us. But the wicked today are in a clear misguidance","19:39":"And warn them of the Day of Remorse. When the matter is decided while they are oblivious, and they do not believe","19:40":"It is We who will inherit the earth and all that is on it. And to Us they will return","19:41":"And recall in the Book, Abraham; he was a man of truth, a prophet","19:42":"When he said to his father: \"O father, why do you serve what does not hear or see, nor help you in anything","19:43":"My father, knowledge has come to me which did not come to you. So follow me that I will guide you to a level path","19:44":"My father, do not serve the devil. For the devil was ever disobedient to the Almighty","19:45":"My father, I fear that a retribution will inflict you from the Almighty and that you will become an ally to the devil","19:46":"He said: \"Have you abandoned my gods O Abraham? If you do not stop this, I will stone you; and let me be","19:47":"He said: \"Peace be upon you, I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. He has been most kind to me","19:48":"And I will abandon you and what you call on besides God. And I will implore my Lord, hoping that I will not be mischievous in imploring my Lord","19:49":"So when he abandoned them and what they served besides God, We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and each of them We made a prophet","19:50":"And We granted them from Our mercy, and We made for them a tongue of truthfulness to be heard","19:51":"And recall in the Book, Moses; he was loyal, and he was a messenger prophet","19:52":"And We called him from the right side of the mount, and We brought him close to talk with","19:53":"And We granted him from Our mercy his brother Aaron as a prophet","19:54":"And recall in the Book, Ishmael; he was truthful to his promise, and he was a messenger prophet","19:55":"And he used to instruct his family to the contact prayer and purification, and his Lord was pleased with him","19:56":"And recall in the Book, Enoch; he was a man of truth, a prophet","19:57":"And We raised him to a high place","19:58":"Those are the ones whom God has blessed from among the prophets from the progeny of Adam, and those We carried with Noah, and from the progeny of Abraham and Israel, and from whom We have guided and chosen. When the revelations of the Almighty are recited to them, they fall down prostrating, and in tears","19:59":"Then, generations came after them who lost the contact prayer, and followed desires. They will find their consequences","19:60":"Except for whoever repents and believes and does good works; they will be admitted to the Paradise, and they will not be wronged in the least","19:61":"Gardens of delight; that the Almighty had promised His servants in the unseen. His promise must come to pass","19:62":"They will not hear in it any nonsense, only peace. And they will have their provision in it morning and evening","19:63":"Such is the Paradise that We inherit to any of Our servants who are righteous","19:64":"And we are not sent except by the authority of your Lord. To Him are our present and our future, and all that is in-between. And your Lord was never to forget","19:65":"The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them. So serve Him and be patient in His service. Do you know anything that is like Him","19:66":"And man says: \"Can it be that when I am dead, I will be brought out alive","19:67":"Does man not remember that We created him before, when he was not a thing","19:68":"By your Lord, We will gather them and the devils, then We will place them around Hell on their knees","19:69":"Then We will drag out from every clan the ones which were most in opposition to the Almighty","19:70":"Then, it is We who are best aware of those who deserve to be burnt therein","19:71":"And every single one of you will encounter it. This for your Lord is a certainty that will come to pass","19:72":"Then We will save those who were righteous, and We will leave the wicked in it on their knees","19:73":"And when Our clear revelations were recited to them, those who rejected said to those who believed: \"Which of our two groups is in a better station and more prosperous","19:74":"And how many a generation have We destroyed before them? They had more wealth and more influence","19:75":"Say: \"Whoever is in misguidance, then the Almighty will lead them on.\" Until they see what they have been promised, either the retribution or the Hour. Then they will know who is in a worse place and weaker in power","19:76":"And God increases the guidance of those who are guided. And the goodness that endures is better with your Lord as a reward and a far better return","19:77":"Did you see the one who rejected Our revelations and said: \"I will be given wealth and children","19:78":"Did he look into the future? Or has he taken a pledge with the Almighty","19:79":"No, We will record what he says, and We will increase for him the retribution significantly","19:80":"Then We inherit from him all that he said, and he shall come to Us all alone","19:81":"And they have taken gods besides God to be for them their glory","19:82":"On the contrary, they will reject their service of them and they will be standing against them","19:83":"Did you not see that We send the devils upon the rejecters to push them with incitement","19:84":"So do not be in haste towards them; We are preparing for them a preparation","19:85":"The Day We gather the righteous to the Almighty as a delegation","19:86":"And We drive the criminals to Hell as a herd","19:87":"None will possess intercession, except for he who has taken a pledge with the Almighty","19:88":"And they said the Almighty has taken a son","19:89":"You have come with a gross blasphemy","19:90":"The heavens are about to shatter from it, and the earth crack open, and the mountains fall and crumble","19:91":"That they claimed that the Almighty had a son","19:92":"And what need does the Almighty have to take a son","19:93":"When all there is in the heavens and the earth will come to the Almighty as servants","19:94":"He has encompassed them, and counted them one by one","19:95":"And all of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection, all alone","19:96":"Those who believe and do good works, the Almighty will make for them affection","19:97":"Thus We have made this easy in your tongue so that you may give good news with it to the righteous and that you may warn with it the quarrelsome people","19:98":"And how many a generation have We destroyed before them? Do you perceive any of them or hear from them a sound","20:1":"T'H","20:2":"We did not send down to you the Qur'an so you may suffer","20:3":"It is but a reminder for he who is concerned","20:4":"Sent down from the One who has created the earth and the heavens above","20:5":"The Almighty, upon the Throne He settled","20:6":"To Him is what is in the heavens and what is on the earth, and what is between them, and what is beneath the ground","20:7":"And if you will declare openly what you say, then surely He knows the secret and what is hidden","20:8":"God, there is no god except He, to Him are the beautiful names","20:9":"And did the narrative of Moses come to you","20:10":"When he saw a fire, he said to his family: \"Stay here, I have seen a fire, perhaps I can bring a piece from it, or find at the fire some guidance","20:11":"So when he came to it he was called: \"O Moses","20:12":"I am your Lord, so take off your slippers; you are in the holy valley Tuwa","20:13":"And I have chosen you, so listen to what is being inspired","20:14":"I am God, there is no god except Me, so serve Me and hold the contact prayer for My remembrance","20:15":"The Hour is coming, I am nearly keeping it hidden, so that every soul will be recompensed with what it strived","20:16":"So do not be deterred from it by he who does not believe in it and followed his desire and perished","20:17":"And what is in your right hand O Moses","20:18":"He said: \"It is my staff, I lean on it, and I guide my sheep with it, and I have other uses in it","20:19":"He said: \"Cast it down O Moses","20:20":"So he cast it down, and it became a moving serpent","20:21":"He said: \"Take it and do not be fearful, We will turn it back to its previous form","20:22":"And place your hand under your arm, it will come out white without blemish, as another sign","20:23":"This is to show you Our great signs","20:24":"Go to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed","20:25":"He said: \"My Lord, comfort for me my chest","20:26":"And make my mission easy","20:27":"And remove the knot in my tongue","20:28":"So they can understand what I say","20:29":"And allow for me an advisor from my family","20:30":"Aaron, my brother","20:31":"So that I may strengthen my resolve through him","20:32":"And share with him my mission","20:33":"So that we may glorify You plenty","20:34":"And remember You plenty","20:35":"You Have been seer over us","20:36":"He said: \"You have been given what you asked O Moses","20:37":"And We have graced you another time","20:38":"When We inspired to your mother what was inspired","20:39":"That she should cast him in the basket, and cast the basket in the sea, so the sea will place him on the shore, where an enemy of Mine and his will take him. And I placed upon you a love from Me. And that you shall be raised under My eye","20:40":"That your sister should follow, and say: 'Shall I guide you to a person who will nurse him.' Thus We returned you to your mother, so that she may be pleased and not be sad. And you killed a person, but We saved you from harm and We tested you greatly. So it was that you stayed with the people of Midyan for many years, then you came here by fate O Moses","20:41":"And I Have raised you for Myself","20:42":"Go, you and your brother with Our signs, and do not linger from My remembrance","20:43":"Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed","20:44":"So say to him soft words, perhaps he will remember or be concerned","20:45":"They said: \"Our Lord, we fear that he would let loose upon us, or transgress","20:46":"He said: \"Do not fear, I am with you, I hear and I see","20:47":"So come to him and say: \"We are messengers from your Lord, so send with us the Children of Israel, and do not punish them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord, and peace be upon those who follow the guidance","20:48":"It has been inspired to us that the retribution will be upon he who denies and turns away","20:49":"He said: \"So who is the lord of you both O Moses","20:50":"He said: \"Our Lord is the One who gave everything its creation, then guided","20:51":"He said: \"What then has happened to the previous generations","20:52":"He said: \"The knowledge of it is with my Lord, in a record. My Lord does not err or forget","20:53":"The One who made for you the earth habitable and He made ways for you in it, and He brought down water from the sky, so We brought out with it pairs of vegetation of all types","20:54":"Eat and raise your livestock, in that are signs for those of thought","20:55":"From it We created you and in it We return you, and from it We bring you out another time","20:56":"And We showed him Our signs, all of them, but he denied and refused","20:57":"He said: \"Have you come to us to take us out of our land with your magic O Moses","20:58":"We will bring you a magic like it, so let us make an appointment between us and you which neither of us will break, a place where we both agree","20:59":"He said: \"Your appointment is the day of festival, and when the people start crowding during the late morning","20:60":"So Pharaoh went away, and he gathered his plan then he came","20:61":"Moses said to them: \"Woe to you, do not invent lies about God, else the retribution will take you, and miserable is the one who invents","20:62":"So they disputed in their matter between themselves, and they kept private their counsel","20:63":"They said: \"These are but two magicians who want to take you out of your land with their magic, and they want to do away with your ideal way","20:64":"So agree your plan, then come as one front. Whoever wins today will succeed","20:65":"They said: \"O Moses, either you cast down or we will be the first to cast down","20:66":"He said: \"You cast down.\" So their ropes and staffs appeared from their magic as if they were moving","20:67":"And Moses held some fear in himself","20:68":"We said: \"Do not fear, you will best them","20:69":"And cast down what is in your right hand it will consume what they have made. They have only made the plans of a magician, and the magician will not succeed no matter what he does","20:70":"So the magicians went down in prostration. They said: \"We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses","20:71":"He said: \"Have you believed to him before taking my permission? He is surely your great one who has taught you magic. So, I will cut off your hands and feet from alternate sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of the palm trees, and you will come to know which of us is greater in retribution and more lasting","20:72":"They said: \"We will not prefer you over the proofs that have come to us, and over the One who initiated us. So issue whatever judgment you have, for you only issue judgment in this worldly life","20:73":"We have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our wrongdoings, and what you had forced us into doing of magic; and God is better and more lasting","20:74":"He who comes to his Lord as a criminal, he will have Hell, where he will neither die in it nor live","20:75":"And he who comes to Him as a believer doing good works, for those will be the highest ranks","20:76":"Gardens of delight, with rivers flowing beneath them, abiding therein. Such is the reward of he who is developed","20:77":"And We inspired to Moses: \"Take My servants out, and strike for them a path through the sea that is dry. You shall not fear being overtaken, nor be concerned","20:78":"So Pharaoh followed them with his soldiers, but the sea came-over them and covered them","20:79":"Thus, Pharaoh misled his people and he did not guide","20:80":"O Children of Israel, We have saved you from your enemy, and We summoned you at the right side of the mount, and We sent down to you manna and quail","20:81":"Eat from the good things that We have provided for you and do not transgress in this else My wrath will be upon you. Whoever has incurred My wrath is lost","20:82":"And I am forgiving for whoever repents and does good works, then is guided","20:83":"And what has caused you to rush ahead of your people O Moses","20:84":"He said: \"They are coming in my tracks, and I came quickly to you my Lord so you would be pleased","20:85":"He said: \"We have tested your people after you left, and the Sumerian misguided them","20:86":"So Moses returned to his people angry and disappointed. He said: \"My people, did not your Lord promise you a good promise? Has the waiting for the pledge been too long, or did you want that the wrath of your Lord be upon you? Thus you broke the promise with me","20:87":"They said: \"We did not break the promise by our own will, but we were loaded down with the jewelry of the people so we cast them down, and it was such that the Sumerian suggested","20:88":"He then produced for them a sculpture of a calf that emitted a cry. So they said: \"This is your god and the god of Moses, but he had forgotten","20:89":"Did they not see that it did not respond to them? Nor did it possess for them any harm or benefit","20:90":"And Aaron said to them before: \"My people, you are being tested with it. Your Lord is the Almighty, so follow me and obey my command","20:91":"They said: \"We will remain devoted to it until Moses comes back to us","20:92":"He said: \"O Aaron, what prevented you when you saw them being astray","20:93":"Do you not follow me? Have you disobeyed my command","20:94":"He said: \"O son of my mother, do not grab me by my beard nor by my head. I was concerned that you would say that I separated between the Children of Israel, and that I did not follow your orders","20:95":"He said: \"So what do you have to say O Sumerian","20:96":"He said: \"I noticed what they did not notice, so I took a handful from where the messenger was standing, and I cast it in. This is what my soul inspired me to do","20:97":"He said: \"Then be gone, for you will have it in this life to say: \"I am not to be touched\" And you will have an appointed time which you will not forsake. And look to your god that you remained devoted to, we will burn him, then we will destroy him in the sea completely","20:98":"Surely your god is God; for which there is no god except He. His knowledge encompasses all things","20:99":"And it is such that We tell to you the news of what has passed. And We have given you from Us a remembrance","20:100":"Whoever turns away from it, then he will carry a load on the Day of Resurrection","20:101":"They will remain therein; and miserable for them on the Day of Resurrection is what they carry","20:102":"The Day the horn is blown, and We gather the criminals on that Day white eyed","20:103":"They whisper among themselves: \"You have only been away for a period of ten","20:104":"We are fully aware of what they say, for the best among them will say: \"No, you have only been away for a day","20:105":"And they ask you about the mountains, so say: \"My Lord will annihilate them completely","20:106":"Then He will leave it as a smooth plain","20:107":"You will not see in it any crookedness or curves","20:108":"On that Day, they will follow the caller, there is no crookedness to him. And all voices will be humbled for the Almighty, you will not be able to hear except whispers","20:109":"On that Day, no intercession will be of help, except for he whom the Almighty allows and accepts what he has to say","20:110":"He knows their present and their future, and they do not have any of His knowledge","20:111":"And the faces shall be humbled for the Eternal, the Living. And whoever carried wickedness with him has failed","20:112":"And whoever does any good works, while he is a believer, then he should not fear injustice nor being given less than his due","20:113":"And it was such that We sent it down an Arabic revelation, and We dispatched in it the warnings, perhaps they will become aware or it will cause them to remember","20:114":"Then High above all is God, the King, the True. And do not be hasty with the Qur'an before its inspiration is completed to you, and say: \"My Lord, increase my knowledge","20:115":"And We had entrusted to Adam from before, but he forgot, and We did not find in him the will power","20:116":"And We said to the angels: \"Yield to Adam.\" They all yielded except for Satan, he refused","20:117":"So We said: \"O Adam, this is an enemy to you and your mate. So do not let him take you out from the paradise, else you will have hardship","20:118":"You will have in it that you will not go hungry nor need clothes","20:119":"And you will have in it that you will not go thirsty nor suffer from heat","20:120":"But the devil whispered to him, he said: \"O Adam, shall I lead you to the tree of immortality and a kingdom which will not waste away","20:121":"So they both ate from it, and their bodies became apparent to them, and they began to place leaves on themselves from the paradise. Adam had disobeyed his Lord, and had gone astray","20:122":"Then his Lord recalled him, and He forgave him, and gave guidance to him","20:123":"He said: \"Descend from this, all of you, for you are enemies to one another. So, when My guidance comes to you, then, whoever follows My guidance, he will not go astray nor suffer","20:124":"And whoever turns away from My remembrance, then he will have a miserable life, and We will raise him blind on the Day of Resurrection","20:125":"He said: \"My Lord, you have raised me blind while I used to be able to see","20:126":"He said: \"It was the same when Our revelations came to you, you forgot them, and similarly today you will be forgotten","20:127":"And it is such that We recompense he who transgresses, and did not believe in the revelations of his Lord. And the retribution of the Hereafter is more severe and more lasting","20:128":"Is it not a guide to them how many generations We had destroyed before them, which they are walking now in their homes? In that are signs for the people of understanding","20:129":"And had it not been for a word already given by your Lord, they would have been held to account immediately","20:130":"So be patient to what they are saying and glorify the grace of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting, and at the approach of the night - you shall glorify - and at parts of the day, perhaps you may be content","20:131":"And do not crave with your eyes what We have bestowed upon some couples from them; the flower of the worldly life; so as to test them in it; and the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting","20:132":"And instruct your family to the contact prayer, and be patient for it. We do not ask you for provision, for We provide for you. And the ending will be for righteousness","20:133":"And they said: \"If only he would bring us a sign from his Lord!\" Did not proof come to them from what is in the previous scripts","20:134":"And if We had destroyed them with a retribution before this, they would have said: \"Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger so we could follow Your revelations before we are humiliated and shamed","20:135":"Say: \"All are waiting, so wait, and you will come to know who are the people upon the even path and who are guided","21:1":"The judgment for the people has come near, while they are turning away unaware","21:2":"When a reminder comes to them from their Lord that is recent, they listen to it while playing","21:3":"Their hearts are preoccupied, and those who are wicked confer privately: \"Is he not but a human being like you? Would you accept this magic while you know","21:4":"Say: \"My Lord knows what is said in the heavens and on the earth, and He is the Hearer, the Knower","21:5":"They said: \"No, these are just bad dreams; no, he made it up; no, he is a poet. So let him bring us a sign like those who were sent before","21:6":"None of the towns which We destroyed before them had believed. Will they be the ones who believe","21:7":"And We did not send before you except men whom We inspired to. So ask the people of the Reminder if you do not know","21:8":"And We did not make for them bodies that do not need to eat, nor were they immortal","21:9":"Then We fulfilled the promise to them, so We saved them and whom We pleased, and We destroyed those who transgressed","21:10":"We have sent down to you a Book in which is your remembrance. Do you not comprehend","21:11":"And how many a town have We destroyed because it was wicked, and We established after them a different people","21:12":"So it was that when they perceived Our power, they were running from it","21:13":"Donot run, and come back to that which you were living lavishly in and your homes; so that you will be questioned","21:14":"They said: \"Woe to us, we have been wicked","21:15":"So that remained their cry until We took them all, and they became still","21:16":"AndWe did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them for entertainment","21:17":"If We wanted to be amused, We could have done so from what is already with Us, if that is what We wished to do","21:18":"No,We cast with the truth upon the falsehood, so it disrupts it, and then it retreats. And woe to you for what you have described","21:19":"Andto Him is whoever is in the heavens and on the earth. And those who are near Him are not too proud to serve Him, nor do they complain","21:20":"They glorify in the night and the day, they do not cease","21:21":"Or have they taken earthly gods who can resurrect","21:22":"If there were gods in them except for God, then they would have been ruined. Glory be to God, the Lord of the Throne from what they describe","21:23":"He is not questioned about what He does, while they will be questioned","21:24":"Or have they taken gods besides Him? Say: \"Bring your proof. This is a reminder of those with me and a reminder of those before me.\" But, most of them do not know the truth, so they turn away","21:25":"AndWe did not send any messenger before you except that We inspired him that: \"There is no god except Me, so serve Me","21:26":"Andthey said: \"The Almighty has taken a son!\" Be He glorified, they are all but honored servants","21:27":"They do not speak ahead of Him, and on His command they act","21:28":"He knows their present and their future, and they cannot intercede unless it is for those whom He is pleased with. And, from His concern, they are worried","21:29":"Andwhoever of them says: \"I am a god besides Him,\" then that person We will punish with Hell. It is such that We punish the wicked","21:30":"Have those who rejected not seen that the heavens and the earth were one piece, so We split them apart? And that We have made from the water everything that lives. Will they not believe","21:31":"AndWe made on the earth stabilizers so that it would not tumble with you, and We made in it wide paths that they may be guided","21:32":"AndWe made the sky a protective ceiling; and yet, from its signs they are turning away","21:33":"And He is the One who has created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, each swimming in an orbit","21:34":"AndWe did not give immortality to any human being that came before you. If you are going to die, would they be immortal","21:35":"Every soul will taste death. And We burden you with evil and good as a test, and it is to Us that you will return","21:36":"Andwhen those who reject see you, they take you for mockery: \"Is this the one who speaks about your gods!\" While in the remembrance of the Almighty they are rejecters","21:37":"Man has been created from haste. I will show you My signs, so do not be hasty","21:38":"Andthey say: \"When will this promise come to pass if you are truthful","21:39":"If only those who reject knew, that they will not be able to ward off the fire from their faces, nor from their backs, nor will they be helped","21:40":"No,it will come to them suddenly.

Will they be able to win","21:45":"Say: \"I am merely warning you with the inspiration.\" But the deaf do not hear the call when they are being warned","21:46":"Andif a trace of the torment of your Lord touches them, they will say: \"Woe to us, we have been wicked","21:47":"AndWe place the balances of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so that no soul will be wronged in the least. Even if it was the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it. And We are enough as a Reckoner","21:48":"AndWe had given Moses and Aaron the Criterion, a shining light, and reminder for the righteous","21:49":"Those who are concerned towards their Lord in the unseen, and they are weary of the Hour","21:50":"Andthis is a blessed reminder which We have sent down. Will you be deniers of it","21:51":"Andbefore that We gave Abraham his understanding, and We were aware of him","21:52":"As he said to his father and people: \"What are these images to which you are devoted","21:53":"They said: \"We found our fathers worshipping them","21:54":"He said: \"You and your fathers have been clearly misguided","21:55":"They said: \"Have you come to us with the truth, or are you simply playing","21:56":"He said: \"No, your lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the One who initiated them. And I bear witness to such","21:57":"And by God, I will plan against your statues after you have gone away and given your backs","21:58":"So he broke them into pieces except for the biggest of them, so that they may turn to him","21:59":"They said: \"Who has done this to our gods? He is surely one of the wicked","21:60":"They said: \"We heard a young man mentioning them. He was called Abraham","21:61":"They said: \"Bring him before the eyes of the people so that they may be witness","21:62":"They said: \"Did you do this to our gods O Abraham","21:63":"He said: \"It was the biggest one of them here who did it, so ask them, if they do speak","21:64":"So they turned and said to themselves: \"It is indeed ourselves who have been wicked","21:65":"Then they returned to their old ideas: \"You know that they do not speak","21:66":"He said: \"Do you serve besides God that which does not benefit you at all nor harm you","21:67":"I am fed-up of you and to what you serve besides God! Do you not comprehend","21:68":"They said: \"If you are to do anything, then burn him, and give victory to your gods","21:69":"We said: \"O fire, be cool and safe upon Abraham","21:70":"Andthey wanted to plan against him, but We made them the losers","21:71":"AndWe saved him and Lot to the land which We have blessed in for the worlds","21:72":"AndWe granted him Isaac and, as an addition, Jacob.

They were a people of evil, wicked","21:75":"AndWe admitted him into Our mercy. He was of the good doers","21:76":"AndNoah when he called out before that, thus We responded to him, and We saved him and his family from the great distress","21:77":"AndWe granted him victory against the people who denied Our revelations. They were a people of evil, so We drowned them all","21:78":"AndDavid and Solomon, when they gave judgment in the case of the crop that was damaged by the sheep of the people, and We were witness to their judgment","21:79":"So We gave Solomon the correct understanding, and both of them We have given wisdom and knowledge. And We commissioned the mountains with David to praise, and the birds. This is what We did","21:80":"AndWe taught him the making of armor for you to protect you from your enemy. Are you then thankful","21:81":"Andto Solomon the gusting winds run by his command all the way to the land which We have blessed in. And We were aware of everything","21:82":"Andfrom the devils are those who dive for him, and they perform other tasks, and We were guardian over them","21:83":"AndJob when he called his Lord: \"I have been afflicted with harm, and you are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy","21:84":"So We answered him, and We removed what was afflicting him, and We brought him back his family and others with them as a mercy from Us and a reminder to those who serve","21:85":"AndIshmael and Enoch and Isaiah, all of them were patient","21:86":"AndWe admitted them in Our mercy, they were of the good doers","21:87":"Andthe one with 'N,' when he went off in anger, and he thought that We would not be able to take him. Then he called out in the darkness: \"There is no god except You! Glory be to You, I was of the wicked","21:88":"So We responded to him and We saved him from distress. And it is such that We save the faithful","21:89":"AndZachariah when he called out to his Lord: \"My Lord, do not leave me without an heir, and You are the best inheritor","21:90":"So We responded to him, and We granted him John, and We cured his wife.

Indeed, we were wicked","21:98":"Both you and what you serve besides God shall be fuel for Hell; you will enter it","21:99":"If these had been gods, then they would not have entered it! And all will abide therein","21:100":"They will be breathing heavily in it, and they will not be heard therein","21:101":"As for those who deserved good from Us, they will be removed far away from it","21:102":"Theyshall not hear the slightest sound from it, and they will be in what their soul desires abiding therein","21:103":"The great horror will not sadden them, and the angels will receive them: \"This is your Day which you have been promised","21:104":"On the Day when We roll up the heavens like the scroll of a book is rolled up.

God then duplicates what the devil has cast, and God secures His revelations. And God is Knower, Wise","22:53":"That He may make what the devil has cast as a test for those who have a disease in their hearts and those whose hearts are hardened. And the wicked are far away in opposition","22:54":"Andto let those who have been given knowledge knowthat it is the truth from your Lord, and they will believe in it, and their hearts will soften to it.

And God is the Most High, the Great","22:63":"Didyou not see that God sends down water from the sky, and then the land becomes green? God is Compassionate, Expert","22:64":"To Him is what is in the heavens and what is on the earth. And God is the Rich, the Praiseworthy","22:65":"Didyou not see that God commits to you what is on the earth? And the ships sail in the sea with His permission.

And the wicked will not have any helper","22:72":"Andif Our clear revelations are recited to them, you see denial in the faces of those who have rejected. They are nearly close to attacking those who are reciting to them Our revelations! Say: \"Shall I inform you of what is worse than this? The Fire, which God has promised to those who have rejected. What a miserable destiny","22:73":"O people, an example is being put forth so listen to it: those you call upon besides God will not create a fly even if they all gathered to do so.

We give you to drink from what is in its bellies, and you have many other benefits from them, and of them you eat","23:22":"Andon them and on the ships you are carried","23:23":"AndWe have sent Noah to his people, so he said: \"O my people, serve God, you have no other god besides Him. Will you not take heed","23:24":"Butthe leaders who rejected from among his people said: \"What is this but a human being like you? He wants to make himself better than you!

Every time there came to a nation their messenger, they denied him. So We made them follow one another, and We let them become narrations. So away with a people who do not believe","23:45":"Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a clear authority","23:46":"To Pharaoh and his commanders. But they became arrogant, for they were a high and mighty people","23:47":"So they said: \"Shall we believe to two human beings like us, while their people are servants to us","23:48":"So they denied them, and they became of those who were destroyed","23:49":"AndWe have given Moses the Book, so that they may be guided","23:50":"AndWe made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and We gave them refuge on high ground, a place for resting and with a flowing stream","23:51":"O messengers, eat from what is good, and do good work.

He said: \"This is from the work of the devil; he is an enemy that clearly misleads","28:16":"He said: \"My Lord, I have wronged my soul, so forgive me.\" He then forgave him, for He is the Forgiver, the Merciful","28:17":"He said: \"My Lord, for what blessings you have bestowed upon me, I will never be a supporter for the criminals","28:18":"So he spent the night in the city, afraid and watchful. Then the one who sought his help yesterday, was asking again for his help. Moses said to him: \"You are clearly a trouble maker","28:19":"But when he was about to strike their common enemy, he said: \"O Moses, do you want to kill me, as you killed that person yesterday? Obviously, you wish to be a tyrant on the earth; you do not wish to be of the righteous","28:20":"And a man came running from the farthest part of the city, saying: \"O Moses, the commanders are plotting to kill you, so leave immediately. I am giving you good advice","28:21":"He exited the city, afraid and watchful. He said: \"My Lord, save me from the wicked people","28:22":"And as he traveled towards Midyan, he said: \"Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the right path","28:23":"When he arrived at the watering hole of Midyan, he found a crowd of people watering, and he found two women waiting on the side. He said: \"What is holding you back.\" They said: \"We cannot draw water until the shepherds finish, and our father is an old man","28:24":"So he drew water for them, then he turned to a shaded area, and he said: \"My Lord, I am poor, lacking any provisions You may have sent down","28:25":"So one of the two women approached him, shyly, and said: \"My father invites you to reward you for watering for us.\" So when he came to him, and told to him the stories, he said: \"Do not fear, for you have been saved from the wicked people","28:26":"One of the two women said: \"O my father, hire him. For the best to be hired is one who is strong and honest","28:27":"He said: \"I wish you to marry one of my two daughters, on condition that you work for me through eight pilgrimage periods; if you complete them to ten, it will be voluntary on your part. I do not wish to make this matter too difficult for you. You will find me, God willing, of the righteous","28:28":"He said: \"It is then an agreement between me and you. Whichever period I fulfill, you will not be averse to either one. And God is entrusted over what we said","28:29":"So after Moses fulfilled his obligation and was traveling with his family, he saw a fire on the slope of the mount. He said to his family: \"Stay here, I have seen a fire, perhaps I can bring you from there some news or a burning piece of the fire so that you may be warmed","28:30":"So when he reached it, he was called from the edge of the right side of the valley at the blessed area of the tree: \"O Moses, it is I, God, Lord of the worlds","28:31":"And cast down your staff.\" So when he saw it vibrate as if it were a Jinn, he turned around to flee and would not return. \"O Moses, come forward and do not be afraid. You are of those who are safe","28:32":"Place your hand into your pocket. It will come out white without any blemish, and fold your hand close to your side against fear. These are two proofs from your Lord, to Pharaoh and his commanders; for they are a wicked people","28:33":"He said: \"My Lord, I have killed a person from them, so I fear that they will kill me","28:34":"And my brother Aaron is more eloquent in speech than I. So send him with me to help and to confirm me. For I fear that they will deny me","28:35":"He said: \"We will strengthen you with your brother, and We will provide you both with authority. Thus, they will not be able to touch either one of you. With Our signs, the two of you, along with those who follow you, will be the victors","28:36":"So when Moses went to them with Our clear signs, they said: \"This is nothing but fabricated magic; nor did we hear of this from our fathers of old","28:37":"And Moses said: \"My Lord is fully aware of who has come with the guidance from Him, and who will have the best deal in the Hereafter. The wicked never succeed","28:38":"And Pharaoh said: \"O commanders, I have not known of any god for you other than me. Therefore, O Haamaan, fire-up the bricks and make for me a high platform, so perhaps I may take a look at the god of Moses; though I think he is one of the liars","28:39":"And he and his soldiers were arrogant in the land without any right, and they thought that they would not be returned to Us","28:40":"So We took him and his soldiers, and We cast them into the sea. So see how was the end of the wicked","28:41":"We made them leaders, inviting to the Fire. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will not be supported","28:42":"And We made them followed by a curse in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be despised","28:43":"We had given Moses the Book after We had destroyed the earlier generations; as an example for the people and a guidance and a mercy, perhaps they will take heed","28:44":"And you were not on the western slope when We decreed the command to Moses. You were not a witness","28:45":"And We established many generations, and many ages passed them by. And you were not living among the people of Midyan, reciting Our revelations to them. But We were to send messengers","28:46":"And nor were you on the side of the mount when We called. But it is a mercy from your Lord, so that you may warn a people who received no warner before you, perhaps they may take heed","28:47":"Thus, if any disaster strikes them as a consequence of their own deeds they cannot Say: \"Our Lord, if only You sent a messenger to us, so that we would follow Your revelations, and we would be of the believers","28:48":"But when the truth came to them from Us, they said: \"If only he was given the same that was given to Moses!\" Had they not rejected what was given to Moses before? They had said: \"Two magicians assisting one another.\" And they said: \"We reject all these things","28:49":"Say: \"Then bring forth a book from God that is better than them in guidance so I may follow it, if you are truthful","28:50":"But if they fail to respond to you, then know that they follow only their desires. And who is more astray than he who follows his desire, without guidance from God? God does not guide the wicked people","28:51":"And We have delivered the message, perhaps they may take heed","28:52":"Those to whom We had given the Book before this, they will believe in it","28:53":"And if it is recited to them, they say: \"We believe in it. It is the truth from our Lord. Indeed, we had submitted before it","28:54":"To these We grant twice the reward for that they have been patient. And they counter evil with good, and from Our provisions to them, they give","28:55":"And if they come across vain talk, they disregard it and say: \"To us are our deeds, and to you are your deeds. Peace be upon you. We do not seek the ignorant","28:56":"You cannot guide whom you love. But it is God who guides whom He wills; and He is fully aware of those who receive the guidance","28:57":"And they said: \"If we follow the guidance with you, we will be deposed from our land.\" Did We not establish for them a safe territory, to which all kinds of fruits are offered, as a provision from Us? Indeed, most of them do not know","28:58":"And how many a town have We destroyed that had become unappreciative of its livelihood. So here are their dwellings, they remained uninhabited after them, except for a few. And We were the inheritors","28:59":"And your Lord was not to destroy the towns until He sends a messenger to their capital, to recite Our revelations to them. And We do not destroy the towns unless its people are wicked","28:60":"And anything that is given to you is only the materialism of this world, and its glitter. And what is with God is far better, and more lasting. Do you not comprehend","28:61":"Is one whom We promised a good promise, and it will come to pass, equal to one whom We provided with the goods of this life, then on the Day of Resurrection he is of those who will be summoned","28:62":"And on the Day when He calls upon them, saying: \"Where are My partners whom you used to claim","28:63":"Those who have deserved the retribution will say: \"Our Lord, these are the ones we misled; we misled them only because we ourselves were misled. We seek to absolve ourselves to You, it was not us that they worshipped","28:64":"And it will be said: \"Call upon your partners,\" but they will not respond to them. And they will see the retribution. If only they were guided","28:65":"On that Day, He will ask them and say: \"What was the answer you gave to the messengers","28:66":"They will be shocked by the news on that Day, they will be speechless","28:67":"As for the one who repents, believes, and does good works; perhaps he will be with the winners","28:68":"And your Lord creates what He wills, and He selects; it is not for them to select. Glory be to God, He is far above the partners they set up","28:69":"And your Lord knows what is concealed in their chests and what they declare","28:70":"And He is God, there is no god except He. To Him belongs all praise in the first and in the last, and judgment belongs with Him, and to Him you will be returned","28:71":"Say: \"Have you noted: what if God made the night eternal, until the Day of Resurrection? Which god, other than God, can bring you with light? Do you not listen","28:72":"Say: \"Have you noted: what if God made the daylight eternal, until the Day of Resurrection? Which god, other than God, can provide you with night for you to reside in? Do you not see","28:73":"And from His mercy is that He created for you the night and the day; that you may reside in it, and that you may seek of His provisions; and perhaps you may be thankful","28:74":"And the Day He will call them and say: \"Where are My partners whom you had claimed","28:75":"And We will extract from every nation a witness, then We will say: \"Bring forth your proof.\" They will then realize that all truth belongs with God, and what they had invented will abandon them","28:76":"Qaroon was from among the people of Moses, but he betrayed them. And We gave him such treasures that the keys thereof were almost too heavy for the strongest person.His people said to him: \"Do not glee, for God does not love the gleeful","28:77":"And seek with the provisions bestowed upon you by God the abode of the Hereafter, and do not forget your share in this world, and do good as God has done good to you. And do not seek corruption in the land. God does not love the corrupters","28:78":"He said: \"I have attained all this only because of my own knowledge.\" Did he not realize that God had annihilated before him generations that were much stronger than he, and greater in riches? The transgressors were not asked about their crimes","28:79":"Then he came out among his people draped in his ornaments. Those who preferred this worldly life said: \"Oh, if only we were given similar to what Qaroon has been given. Indeed, he is very fortunate","28:80":"And those who were blessed with knowledge said: \"Woe to you! The reward from God is far better for those who believe and do good work. And none attains it except the steadfast","28:81":"We then caused the earth to swallow him and his mansion. He had no group that could protect him against God; nor would he be victorious","28:82":"And those who wished they were in his place the day before said: \"Indeed it is God Who provides or restricts for whoever He chooses from among His servants. Had it not been for the grace of God towards us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us as well. We now realize that the rejecters never succeed","28:83":"Such will be the abode of the Hereafter; We reserve it for those who do not seek prestige on the earth, nor corruption; and the ending will be for the righteous","28:84":"Whoever brings forth a good deed, he will receive a better reward than it. And whoever brings forth a sin then the retribution for their sins will be to the extent of their deeds","28:85":"Surely, the One who decreed the Qur'an to you will summon you to a predetermined appointment. Say: \"My Lord is fully aware of who it is that brings the guidance, and who has gone astray","28:86":"Nor did you expect this Book to come your way; but this is a mercy from your Lord. Therefore, you shall not side with the rejecters","28:87":"Nor shall you be diverted from the revelations of God after they have come to you. And invite to your Lord. And do not be of the polytheists","28:88":"And do not call besides God any god, there is no god except He. Everything will fade away except His face. To Him is the judgment, and to Him you will be returned","29:1":"ALM","29:2":"Did the people think that they will be left to say: \"We believe\" without being put to the test","29:3":"We had tested those before them, so that God would distinguish those who are truthful and so that He would know the liars","29:4":"Or did those who sinned think that they would be ahead of Us? Miserable indeed is their judgment","29:5":"Whoever looks forward to meeting God, then the meeting of God will come. And He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable","29:6":"And whoever strives is only striving for himself; for God is in no need of the worlds","29:7":"And those who believed and did good works, We will cancel their sins and We will reward them in the best for what they did","29:8":"And We instructed man to be good to his parents. But if they strive to make you set up partners with Me, then do not obey them. To Me are all your destinies, and I will inform you of what you used to do","29:9":"And those who believed and did good works, We will admit them with the righteous","29:10":"And from among the people are those who say: \"We believe in God,\" but if he is harmed in the sake of God, he equates the persecution inflicted by the people with the punishment of God! And if a victory comes from your Lord, he says: \"We were with you!\" Is God not fully aware of what is in the chests of the worlds","29:11":"God is fully aware of those who believed, and He is fully aware of the hypocrites","29:12":"And those who rejected said to those who believed: \"Follow our path and we will carry your mistakes.\" But they cannot carry anything from their mistakes, they are liars","29:13":"And they will carry their own burdens, and burdens with their burdens, and they will be asked on the Day of Resurrection regarding what they fabricated","29:14":"And We had sent Noah to his people, so he stayed with them one thousand years less fifty. Then the flood took them while they were wicked","29:15":"So We saved him and the people on the ship, and We made it a sign for the worlds","29:16":"And Abraham when he said to his people: \"Serve God and be aware of Him, that is better for you if only you knew","29:17":"You are worshipping nothing except idols besides Him, and you are creating fabrications. Those that you worship besides God do not possess for you any provision, so seek with God the provision and serve Him and be thankful to Him; to Him you will return","29:18":"And if you disbelieve, then nations before you have also disbelieved.\" The messenger is only required to deliver clearly","29:19":"Did they not observe how God initiates the creation then He returns it? All that for God is easy to do","29:20":"Say: \"Roam the earth and observe how the creation was initiated. Thus God will establish the final creation. God is capable of all things","29:21":"God will punish whom He wills and He will have mercy on whom He wills, and to Him you will return","29:22":"And you will not be able to escape this fact, on the earth or in the heavens, nor do you have besides God any ally or victor","29:23":"And those who rejected the revelations of God and in meeting Him; those have forsaken My mercy; and they will have a painful retribution","29:24":"But the only response from his people was their saying: \"Kill him, or burn him.\" But God saved him from the fire. In this are signs for a people who believe","29:25":"And he said: \"You have taken idols besides God in order to preserve some friendship among you in this worldly life. But then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will reject one another, and curse one another. Your destiny is Hell, and you will have no victors","29:26":"Lot believed with him and said: \"I am emigrating to my Lord. He is the Noble, the Wise","29:27":"And We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and We made within his progeny the prophethood and the Book. And We gave him his reward in this world, and in the Hereafter he is among the righteous","29:28":"And Lot, when he said to his people: \"You commit an immorality that no others in the world have done before","29:29":"You sexually approach men, and you commit highway robbery, and you bring all vice to your society.\" But the only response from his people was to say: \"Bring us the retribution of God, if you are being truthful","29:30":"He said: \"My Lord, grant me victory over the wicked people","29:31":"And when Our messengers came to Abraham with good news, they said: \"We are to destroy the people of such a town, for its people have been wicked","29:32":"He said: \"But Lot is in it!\" They said: \"We are fully aware of who is in it. We will save him and his family, except his wife; she is of those doomed","29:33":"And when Our messengers came to Lot, they were mistreated, and he was embarrassed towards them. And they said: \"Do not fear, and do not be saddened. We will save you and your family, except for your wife; she is of those doomed","29:34":"We will send down upon the people of this town an affliction from the heaven for what wickedness they were in","29:35":"And We left remains of it as a clear sign for a people who comprehend","29:36":"And to Midyan was their brother Shu'ayb. He said: \"O my people, serve God and seek the Last Day, and do not roam the earth corrupting","29:37":"But they denied him, so the earthquake took them; thus they became lifeless in their dwelling","29:38":"And 'Aad and Thamud. Much was made apparent to you from their dwellings. The devil had adorned their works in their eyes, thus he diverted them from the path, even though they could see","29:39":"And Qaroon, and Pharaoh, and Haamaan;Moses went to them with clear proofs. But they became arrogant in the land, and they were not the first","29:40":"We took each by his sins. Some of them We sent upon him violent winds, some of them were taken by the scream, some of them We caused the earth to swallow, and some of them We drowned. God is not the One who wronged them; it is they who wronged themselves","29:41":"The example of those who take allies besides God is like the spider how it makes a home; and the weakest home is the home of the spider, if only they knew","29:42":"God knows that what they are calling on besides Him is nothing. He is the Noble, the Wise","29:43":"Such are the examples We put forth for the people, but none comprehend except the knowledgeable","29:44":"God created the heavens and the earth with truth. In that is a sign for the faithful","29:45":"Recite what is inspired to you of the Bookand hold the contact prayer, for the contact prayer prohibits immorality and vice; but certainly the remembrance of God is the greatest. God knows everything you do","29:46":"And do not argue with the people of the Book except in that which is better; except for those who are wicked among them; and say: \"We believe in what was revealed to us and in what was revealed to you, and our god and your god is the same; to Him we submit","29:47":"And similarly, We have sent down to you the Book. Thus, those whom We have given the Book will believe in it. Also, some of your people will believe in it. The only ones who mock Our revelations are the rejecters","29:48":"You were not reciting any Book before this, nor were you writing one down by your hand. In that case, the doubters would have had reason","29:49":"In fact, it is a clear revelation in the chests of those who have been given knowledge. And it is only the wicked who doubt Our revelations","29:50":"And they said: \"If only signs would come down to him from his Lord!\" Say: \"All signs are with God, and I am but a clear warner","29:51":"Is it not enough for them that We have sent down to you the Book that is being recited to them? In that is a mercy and a reminder for people who believe","29:52":"Say: \"God is enough as a witness between me and you. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth. As for those who believe in falsehood and reject God, they are the losers","29:53":"And they hasten you for the retribution! If it were not for an appointed term, the retribution would have come to them. Itwill come to them suddenly, when they do not expect","29:54":"They hasten you for the retribution; while Hell surrounds the rejecters","29:55":"The Day will come when the retribution overwhelms them, from above them and from beneath their feet; and We will say: \"Taste the results of what you used to do","29:56":"O My servants who believed, My earth is spacious, so serve only Me","29:57":"Every soul will taste death, then to Us you will be returned","29:58":"And those who believe and do good works, We will settle them in mansions in the Paradise, with rivers flowing beneath them, abiding therein.

He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable","29:61":"And if you ask them: \"Who has created the heavens and the earth, and put the sun and the moon in motion?\" They will say: \"God.\" Why then did they deviate","29:62":"God expands the provision for whoever He chooses from among His servants, and withholds it. God is fully aware of all things","29:63":"And if you ask them: \"Who sends down water from the sky, thus reviving the land after its death?\" They will say: \"God.\" Say: \"Praise be to God.\" But most of them do not comprehend","29:64":"And this worldly life is no more than distraction and play, while the abode of the Hereafter is the reality, if only they knew","29:65":"When they ride on a ship, they call on God,devoting the system to Him. But as soon as He saves them to the shore, they set up partners","29:66":"Let them reject what We have given them, and let them enjoy; for they will come to know","29:67":"Have they not seen that We have established a safe territory, while all around them the people are in constant danger? Would they still believe in falsehood, and reject the blessings of God","29:68":"Who is more evil than he who fabricates lies and attributes them to God, or denies the truth when it comes to him?

They were more powerful than them, and they cultivated the land and they built in it far more than these have built, and their messengers came to them with the proofs. God was not to wrong them, but it was they who wronged themselves","30:10":"Then the end of those who did evil was evil, that is because they denied the signs of God, and they used to mock them","30:11":"God initiates the creation, then He repeats it, then to Him you will return","30:12":"And the Day when the Hour will be established, the criminals will be in despair","30:13":"And they did not have any intercessors from the partners they set up, and they will reject such partners","30:14":"And on the Day the Hour is established, they will be separated","30:15":"So, those who believed and did good works, they will be delighted in a luxurious place","30:16":"And as for those who rejected and denied Our revelations and the meeting of the Hereafter, they shall be brought forth for the retribution","30:17":"So glory be to God, when you retire and when you wake","30:18":"And to Him is all praise in the heavens and the earth, and in the evening and when you go out","30:19":"He brings the living out of the dead, and He brings the dead out of the living.

And similarly you will be brought out","30:20":"And from His signs is that He created you from dust, then you became human beings, spreading out","30:21":"And from His signs is that He created for you mates from yourselves that you may reside with them, and He placed between you affection and mercy. In that are signs for a people who reflect","30:22":"And from His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of your tongues and your colors. In that are signs for the world","30:23":"And from His signs is your sleep by night and day, and your seeking of His bounty.

Would you fear them as you fear each other? It is such that We clarify the revelations for a people who have sense","30:29":"No, those who were wrong followed their desires without knowledge. So who can guide he whom God misguides? And they will have no victors","30:30":"So establish yourself to the system of monotheism. It is the inclination that God has nurtured the people on.

He will make them taste some of what they have done, perhaps they will return","30:42":"Say: \"Roam the earth and see how the end was for those before. Most of them were polytheists","30:43":"So establish yourself to the system which is straight, before a Day comes from God that none can avert. On that Day they shall be separated","30:44":"Whoever rejects, then he will suffer his rejection; and whoever does good works, then it is for themselves that they are preparing a good place","30:45":"So that He will reward those that believe and do good works from His grace. He does not love the rejecters","30:46":"And from His signs is that He sends the winds with glad tidings, and to give you a taste of His mercy, and so that the ships may sail by His command, and that you may seek of His bounty; perhaps you will be thankful","30:47":"And We have sent before you messengers to their people. So they came to them with clear proofs; then We took revenge on those who were criminals. And it is binding upon Us to grant victory to the believers","30:48":"God Who sends the winds, so they raise clouds, and He spreads them in the sky as He wishes, then He turns them into joined pieces, then you see the rain drops come forth from their midst. Then when He makes them fall on whoever He wills of His servants, they rejoice","30:49":"Even though just before He sent it down to them, they were in despair","30:50":"So look at the effects of the mercy of God, how He revives the land after its death.

You shall compensate them, and let them go in an amicable manner","33:50":"O prophet, We have made lawful for you the wives to whom you have already given their dowries, and those who are maintained by your oath, as granted to you by God; and the daughters of the brothers of your father, and the daughters of the sisters of your father, and the daughters of the brothers of your mother, and the daughters of the sisters of your mother - those who emigrated with you. Also, the believing woman who had decreed herself to the prophet, the prophet may marry her if he wishes, as a privilege given only to you and not to the believers.

But if you are invited, you may enter. And when you finish eating, you shall leave, without staying to wait for a narrative. This used to bother the prophet, and he was shy to tell you. But God does not shy away from the truth. And if you ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not for you to harm the messenger of God, nor that you should marry his wives after him. This is indeed a gross offence with God","33:54":"If you reveal anything, or hide it, God is fully aware of all things","33:55":"There is no sin upon them before their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or the sons of their brothers, or the sons of their sisters, or their women, or those who are maintained by their oaths.

So We made them narrations and We tore them into pieces. In this are signs for every person who is patient, thankful","34:20":"And Satan has been successful in his suggestions to them, for they followed him, except for a group of the believers","34:21":"And he did not have any authority over them except that We might distinguish those who believed in the Hereafter from those who are doubtful about it.

And anything you spend, He will replace it; and He is the Best of providers","34:40":"And on the Day when We gather them all, then We will say to the angels: \"Was it you that these people used to serve","34:41":"They will say: \"Be You glorified. You are our Lord, not them. No, most of them were serving the Jinn; most were believers to them","34:42":"So today, none of you can help or harm one another. And We will say to the transgressors: \"Taste the retribution of the Fire that you used to deny","34:43":"And when Our clear revelations were recited to them, they said: \"This is but a man who wants to turn you away from what your parents were worshiping.\" And they also said: \"This is nothing except a fabricated lie.\" And those who disbelieved say of the truth when it has come to them: \"This is nothing except evident magic","34:44":"We had not given to them any books to study, nor did We send to them before you any warner","34:45":"And those before them had also denied, while they did not reach one tenth of what We had given them, but they denied My messengers; so how was My retribution","34:46":"Say: \"I advise you to do one thing: that you stand to God, in twos and individually, then reflect.\" There is no madness in your friend, he is only a warner to you in the face of a severe retribution","34:47":"Say: \"I have not asked you for any wage; for it will be your own. My wage is from God, and He is witness over all things","34:48":"Say: \"My Lord casts with the truth. He is the Knower of all secrets","34:49":"Say: \"The truth has come; while falsehood can neither initiate anything, nor resurrect","34:50":"Say: \"If I stray, then I stray to my own loss. And if I am guided, then it is because of what my Lord inspired to me. He is Hearer, Near","34:51":"And if you could but see, when they will be terrified with no escape, and they will be taken from a place that is near","34:52":"And they will say: \"We believe in it!\" But it will be far too late","34:53":"And they had rejected it in the past; and they made allegations regarding the unseen, from a place far off","34:54":"And a barrier will be set between them and what they had desired, as was done for their counterparts before. They have been in grave doubt","35:1":"Praise be to God, Initiator of the heavens and the earth; maker of the angels as messengers with wings of two, and three, and four. He increases in the creation as He wishes. God is able to do all things","35:2":"Whatever mercy God opens for the people, none can stop it. And what He holds back none can send it other than He. And He is the Noble, the Wise","35:3":"O people, remember the blessings of God upon you. Is there any creator other than God who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? There is no god besides Him, so why do you deviate","35:4":"And if they deny you, then also messengers before you have been denied. And to God all matters are returned","35:5":"O people, the promise of God is the truth; therefore, do not be overwhelmed by this worldly life, and do not let arrogance overwhelm you from God","35:6":"The devil is an enemy to you, so treat him as an enemy. He only invites his faction to be the dwellers of Hell","35:7":"Those who reject will have a painful retribution, and those who believe and do good works they will have a forgiveness and a great reward","35:8":"As for he whose evil work is adorned for him so he sees it as being good; for God thus misguides whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills. So do not let yourself grieve over them. God is fully aware of what they are doing","35:9":"And God is the One who sends the winds so it stirs up a cloud, then We drive it to a land that is dead, and We revive with it the earth after it had died. Such is the resurrection","35:10":"Whoever is seeking dignity, then know that to God belongs all dignity. To Him ascend the good words, and the good deeds raise them up. And as for those who scheme evil, they will have a painful retribution, and their scheming will fail","35:11":"And God created you from dust, then from a seed, then He made you into pairs. And no female becomes pregnant, nor gives birth, without His knowledge. Nor does anyone have his life extended, or his life is shortened, except in a record. This is easy for God","35:12":"Nor are the two seas the same. One is fresh and palatable, good to drink, while the other is salty and bitter. And from each of them you eat tender meat, and you extract jewelry to wear. And you see the ships sailing through them, seeking His provisions; and perhaps you may be thankful","35:13":"He merges the night into the day, and He merges the day into the night. And He has commissioned the sun and the moon, each running for an appointed term. Such is God your Lord; to Him is the sovereignty. And as for those whom you pray to besides Him, they do not possess even the shell of a seed","35:14":"If you pray to them, they cannot hear you. And even if they hear you, they cannot respond to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will reject your partnership. And none can inform you like an Expert","35:15":"O people, you are the poor when it comes to God, while God is the Rich, the Praiseworthy","35:16":"If He wishes, He could do away with you and He would bring a new creation","35:17":"And this is not difficult for God","35:18":"And none can carry the load of another; and even if it calls on another to bear part of its load, no other can carry any part of it, even if they were related. You will only be able to warn those who are concerned towards their Lord while unseen, and they hold the contact prayer. And whoever contributes, is contributing for himself. And to God is the final destiny","35:19":"The blind and the seer are not equal","35:20":"Nor are the darkness and the light","35:21":"Nor are the shade and the heat","35:22":"Nor equal are the living and the dead; God causes whoever He wills to hear; and you cannot make those who are in the graves hear","35:23":"You are but a warner","35:24":"We have sent you with the truth as a bearer of good news and a warner. There was not a nation that a warner did not come to it","35:25":"And if they deny you, then those before them have also denied. Their messengers went to them with the proofs and the scriptures and the Book of Enlightenment","35:26":"Then I seized those who rejected; so how was My retribution","35:27":"Do you not see that God sends down water from the sky, thus We produce with it fruits of various colors? And of the mountains are peaks that are white, red, or some other color and intense black","35:28":"And from the people, and the animals, and the livestock, are various colors. Those concerned with God from among His servants are the most knowledgeable. God is Noble, Forgiving","35:29":"Surely, those who recite the Book of God and hold the contact prayer, and spend secretly and openly from what We have provided them, they are seeking a trade that can never lose","35:30":"He will give them their recompense, and He will increase them from His blessings. He is Forgiving, Thankful","35:31":"And what We inspired to you from the Book, it is the truth, authenticating what is between his hands. God is Expert over His servants, Seer","35:32":"Then We inherited the Book to those whom We selected from Our servants. Subsequently, some of them wronged themselves, and others upheld it partly, while others were eager to work righteousness in accordance with the will of God; such is the great benefit","35:33":"They will enter gardens of delight, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments in it will be of silk","35:34":"And they will say: \"Praise be to God who took away our sorrow. Our Lord is Forgiving, Thankful","35:35":"The One who admitted us into the abode of eternal bliss, out of His grace. In it, no boredom touches us, nor does any fatigue","35:36":"As for those who have rejected, for them is the fire of Hell, where they do not terminate and die, nor is its retribution ever reduced for them. It is such that We requite every rejecter","35:37":"And they will scream in it: \"Our Lord, let us out, and we will work righteousness instead of the works we used to do.\" Did We not give you a long life so that he who would remember would take heed, and a warner came to you? Therefore, taste, for the transgressors will have no supporter","35:38":"God knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth. He is knowledgeable of what is even in the chests","35:39":"He is the One who made you successors on the earth. So, whoever rejects, then to him is his rejection. And the rejection of the rejecters only increases the abhorrence of their Lord towards them. The rejection of the rejecters only increases their loss","35:40":"Say: \"Do you see the partners whom you have called on besides God? Show me what they have created on the earth. Or do they possess any partnership in the heavens? Or have We given them a book wherein they are taking knowledge from it? Indeed, what the transgressors promise one another is no more than arrogance","35:41":"God is the One who holds the heavens and the earth, lest they cease to exist. And they would certainly cease to exist if anyone else were to hold them after Him. He is Compassionate, Forgiving","35:42":"And they swore by God in their strongest oaths, that if a warner came to them, they would be the most guided of all nations, but when a warner came to them, it only increased their aversion","35:43":"Arrogance on the earth, and evil scheming. And the evil schemes only backfire on those who scheme them. Were they expecting anything different from the ways used on the people of the past? You will not find any change in the way of God, and you will not find any bypass to the way of God","35:44":"Did they not roam the earth and note how was the consequence for those who were before them? And they were even more powerful than they in strength. But nothing can inhibit God be it in the heavens, or the earth. He is Knowledgeable, Omnipotent","35:45":"And if God were to punish the people for what they have earned, He would not leave a single creature standing. But He delays them to an appointed term. So, when their time comes, then God is Seer of His servants","36:1":"YS","36:2":"And the Qur'an of wisdom","36:3":"You are one of the messengers","36:4":"Upon a straight path","36:5":"The revelation of the Most Honorable, the Merciful","36:6":"To warn a people whose fathers were not warned, for they are unaware","36:7":"The retribution has been deserved by most of them, for they do not believe","36:8":"We have placed shackles around their necks, up to their chins, so that they are forced in place","36:9":"And We have placed a barrier in front of them, and a barrier behind them, thus We shielded them so they cannot see","36:10":"And whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe","36:11":"You can only warn him who follows the Reminder, and is concerned towards the Almighty while unseen. Give him good news of forgiveness and a generous reward","36:12":"It is indeed Us who resurrect the dead, and We record what they have done and left behind. And everything We have counted in a clear ledger","36:13":"And put forth for them the example of the people of the town, when the messengers came to it","36:14":"Where We sent two to them, but they disbelieved in them, so We supported them with a third one, thus they said: \"We are messengers to you","36:15":"They said: \"You are but human beings like us, and the Almighty did not send down anything, you are only telling lies","36:16":"They said: \"Our Lord knows that we have been sent to you","36:17":"And we are only required to give a clear delivery","36:18":"They said: \"We have welcomed you better than you deserve. If you do not cease, we will stone you, and you will receive a painful retribution from us","36:19":"They said: \"Keep your welcome with you, for you have been reminded. Indeed, you are transgressing people","36:20":"And a man came running from the farthest part of the city, saying: \"O my people, follow the messengers","36:21":"Follow those who do not ask you for any wage, and are guided","36:22":"And why should I not serve the One who initiated me, and to Him is your ultimate return","36:23":"Shall I take gods besides Him? If the Almighty intends any harm for me, their intercession cannot help me in the least, nor can they save me","36:24":"Then I would be clearly astray","36:25":"I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me","36:26":"It was said: \"Enter the Paradise.\" He said \"Oh, how I wish if only my people knew","36:27":"Of what my Lord has forgiven me, and made me of the honored ones","36:28":"And We did not send down upon his people after him soldiers from the heaven; for there was no need to send them down","36:29":"For all it took was one scream, whereupon they were stilled","36:30":"What sorrow for the servants. For every time a messenger went to them, they would mock him","36:31":"Did they not see how many generations We destroyed before them, do they not go back to them","36:32":"And how every one of them will be summoned before Us","36:33":"And a sign for them is the dead land, We revive it and produce from it seeds from which they eat","36:34":"And We made in it gardens of date palms, and grapes, and We cause springs to gush forth therein","36:35":"So that they may eat from its fruits, and what they manufacture with their own hands. Would they be thankful","36:36":"Praise be to the One who has created all pairs from what the earth sprouts out and from themselves, and from what they do not know","36:37":"And a sign for them is the night, We strip the daylight from it, whereupon they are in darkness","36:38":"And the sun runs to a specific destination, such is the design of the Noble, the Knowledgeable","36:39":"And the moon We have measured it to appear in stages, until it returns like an old palm sheath","36:40":"The sun is not required to overtake the moon, nor will the night precede the day; each of them is swimming in its own orbit","36:41":"And a sign for them is that We carried their ancestors on the charged ship","36:42":"And We created for them of its similarity, to ride in","36:43":"And if We wished, We could drown them, so that their screaming would not be heard, nor could they be saved","36:44":"Except through a mercy from Us, and as an enjoyment for awhile","36:45":"And when they are told: \"Be aware of your present and your past, that you may attain mercy","36:46":"And no matter what sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord, they turn away from it","36:47":"And when they are told: \"Spend from what God has provisioned you.\" Those who reject say to those who believe: \"Shall we feed those whom God could feed, if He so willed? You are clearly misguided","36:48":"And they say: \"When is this promise to come, if you are truthful","36:49":"They will not realize it when one scream overwhelms them, while they dispute","36:50":"They will not even be able to leave a will, nor will they be able to return to their people","36:51":"And the horn will be blown, whereupon they will rise from the graves massing towards their Lord","36:52":"They will say: \"Woe to us! Who has resurrected us from our resting place? This is what the Almighty had promised; and the messengers were truthful","36:53":"It only took one scream, whereupon they are summoned before Us","36:54":"On this Day, no soul will be wronged in the least. You will be recompensed precisely for whatever you did","36:55":"The dwellers of the Paradise will be, on that Day, joyfully busy","36:56":"Both them and their spouses, they will be shaded, reclining on raised couches","36:57":"They will have fruits therein; they will have in it whatever they ask for","36:58":"Saying of: \"Peace\" from a Merciful Lord","36:59":"As for you, O criminals, you are singled out","36:60":"Did I not pledge to you, O Children of Adam, that you should not serve the devil for he is your most ardent enemy","36:61":"And that you should serve Me? That is a straight path","36:62":"He has misled mountain loads of you. Did you not comprehend","36:63":"This is Hell that you have been promised","36:64":"Burn in it today, as a consequence of your rejection","36:65":"Today, We shall cease their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will bear witness to everything they had done","36:66":"And if We wished, We can blind their eyes, and they would race towards the path, but how would they see","36:67":"And if We wished, We can freeze them in their place; thus, they can neither move forward, nor go back","36:68":"And for whoever We grant a long life, We weaken him in body. Do they not comprehend","36:69":"And We did not teach him poetry, nor does he need it. This is a reminder and a clear Qur'an","36:70":"To warn those who are alive, and so that the retribution will be deserved by the rejecters","36:71":"Did they not see that We created for them with Our own hands livestock which they own","36:72":"And they were subdued by Us for them. So some they ride, and some they eat","36:73":"And they have benefits in them, and to drink. Would they not be thankful","36:74":"And they have taken besides God other gods, perhaps they will help them","36:75":"They cannot help them; while they are soldiers for them","36:76":"So do not be saddened by what they say. We are fullyaware of what they conceal and what they declare","36:77":"Has man not seen that We have created him from a seed, but he then becomes a clear opponent","36:78":"And he puts forth an example for Us, while forgetting his own creation! He says: \"Who can resurrect the bones while they are dust","36:79":"Say: \"The One who has made them in the first place will resurrect them. He is fully aware of every creation","36:80":"The One who initiated for you a forest fire, by which you learned to light","36:81":"Is not the One who has created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them? Yes indeed; He is the Creator, the Knowledgeable","36:82":"His command, when He wants anything, is to say to it: 'Be,' and it is","36:83":"Therefore, praise be to the One in whose Hand is the sovereignty of all things, and to Him you will be returned","37:1":"By the columns in formation","37:2":"By the drivers of clouds","37:3":"By the remembrance which follows","37:4":"Your god is indeed One","37:5":"The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and what lies between them, and the Lord of the sunrises","37:6":"We have adorned the lower heaven with the decoration of planets","37:7":"And to guard against every rebellious devil","37:8":"They cannot listen to the command up high; and they are bombarded from every side","37:9":"Outcasts; they will have an eternal retribution","37:10":"Any of them who snatches a part, he is pursued by a piercing flame","37:11":"So ask them: \"Are they the more powerful creation, or the others We created?\" We have created them from a clay that is sticky","37:12":"While you were awed, they simply mocked","37:13":"And when they are reminded, they do not care","37:14":"And when they see a sign, they make fun of it","37:15":"And they said: \"This is nothing except evident magic","37:16":"Can it be that after we die and become dust and bones, that we are resurrected","37:17":"What about our fathers of old","37:18":"Say: \"Yes, and you will be humbled","37:19":"All it takes is one sound, then they will be staring","37:20":"And they said: \"Woe to us, this is the Day of Recompense","37:21":"This is the Day of decisiveness that you used to deny","37:22":"Gather the transgressors, and their mates, and all they worshiped","37:23":"Beside God, and guide them to the path of Hell","37:24":"And let them stand and be questioned","37:25":"Why do you not support one another","37:26":"No, for today they have totally given up","37:27":"And some of them came to each other, questioning","37:28":"They said: \"You used to entice us from the right side","37:29":"They replied: \"No, it was you who were not believers","37:30":"And we never had any power over you, but you were a wicked people","37:31":"So the decree of our Lord is now upon us, that we will suffer","37:32":"We misled you, because we were astray","37:33":"Then, on that Day they will all share in the retribution","37:34":"This is how We deal with the criminals","37:35":"When it was said to them: \"There is no god except God,\" they would be arrogant","37:36":"And they would say: \"Shall we leave our gods because of a crazy poet","37:37":"No, he has come with the truth and he has confirmed the messengers","37:38":"You will taste the greatest of retribution","37:39":"And you are only recompensed for what you have done","37:40":"Except for the servants God who are faithful","37:41":"For them will be known provisions","37:42":"Fruits, and they will be honored","37:43":"In gardens of bliss","37:44":"On beds which are opposite one another","37:45":"They will be served with a cup of pure drink","37:46":"White, delicious for the drinkers","37:47":"There is no bitterness therein, nor will they tire from it","37:48":"And with them are those with a modest gaze, with lovely eyes","37:49":"They are like fragile eggs","37:50":"So then they approached one another, questioning","37:51":"One of them said: \"I used to have a friend","37:52":"Who used to say: 'Are you among those who believe in this","37:53":"That if we die and turn into dust and bones, that we would be called to account","37:54":"He said: \"Can anyone find him","37:55":"So when he looked, he saw him in the midst of Hell","37:56":"He said: \"By God, you nearly ruined me","37:57":"And had it not been for the blessing of my Lord, I would have been with you","37:58":"Are we then not going to die","37:59":"Except for our first death, and we will not be punished","37:60":"Such is the great triumph","37:61":"For this let those who will work endeavor","37:62":"Is that a better destination, or the tree of Bitterness","37:63":"We have made it a punishment for the transgressors","37:64":"It is a tree that grows in the midst of Hell","37:65":"Its shoots are like the devils' heads","37:66":"They will eat from it, so that their bellies are filled up","37:67":"Then they will have with it a drink of boiling liquid","37:68":"Then they will be returned to Hell","37:69":"They had found their parents astray","37:70":"So they too have hastened in their footsteps","37:71":"Most of the previous generations have strayed before them","37:72":"And We had sent to them warners","37:73":"Thus note the consequences for those who were warned","37:74":"Except for the servants of God who are faithful","37:75":"And Noah had called upon Us, for We are the best to respond","37:76":"And We saved him and his family from the great disaster","37:77":"And We made his progeny the one that remained","37:78":"And We kept his history for those who came later","37:79":"Peace be upon Noah among the worlds","37:80":"It is such that We reward the righteous","37:81":"He is of Our believing servants","37:82":"Then We drowned the others","37:83":"And from his clan was Abraham","37:84":"For he came to his Lord with a pure heart","37:85":"When he said to his father and his people: \"What are you worshiping","37:86":"Is it fabricated gods, instead of God, that you want","37:87":"What do you say of the Lord of the worlds","37:88":"Then he looked towards the stars","37:89":"And he said: \"I am ill","37:90":"So they turned away from him and departed","37:91":"He then went to their gods and said: \"Can you not eat","37:92":"What is the matter, you do not speak","37:93":"So he then turned on them, striking with his hand","37:94":"Then they approached him outraged","37:95":"He said: \"Do you worship what you carve","37:96":"While God has created you, and all that you make","37:97":"They said: \"Build for him a structure, and then cast him into its fire","37:98":"So they wanted to plan against him, but We made them the losers","37:99":"And he said: \"I am going to my Lord; He will guide me","37:100":"My Lord, grant me from among the righteous","37:101":"So We gave him good news of a compassionate child","37:102":"And when he grew enough to work with him, he said: \"My son, I am seeing in a dream that I am sacrificing you. What do you think?\" He said: \"O my father, do what you are commanded to do. You will find me, God willing, patient","37:103":"So when they both had submitted, and he was laid by his forehead","37:104":"And We called him: \"O Abraham","37:105":"You have carried out the vision.\" It was such that We rewarded the righteous","37:106":"Surely, this was an exacting test","37:107":"And We ransomed him with a great animal sacrifice","37:108":"And We kept his history for those who came later","37:109":"Peace be upon Abraham","37:110":"It is thus that We reward the righteous","37:111":"He was of Our believing servants","37:112":"And We gave him the good news of the coming of Isaac, a prophet from among the righteous","37:113":"And We blessed him and Isaac. And from among their progeny, some are righteous, and some are clearly wicked","37:114":"And indeed, We have given Our grace to Moses and Aaron","37:115":"And We saved them and their people from the great disaster","37:116":"And We supported them, so that they became the winners","37:117":"And We gave both the clear Book","37:118":"And We guided them to the straight path","37:119":"And We kept their history for those who came later","37:120":"Peace be upon Moses and Aaron","37:121":"We thus reward the righteous","37:122":"Both of them were among Our believing servants","37:123":"And Elias was one of the messengers","37:124":"When he said to his people: \"Would you not be righteous","37:125":"Would you call on Ba'al and forsake the best Creator","37:126":"God is your Lord, and the Lord of your fathers of old","37:127":"But they denied him. Thus they were called to account","37:128":"Except for the devoted servants of God","37:129":"And We kept his history for those who came later","37:130":"Peace be upon the family of Elias","37:131":"We thus reward the righteous","37:132":"He was one of our believing servants","37:133":"And Lot was one of the messengers","37:134":"When We saved him and all his family","37:135":"Except an old woman who remained","37:136":"Then, We destroyed the rest","37:137":"And you pass by them in the morning","37:138":"And in the night.

God thus seals the hearts of every arrogant tyrant","40:36":"And Pharaoh said: \"O Haamaan, build for me a high platform that I may uncover the secrets","40:37":"The secrets of the heavens, so that I may take a look at the god of Moses; though I think he is a liar.\" Thus the evil works of Pharaoh were adorned for him, and he was blocked from the path. And the planning of Pharaoh brought nothing but regret","40:38":"And the one who believed said: \"O my people, follow me, and I will guide you to the right path","40:39":"O my people, this worldly life is but an enjoyment, while the Hereafter is the permanent abode","40:40":"Whoever does a sin, will not be requited except for its equivalent, and whoever does good, whether male or female, and is a believer, then those will be admitted to the Paradise, where they will receive provision without reckoning","40:41":"And, O my people, why is it that I invite you to salvation, while you invite me to the Fire","40:42":"You invite me to reject God, and set up partners besides Him that I have no knowledge of, and I am inviting you to the Noble, the Forgiver","40:43":"There is no doubt that what you invite me to has no basis in this world, nor in the Hereafter. And our ultimate return will be to God, and that the transgressors will be the dwellers of the Fire","40:44":"You will come to remember what I am telling you, and I leave my affair in this matter to God; for God is the Seer of the servants","40:45":"So God protected him from the evil of what they schemed, while the people of Pharaoh have incurred the worst retribution","40:46":"The Fire, which they will be exposed to morning and evening, and on the Day when the Hour is established: \"Admit the people of Pharaoh into the most severe of the retribution","40:47":"And when they argue in Hell, the weak will say to those who were arrogant: \"We used to be your followers, can you take from us any portion of the Fire","40:48":"Those who were arrogant will say: \"We are all in it together, for God has passed judgment upon the servants","40:49":"And those who are in the Fire will say to the guardians of Hell: \"Call upon your Lord to reduce for us the retribution, by just one day","40:50":"They will say: \"Did your messengers not come to you with proofs?\" They will say: \"Yes.\" They will say: \"Then implore, but the imploring of the rejecters will be nothing but in vain","40:51":"We will indeed grant victory to Our messengers and to those who believed in the worldly life, and on the Day when the witnesses will rise","40:52":"A Day when excuses will be of no help to the transgressors, and they will be cursed, and they will have the worst abode","40:53":"And We gave Moses the guidance, and We made the Children of Israel inherit the Book","40:54":"A guide and a reminder for those who possess intelligence","40:55":"So be patient, for the promise of God is true, and seek forgiveness for your sin, and glorify and praise your Lord evening and morning","40:56":"Surely, those who dispute about the revelations of God without any authority given to them, there is nothing except arrogance in their chests, which they do not perceive. Therefore, seek refuge with God; He is the Hearer, the Seer","40:57":"The creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of the people, but most of the people do not know","40:58":"And not equal are the blind and the seer, nor those who believe and do good works, and those who do evil. Little do you remember","40:59":"Surely the Hour is coming, there is no doubt in it, but most of the people do not believe","40:60":"And your Lord said: \"Call on Me and I will respond to you.\" Surely, those who are too arrogant to serve Me, they will enter Hell, humbled","40:61":"God, it is He Who has made for you the night to reside in and the day to see in. Surely, God provides many blessings upon the people, but most of the people are not thankful","40:62":"That is God, your Lord, Creator of all things. There is no god except He, so why do you deviate","40:63":"Thus, those who were denying the revelations of God were deviated","40:64":"God is the One who made the earth a habitat for you, and the heaven as a structure, and He designed you, and has perfected your design. And He provided you with good provisions. Such is God your Lord. Most Exalted is God, Lord of the worlds","40:65":"He is the Living; there is no god except He. So call on Him while devoting the system to Him. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds","40:66":"Say: \"I have been prohibited from serving those whom you are calling upon besides God, since the proofs have come to me from my Lord. And I have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds","40:67":"He is the One who has created you from dust, then from a seed, then from an embryo, then He brings you out as a child, then He lets you reach your maturity, then you become old; and some of you will have their lives terminated before this; and that you may reach an appointed term, and perhaps so you may comprehend","40:68":"He is the One who gives life and death. And when He decides upon anything, He simply says to it: 'Be,' and it is","40:69":"Did you not see those who dispute about the revelations of God, how they have deviated","40:70":"Those who deny the Book, and what We have sent Our messengers with. Therefore, they will come to know","40:71":"When the shackles will be around their necks and in chains they will be dragged off","40:72":"To the boiling water, then in the Fire they will be burned","40:73":"Then it will be said to them: \"Where are those that you have set up as partners","40:74":"Beside God?\" They will say: \"They have abandoned us. No, we did not used to call on anything before!\" Thus God leads the rejecters astray","40:75":"That was because you used to gloat on the earth without any right, and for what you used to rejoice","40:76":"Enter the gates of Hell, abiding therein. What a miserable abode for the arrogant ones","40:77":"So be patient, for the promise of God is true. So, if We show you some of what We promise them, or We terminate your life, then it is to Us that they will be returned","40:78":"And We have sent messengers prior to you. Some of them We have told to you, and some We did not tell to you. And it was not given to any messenger that he should bring a sign except with the permission of God. So, when the judgment of God is issued, the matter is decided with the truth, and the followers of falsehood will be lost","40:79":"God is the One who made the livestock for you that you may ride on some of them, and some of them you eat","40:80":"And you have other benefits in them. And that you may reach by them what is desired in your chests. And on them and on the ships, you are carried","40:81":"And He shows you His signs. So which of the signs of God do you deny","40:82":"Have they not roamed the earth and noted the consequences for those who were before them? They used to be greater in number than them and mightier in strength, and they had built more in the land. Yet, all that they had earned could not avail them","40:83":"Then, when their messengers came to them with clear proofs, they were content with what they already had of knowledge. And they will be surrounded by that which they used to mock","40:84":"So when they saw Our might, they said: \"We believe in God alone, and we reject all the partners we used to set up","40:85":"But their belief could not help them once they saw Our might; such is the way of God that has been established for His servants; and the rejecters were then totally in loss","41:1":"HM","41:2":"A revelation from the Almighty, the Merciful","41:3":"A Book whose verses are made detailed - an Arabic revelation for a people who know","41:4":"A bearer of good news, and a warner. But most of them turn away; they do not hear","41:5":"And they said: \"Our hearts are sealed from what you invite us to, and in our ears is a deafness, and there is a barrier between us and you. So do what you will, and so will we","41:6":"Say: \"I am no more than a human being like you. It is inspired to me that your god is One god, therefore you shall be upright towards Him and seek His forgiveness. And woe to the polytheists","41:7":"The ones who do not contribute towards purification, and with regards to the Hereafter, they are disbelievers","41:8":"Surely, those who believe and do good works, they will receive recompense that will not end","41:9":"Say: \"You are rejecting the One who has created the earth in two days, and you set up equals with Him. That is the Lord of the worlds","41:10":"And He placed in it stabilizers from above it, and He blessed it and established its provisions in proportion in four days, to satisfy those who ask","41:11":"Then He settled to the heaven, while it was still smoke, and He said to it, and to the earth: \"Come willingly or unwillingly.\" They said: \"We come willingly","41:12":"Thus, He then made them into seven heavens in two days, and He inspired to every heaven its affair. And We adorned the lowest heaven with lamps, and for protection. Such is the design of the Noble, the Knowledgeable","41:13":"But if they turn away, then say: \"I have warned you of a destruction like the destruction of 'Aad and Thamud","41:14":"When the messengers came to them, publicly and privately: \"You shall not serve except God.\" They said: \"Had our Lord willed, He would have sent angels. We are rejecting what you have been sent with","41:15":"As for 'Aad, they turned arrogant on the earth, without any right, and they said: \"Who is mightier than us in strength?\" Did they not see that God, who has created them, was mightier than they in strength? And they were denying Our revelations","41:16":"Consequently, We sent upon them a violent wind, for a few miserable days, that We may let them taste the humiliating retribution in this worldly life, and the retribution of the Hereafter is more humiliating; they can never win","41:17":"And as for Thamud, We gave them the guidance, but they preferred blindness over guidance. Consequently, the blast of humiliating retribution annihilated them, because of what they earned","41:18":"And We saved those who believed and were righteous","41:19":"And the Day when the enemies of God will be gathered to the Fire, forcibly","41:20":"When they come to it, their own hearing, eyes, and skins will bear witness to everything they had done","41:21":"And they will say to their skins: \"Why did you bear witness against us?\" They will say: \"God made us speak; He is the One who causes everything to speak. He is the One who has created you the first time, and to Him you return","41:22":"And there was no way you could hide from the testimony of your own hearing, or your eyes, or your skins. In fact, you thought that God was unaware of much of what you do","41:23":"And this is the kind of thinking about your Lord that has caused you to fail, and thus you became of the losers","41:24":"If they wait, then the Fire will be their destiny, and if they beg to be excused, they will not be excused","41:25":"And We assigned to them associates who adorned their present and past actions. Thus, the retribution has been deserved by them the same as previous nations of Jinn and mankind; all of them were losers","41:26":"And those who rejected said: \"Do not listen to this Qur'an and make noise over it that you may succeed","41:27":"We will let those who have rejected taste a severe retribution. And We will recompense them for the evil that they used to do","41:28":"Such is the recompense for the enemies of God. The Fire shall be their eternal abode, as a recompense for their discarding Our revelations","41:29":"And those who have rejected will say: \"Our Lord, show us those who have misled us from among the Jinn and mankind so we can trample them under our feet, so that they would be the lowest","41:30":"Those who have said: \"Our Lord is God,\" then they did right, the angels will come down upon them: \"You shall not fear, nor shall you grieve. Rejoice in the good news of the Paradise that you have been promised","41:31":"We are your allies in this worldly life and in the Hereafter.In it you will have anything your soul desires, and in it you will have anything you ask for","41:32":"A dwelling, from a Forgiver, Merciful","41:33":"And who is better in saying than he who invites to God, and does good works, and says: \"I am one of those who have submitted","41:34":"Not equal are the good and the bad response. You shall resort to the one which is better. Thus, the one who used to be your enemy, may become your best friend","41:35":"And none can attain this except those who are patient. And none can attain this except those who are extremely fortunate","41:36":"And if bitterness from the devil afflicts you, then seek refuge with God. He is the Hearer, the Knowledgeable","41:37":"And from among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun, nor the moon; you shall prostrate to God who has created them, if it is truly Him you serve","41:38":"So, if they become arrogant, then those who are with your Lord glorify Him night and day, and they never despair","41:39":"And from among His signs is that you see the land still, then, as soon as We send down the water upon it, it shakes and grows. Surely, the One who revived it can revive the dead. He is capable of all things","41:40":"Those who distort Our revelations are not hidden from Us. Is one who is thrown into Hell better, or one who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection? Do whatever you wish; He is Seer of what you do","41:41":"Those who have rejected the Reminder when it came to them; and it is an Honorable Book","41:42":"No falsehood could enter it, presently or afterwards; a revelation from One Most Wise, Praiseworthy","41:43":"What is being said to you is the same that was said to the messengers before you. Your Lord has forgiveness, and He has a painful retribution","41:44":"And had We made it a non-Arabic revelation, they would have said: \"If only its verses were made clear!\" Non-Arabic and Arabic, say: \"For those who believe, it is a guide and healing. As for those who disbelieve, there is deafness in their ears, and they are blind to it. These will be called from a place far away","41:45":"And We have given Moses the Book, but it was disputed in. And had it not been for the predetermined decision of your Lord, they would have been judged immediately. Indeed, they harbor many doubts about it","41:46":"Whoever does good works does so for his own soul, and whoever works evil shall have the same. Your Lord does not wrong the servants","41:47":"To Him belongs the knowledge regarding the Hour. And no fruit emerges from its sheath, nor does any female conceive or give birth, except by His knowledge. And on the Day He asks them: \"Where are My partners?\" They will say: \"With your permission, none of us will bear witness to such","41:48":"And they were abandoned by that which they used to call on before, and they realized that there will be no escape","41:49":"Man does not tire in praying for good things. But if adversity touches him, he is disheartened, desperate","41:50":"And when We let him taste a mercy from Us after hardship had touched him, he will say: \"This was by my actions, and I do not think that the Hour will come to pass. And even if I am returned to my Lord, I will find at Him good things for me.\" Surely, We will inform the rejecters of all they had done, and We will let them taste the severe retribution","41:51":"And when We bless man, he withdraws and turns away, and when he suffers any adversity, then he implores at length","41:52":"Say: \"Do you see if this was from God and then you rejected it? Who is further astray than those who are in opposition","41:53":"We will show them Our signs in the horizons, and within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that this is the truth.

Surely, God is the Forgiver, the Merciful","42:6":"And those who take allies besides Him, God is responsible for them; and you are not a guardian over them","42:7":"And thus We have inspired to you an Arabic revelation, so that you may warn the capital town and all around it, and to warn about the Day of Gathering that is inevitable. A group will be in the Paradise, and a group in Hell","42:8":"And if God had willed, He could have made them one nation. But He admits whom He wills into His mercy. And the transgressors will have neither an ally, nor helper","42:9":"Or have they taken allies besides Him? But God is the ally, and He is the One who resurrects the dead, and He is able to do all things","42:10":"And anything you dispute in, then its judgment shall be with God. Such is God my Lord. In Him I place my trust, and to Him I repent","42:11":"Initiator of the heavens and the earth. He created for you from among yourselves mates, and also mates for the livestock so they may multiply. There is nothing that equals Him. He is the Hearer, the Seer","42:12":"To Him belong the possessions of the heavens and the earth. He spreads out the provision for whoever He wills, and He measures it. He is fully aware of all things","42:13":"He has decreed for you the same system He ordained for Noah, and what We inspired to you, and what We ordained for Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: \"You shall uphold this system, and do not divide in it.\" Intolerable for the polytheists is what you invite them towards. God chooses for Himself whoever He wills; He guides to Himself those who repent","42:14":"And they only divided after the knowledge had come to them, due to resentment among themselves. And had it not been for a predetermined decision from your Lord, they would have been judged immediately. Indeed, those who inherited the Book after them are full of doubts","42:15":"For that, you shall preach and be upright, as you have been commanded, and do not follow their wishes. And say: \"I believe in all that God has sent down as a Book, and I was commanded to be with justice between you. God is our Lord and your Lord. We have our deeds and you have your deeds. There is no argument between us and you. God will gather us all together, and to Him is the ultimate destiny","42:16":"And those who debate about God, after they had been answered, their argument is nullified at their Lord. They have incurred a wrath, and will have a severe retribution","42:17":"God is the One who sent down the Book with the truth, and the balance. And for all that you know, the Hour may be very near","42:18":"Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it, while those who believe are concerned about it, and they know that it is the truth. Certainly, those who dispute the Hour have gone far astray","42:19":"God is Gracious to His servants; He gives provisions for whoever He wills, and He is the Powerful, the Noble","42:20":"Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter, We will increase for him his harvest. And whoever seeks the harvest of this world, We will give him therefrom, and he will have no share in the Hereafter","42:21":"Or do they have partners who decree for them a system which has not been authorized by God? And if it were not for the word already given, they would have been judged immediately. Indeed, the transgressors will have a painful retribution","42:22":"You see the transgressors worried because of what they had done; and it will come back at them. As for those who believed and do good works, they will be in gardens of bliss. They will have what they wish from their Lord. This is the great blessing","42:23":"Such is the good news from God to His servants who believe and do good works. Say: \"I do not ask you for any wage, except that you show compassion to your relatives.\" And whoever earns a good deed, We shall increase it for him in goodness. Surely, God is Forgiving, Thankful","42:24":"Or do they say: \"He has fabricated lies about God!\" Had God willed, He could have sealed your heart. And God erases the falsehood and affirms the truth with His words. He is fully aware of what is in the chests","42:25":"And He is the One who accepts the repentance from His servants, and He forgives the sins. He is fully aware of what you do","42:26":"And those that believe and do good works respond to Him, and He increases for them His blessings. As for the rejecters, they have incurred a severe retribution","42:27":"And if God were to increase the provision for His servants, they would transgress on the earth; but He sends down what He wills in a measure. He is Expert and Seer of His servants","42:28":"And He is the One who sends down the rain after they had despaired, and spreads His mercy. He is the Supporter, the Praiseworthy","42:29":"And from among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the creatures He spreads in them. And He is able to gather them, if He wills","42:30":"And any misfortune that happens to you is a consequence of what your hands have earned. And He overlooks much","42:31":"And you can never escape, and you have none besides God as an ally or helper","42:32":"And from His signs are the vessels that sail the sea like flags","42:33":"If He willed, He could still the winds, leaving them motionless on top of it. In that are signs for every one who is patient, thankful","42:34":"Or He may drown them, for what they have earned. And He overlooks much","42:35":"And that those who dispute in Our signs may know that they have no place to hide","42:36":"So whatever you are given is simply an enjoyment of the worldly life, and what is with God is far better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord","42:37":"And those who avoid major sins and immorality, and when they are angered, they forgive","42:38":"And those who have responded to their Lord, and they hold the contact prayer, and their affairs are conducted by mutual consultation among themselves, and from Our provisions to them they give","42:39":"And those who, when injustice befalls them, they seek justice","42:40":"The recompense for a crime shall be its equivalence, but whoever forgives and makes right, then his reward is upon God. He does not like the wrongdoers","42:41":"And for any who demand action after being wronged, those are not committing any error","42:42":"The error is upon those who oppress the people, and they aggress in the land without cause. For these will be a painful retribution","42:43":"And for he who is patient and forgives, then that is an indication of strength","42:44":"And whoever God sends astray will not have any ally after Him. And you will see the transgressors, when they see the retribution, saying: \"Is there any way we can go back","42:45":"And you will see them being displayed to it, in fearful humiliation, and looking, while trying to avoid looking. And those who believed will say: \"The losers are those who lost their souls and their families on the Day of Resurrection. The transgressors will be in a lasting retribution","42:46":"And they had no allies to help them against God. And whoever Godmisguides will never find the way","42:47":"Respond to your Lord before a Day comes from God which cannot be averted. You will have no refuge for you on that Day, nor an advocate","42:48":"But if they turn away, then We did not send you as their guardian. You are only required to deliver. And when We let man taste a mercy from Us, he becomes happy with it; and when adversity afflicts them for what their hands have delivered, then man becomes rejecting","42:49":"To God is the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He creates whatever He wills. He bestows daughters to whoever He wills, and bestows sons to whoever He wills","42:50":"Or, He may bestow them with both sons and daughters, and He makes whom He wills barren. He is Knowledgeable, Capable","42:51":"And it is not for any human being that God would speak to him, except through inspiration, or from behind a barrier, or by sending a messenger to inspire whom He wills with His permission. He is Most High, Wise","42:52":"And thus, We inspired to you a revelation of Our command. You did not know what was the Book, nor what was faith. Yet, We made this a light to guide whoever We wish from among Our servants. Surely, you guide to a straight path","42:53":"The path of God, to whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth. Ultimately, to God all matters return","43:1":"HM","43:2":"And the clarifying Book","43:3":"We have made it an Arabic revelation, perhaps you may comprehend","43:4":"And it is held honorable and wise in the master record with Us","43:5":"Shall We turn away the Reminder from you, because you are a transgressing people","43:6":"And how many a prophet did We send to the previous generations","43:7":"And every time a prophet went to them, they mocked him","43:8":"We have destroyed those who were even more powerful than these, and the example of the previous generations has already been given","43:9":"And if you asked them: \"Who has created the heavens and the earth?\" They will say: \"They were created by the One who is the Noble, the Knowledgeable","43:10":"He is the One who made the earth a habitat for you, and He made paths in it that you may be guided","43:11":"And He is the One who sends down water from the sky, in exact measure. We then revive with it a dead land. Similarly, you will be brought-out","43:12":"And He is the One who has created all the pairs, and He made for you of the ships and the livestock that which you can ride","43:13":"So that you may settle on their backs; then recall the blessing of your Lord once you have settled on them, and say: \"Glory to the One who has committed this for us, and we could not have done so by ourselves","43:14":"And we will ultimately return to our Lord","43:15":"And they assigned a share to Him from His own servants! Man is clearly denying","43:16":"Or has He selected daughters from among His creation, while He has left you with the sons","43:17":"And if one of them is given news of that which he puts forth as an example for the Almighty, his face becomes dark, and he is miserable","43:18":"What good is an offspring that is brought up to be beautiful, and cannot help in a fight","43:19":"And they have claimed the angels who are with the Almighty are females! Have they been made witness to their creation? We will record their testimony, and they will be asked","43:20":"And they said: \"If the Almighty had willed, we would not have worshipped them.\" They have no knowledge of this; they only conjecture","43:21":"Or have We given them a book before this which they are upholding","43:22":"The fact is, they have said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way, and we are following in their footsteps","43:23":"And similarly, We did not send a warner to a town, except its carefree ones said: \"We found our fathers following a certain way, and we are being guided in their footsteps","43:24":"He said: \"What if I brought to you better a guidance than what you found your fathers upon?\" They said: \"We are disbelievers in that with which you have been sent","43:25":"Consequently, We took revenge upon them. So see how was the consequences of the deniers","43:26":"And when Abraham said to his father and his people: \"I am innocent of that which you worship","43:27":"Except for the One who initiated me, He will guide me","43:28":"And he made it a word to last in his subsequent generations; perhaps they may turn back","43:29":"Indeed, I have given these people and their fathers to enjoy, until the truth came to them, and a clarifying messenger","43:30":"And when the truth came to them, they said: \"This is magic, and we reject it","43:31":"And they said: \"If only this Qur'an was sent down to a man of greatness from the two towns","43:32":"Is it they who assign the mercy of your Lord?

The mercy from your Lord is far better than that which they amass","43:33":"And were it not that all the people would become one nation, We would have provided for those who reject the Almighty silver roofs for their homes, and stairs upon which they could ascend","43:34":"And for their homes, gates, and beds on which they could recline","43:35":"And many ornaments. All these are the pleasures of this worldly life.

We thus requite the criminal people","46:26":"And We had established them in the same way as We established you, and provided them with hearing, and eyesight, and hearts. But their hearing, eyesight, and hearts did not help them at all.

God thus puts forth for the people their examples","47:4":"Therefore, if you encounter those who have rejected, then strike the necks; until you bind them, then secure the cords. You may then either set them free or ransom them, until the war ends. That, and if God had willed, He alone could have beaten them, but He thus tests you by one another.

God destroyed them; and for the rejecters in a similar fate","47:11":"This is because God is the Master for those who believe, while the rejecters have no master","47:12":"God admits those who believe and do good works to gardens with rivers flowing beneath them. As for those who reject, they are enjoying and eating as the livestock eat, and the Fire will be their abode","47:13":"And many a town was stronger than your own town, which drove you out. We destroyed them, and there was none who could help them","47:14":"Is he who is based on proof from his Lord, as he for whom his evil works have been adorned for him and they followed their desires","47:15":"Is the example of the Paradise; that the righteous have been promised with rivers of pure water, and rivers of milk whose taste does not change, and rivers of alcohol that are delicious for the drinkers, and rivers of strained honey, and for them in it are all kinds of fruits, and a forgiveness from their Lord; like that of those who abide in the Fire, and are given to drink boiling water that cuts-up their intestines","47:16":"And some of them listen to you, until when they go out from you, they say to those who have been given the knowledge: \"What did he say?\" Those are the ones whom God has sealed their hearts, and they followed their desires","47:17":"And those who are guided, He increases their guidance, and grants them their righteousness","47:18":"So are they waiting until the Hour comes to them suddenly? For its conditions have already been met. But once it comes to them, how will they benefit from their message","47:19":"So know that there is no god besides God, and ask forgiveness of your sins and also for the believing males and the believing females. And God knows your movements and your place of rest","47:20":"And those who believe say: \"If only a chapter is sent down!\" But when a lawgiving chapter is sent down, and fighting is mentioned in it, you see those who have a disease in their hearts look at you, as if death had already come to them. It thus revealed them","47:21":"Obedience and to speak righteousness until the matter is decided, then if they trust God it would be better for them","47:22":"So do you plan that when you turn away, that you will corrupt the land and sever your family ties","47:23":"These are the ones whom God has cursed and thus He made them deaf and blinded their sight","47:24":"Do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? Or are there locks on the hearts","47:25":"Surely, those who returned back, after the guidance has been made clear to them, the devil has enticed them and has led them on","47:26":"That is because they said to those who hated what God had sent down: \"We will obey you in certain matters.\" And God knows their secrets","47:27":"So how will it be when their lives are terminated by the angels, while striking their faces and their backs","47:28":"That is because they followed that which angered God, and they hated that which pleased Him. Thus, He nullified their works","47:29":"Or did those who harbor a disease in their hearts think that God would not bring out their evil thoughts","47:30":"And if We wished, We would show them to you so you would recognize them by their looks. However, you can recognize them by their speech. And God is fully aware of your works","47:31":"And We will test you for We know those who strive among you and those who are patient. And We will bring out your qualities","47:32":"Those who have rejected and repelled from the path of God, and stood against the messenger; after the guidance has been made clear for them; they will not harm God in the least, and He will nullify their works","47:33":"O you who believe, obey God, and obey the messenger. And do not render your works in vain","47:34":"Surely, those who rejected and repelled from the path of God, then they died while still rejecting, God will never forgive them","47:35":"Therefore, do not be weak and ask for peace, for you are on a higher moral ground, and God is with you. And He will not waste your efforts","47:36":"The worldly life is no more than play and distraction. But if you believe and lead a righteous life, He will reward you, and He will not ask you for your wealth","47:37":"If He were to ask you for it, to the extent of creating a hardship for you, you would become stingy, and your hidden evil will be exposed","47:38":"Here you are being invited to spend in the cause of God, but some among you turn stingy. And whoever is stingy is only being stingy on himself. And God is the Rich, while you are the poor. And if you turn away, He will substitute another people instead of you, then they will not be like you","48:1":"We have given you a clear conquest","48:2":"So that God may forgive your present sins, and those past, and so that He may complete His blessings upon you, and guide you on a straight path","48:3":"And God will grant you a conquest which is mighty","48:4":"He is the One who sends down tranquility into the hearts of the believers, so that they may increase in faith along with their present faith.

God is Noble, Wise","48:20":"God has promised you abundant spoils that you will take. Thus He has hastened this for you, and He has withheld the hands of the people against you; that it may be a sign for the believers, and that He may guide you to a straight path","48:21":"And the other group which you could not vanquish, God took care of them.

And if anyone fights you, we will support you.\" God bears witness that they are liars","59:12":"If they were driven out, they would not have gone out with them, and if anyone fought them, they would not have supported them. And even if they supported them, they would have turned around and fled. They could never win","59:13":"Indeed, you strike more terror in their hearts than their fear of God. This is because they are people who do not understand","59:14":"They will not fight you all together unless they are in fortified towns, or from behind walls. Their might appears formidable among themselves. You would think that they are united, but their hearts are divided.

Glorifying Him is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Noble, the Wise","60:1":"O you who believe, do not take My enemy and your enemy as allies. You extend love to them, even though they have rejected the truth that has come to you. They drive you and the messenger out, simply because you believe in God, your Lord.

For God loves the equitable","60:9":"But God does prohibit you regarding those who fought you because of your system, and drove you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out. You shall not ally with them. Those who ally with them, then such are the transgressors","60:10":"O you who believe, if the believing females come emigrating to you, then you shall test them. God is fully aware of their belief. Thus, if you establish that they are believers, then you shall not return them to the rejecters. They are no longer lawful for one another. And return the dowries that were paid. And there is no sin upon you to marry them, if you have paid their dowries to them. And do not keep disbelieving wives, and ask back what dowries you paid. And let them ask back what dowries they had paid. Such is the judgment of God; He judges between you. God is Knowledgeable, Wise","60:11":"And if any of your wives have gone-over to the camp of the rejecters, and you are granted victory over them, then you shall compensate those whose wives have gone-over, to the equivalent of what dowry they spent.
