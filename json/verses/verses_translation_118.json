Thus repay we a wicked people","46:26":"With power had we endued them, even as with power have we endued you; and we had given them ears and eyes and hearts: yet neither their eyes, nor their ears, nor their hearts aided them at all, when once they gainsaid the signs of God; but that punishment which they had mocked at enveloped them on all sides","46:27":"Of old, too, did we destroy the cities which were round about you; and, in order that they might return to us, we varied our signs before them","46:28":"But did those whom they took for gods beside God as his kindred deities, help them? Nay, they withdrew from them. Such was their delusion, and their device","46:29":"And remember when we turned aside a company of the djinn to thee, that they might hearken to the Koran: and no sooner were they present at its reading than they said to each other, \"Hist;\" and when it was ended, they returned to their people with warnings","46:30":"They said, \"O our people! verily we have been listening to a book sent down since the days of Moses, affirming the previous scriptures; it guideth to the truth, and to the right way","46:31":"O our people!

Enough! shall any perish save they who transgress","47:1":"WHOSO believe not, and prevent others from the way of God - their works will He cause to miscarry","47:2":"But whoso believe, and do things that are right, and believe in what hath been sent down to MUHAMMAD - for it is the truth from their Lord - their sins will He cancel, and dispose their hearts aright","47:3":"This - because the infidels followed vanity, while those who believe, followed the truth from their Lord. Thus to men doth God set forth their likenesses","47:4":"When ye encounter the infidels, strike off their heads till ye have made a great slaughter among them, and of the rest make fast the fetters. And afterwards let there either be free dismissals or ransomings, till the war hath laid down its burdens. Thus do.

We destroyed them, and there was none to help them","47:14":"Shall he who followeth the clear teaching of his Lord be as he, the evil of whose doings hath been made to seem good to him, or like those who follow their own lusts","47:15":"A picture of the Paradise which is promised to the God-fearing! Therein are rivers of water, which corrupt not: rivers of milk, whose taste changeth not: and rivers of wine, delicious to those who quaff it; And rivers of honey clarified: and therein are all kinds of fruit for them from their Lord! Is this like the lot of those who must dwell for ever in the fire? and shall have draughts of boiling water forced on them which will rend their bowels asunder","47:16":"Some of them indeed hearken to thee, until when they go out from thee, they say with sneers to those to whom \"the knowledge\" hath been given, \"What is this he said?\" These are they whose hearts God hath sealed up, and who follow their own lusts","47:17":"But as to those who have the guidance, He will increase their guidance, and He will teach them what to fear","47:18":"For what do the infidels wait, but that the Hour come suddenly on them?

But better in them would be obedience and becoming language","47:21":"And if, when the command for war is issued, they are true to God, it will be assuredly best for them","47:22":"Were ye not ready, if ye had turned back from Him, to spread disorder in the land, and violate the ties of blood","47:23":"These are they whom God hath cursed, and made deaf, and blinded their eyes","47:24":"Will they not then meditate on the Koran? Are locks upon their hearts","47:25":"But as to those who return to their errors after \"the guidance\" hath been made plain to them, Satan shall beguile them, and fill them with his suggestions","47:26":"This - because they say to those who abhor what God hath sent down, \"We will comply with you in part of what ye enjoin.\" But God knoweth their secret reservations","47:27":"But how? When the angels, in causing them to die, shall smite them on the face and back","47:28":"This - because they follow that which angereth God, and abhor what pleaseth Him: therefore will He make their works fruitless","47:29":"Think these men of diseased hearts, that God will not bring out their malice to light","47:30":"If such were our pleasure, we could point them out to thee, and thou surely know them by their tokens: and know them thou shalt, by the strangeness of their words. God knoweth your doings","47:31":"And we will surely test you, until we know the valiant and the steadfast among you: and we will test the reports of your conduct","47:32":"Verily they who believe not, and turn others from the way of God, and separate from the Apostle after that \"the guidance\" hath been clearly shewn them, shall in no way injure God: but their works shall he bring to nought","47:33":"Believers! obey God and the Apostle: and render not your works vain","47:34":"Verily those who believe not, and who pervert others from the way of God, and then die in unbelief, God will not forgive","47:35":"Be not fainthearted then; and invite not the infidels to peace when ye have the upper hand: for God is with you, and will not defraud you of the recompense of your works","47:36":"Surely this present life is only a play, and pastime! but if ye believe, fear God; He will give you your rewards: but He will not ask all your riches of you","47:37":"Should He ask them of you, and urge you, ye would shew yourself niggards: and He would bring your grudges to light","47:38":"Lo! ye are they, who are called to expend for the cause of God: and some of you are niggards: but whoso is niggardly shall be niggard only to his own loss; for God is the Rich, and ye are the poor: and if ye turn back, He will change you for another people, and they shall not be your like","48:1":"Verily, We have won for thee an undoubted VICTORY","48:2":"In token that God forgiveth thy earlier and later faults, and fulfilleth His goodness to thee, and guideth thee on the right way","48:3":"And that God succoureth thee with a mighty succour","48:4":"He it is who sendeth down a spirit of secure repose into the hearts of the faithful that they might add faith to their faith; (for God's are the armies of the Heavens and of the Earth: and God is Knowing, Wise)","48:5":"And that He may bring the believing men and the believing women into gardens 'neath whose trees the rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever, and that He may cancel their evil deeds: for this is the great bliss with God","48:6":"And that He may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the men and women who join other gods with God, and think evil thoughts of Him.
