On the other hand, those who have chosen to disbelieve, try to ridicule by saying, \"What could Allah mean to teach by this similitude?\" Thus His Law of guidance lets go astray many and shows the Way to many.

Go back in shame to Egypt and you will get what you demand.\" So humiliation and misery were stamped upon them and they had to face the Divine Requital.

And be mindful of Allah and know that Allah is on the side of those who walk aright","2:195":"(It is impossible for a greedy, stingy, niggardly person to grow in goodness. Greed, stinginess and hoarding harm the individual and the society). Spend your wealth in the Cause of Allah, and let not your own hands throw you into destruction. Rather, be consistent in benefiting your fellow human beings. Behold, Allah loves the benefactors of humanity","2:196":"And complete the Hajj or Umrah for Allah. If it so happens that you planned but could not execute your plan to visit, send in gifts that the congregation would utilize. Do not consider that by doing so you have relieved yourself of the burden of the duty from your head. Be with them at heart until all reach the destination. If someone is sick or has other compelling burdens on the head denying him sending the gifts, then Abstinence for a few days at convenience, or an act of charity or fulfilling someone's need shall be in order. If a person is present in the congregation but cannot afford gift sharing, one should exercise Abstinence for a total number of ten days, three days there and seven days after coming home. This is for him whose folk are not present in the Sacred Masjid (Makkah in the wider sense). This will help him feel no less devoted than others. Follow the Guidance of Allah. Remember the higher goal and be mindful of Allah. And know that Allah's Law of Requital is strict in pursuing and grasping","2:197":"The Pilgrimage shall take place in the months made well known to mankind. Arrange it in a manner that people may get together from around the world and confer. Whoever participates in Pilgrimage shall refrain from intimate husband-wife relationship, misconduct and arguments throughout Hajj so that mutual consultation could take place in an amicable environment. Allah will acknowledge what you accomplish for the good of mankind. And do make provision for the entire number of days so that you don't have to ask people for help, rather be able to help them. But remember that the most important and best provision is your good conduct. Be mindful of Me, O Men and women of understanding","2:198":"Allah is fully Cognizant of your economic needs. And the Pilgrimage is not a gathering of people who have renounced the world. Therefore, there is nothing wrong in seeking Allah's bounty by conducting business. Returning from the field of Arafat, remember Allah at the sacred relic of Muzdalifa. Remember Him as He has guided you, before you were of the straying","2:199":"You have seen that Pilgrimage is not a ritual. It is intended to be a platform for achieving harmony among mankind through interactive dialogue and consultation. When the pilgrimage is over, return to your homes as simple ordinary people without pomp and pride, and stick to the program agreed upon there. Allah, through His Infinite Mercy, will make your efforts fruitful and procure security and protection for mankind through this program, like a helmet protects the head. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","2:200":"When you have returned to your homes after completing the acts of devotion, the greatest change that should come in you is that you live your life according to the Commands of Allah rather than what you were doing before, i.e., following the ways of your forefathers. People, who look for short-term gains in blind following, forfeit the long term Eternal success","2:201":"And among men and women are those who forsake not the Hereafter for this world, and forsake not this life for the Hereafter. They are the ones who insure themselves against Fire. They say, \"Our Lord! Give to us in this world what is good, and in the Hereafter what is good, and guard us from the doom of fire","2:202":"For those who seek good in both lives, is a decent portion they have earned. Allah's Law is swift at reckoning","2:203":"The appointed days of Pilgrimage and Umrah are meant to remind one another of Allah's Commands. If a participant hastens his departure by a couple of days or delays it, there is no detriment in either case for those who walk aright. Walk aright and remember that all of you will be gathered before Him","2:204":"Now there is a kind of man whose views on the life of the world dazzle you, and he even swears by God to what is in his heart. Moreover, he is exceedingly skillful in argument. (But he disregards the Eternal Values and the Hereafter)","2:205":"If such people attain political power they create corruption in the earth. Their rule results in destruction of the produce of land and labor and the damage done by them affects generations.

Hell will settle his account, a miserable abode","2:207":"But there is also a kind of man who would willingly sell his \"Self\" for Allah's Approval.

Come, all of you, into submission to Him. Enter the System of Islam fully and collectively. Do not follow the footsteps of the Satan, your rebellious desire. Selfish desire that rebels against the Divine Values is your most ardent enemy. (Desire or emotion leads our actions while the intellect rationalizes them. Only the Divine Values given in the Qur'an can empower our higher control of the intellect)","2:209":"(There will be attempts at beclouding the Profound Message of the Qur'an as happened in the case of earlier Scriptures. Certain man-made books will be created and promoted as if they were equivalent to or superseded the Qur'an).

And then He would decree all matters. Nay! All matters of guidance have been expounded in this Book. Allah is Omnipresent and all actions return to Allah for judgment","2:211":"O Messenger! Ask the Children of Israel how many clear Revelations We gave them. Whoever alters the blessed Message of Allah after it has come to him must know that Allah's Requital is Strong in grasping","2:212":"Beautified seems the life of this world to the rejecters, and they ridicule the believers who uphold Permanent Values and look beyond instant gains. Those who live an upright life will be higher in degrees on the Day of Resurrection. Allah provides without stint to His creation according to His Law that does not discriminate between people. He is the Sustainer of all humanity","2:213":"Mankind were one community. (Nature's provision was abundant and open for all (2:36). Then Satan, their selfish desire, divided them (10:19)) Allah sent Prophets as heralds of good news and as Warners. He sent down with them the Scripture with the Truth to judge among people in their differences. After the Prophet passed on, people started differing in the Scripture that was given to them with clear verses. And they did so in stubborn rivalry. Allah by His Will keeps the sincere believers guided in Truth concerning whatever differences arise among them. Allah guides people according to His Laws.

They had to go through hardship and adversity such that they were shaken up. (Unity of mankind will not be easy to attain. The differences of race, ethnicity, creed, color, lineage, wealth and nationalism would be the barriers to surmount).

Allah knows and you know not","2:217":"During active warfare, mankind should agree upon one month of peacetime. This would serve as a cooling off period. They ask you about the Sacred Months and fighting therein. Say, \"Fighting in the Sacred Months is a grave offense (2:194). However, repelling from the Path of Allah, rejecting His Command and the sanctity of the Sacred Masjid, and evicting its people, are greater offenses in the Sight of Allah. Persecution is a greater crime than killing.\" They will not cease from fighting against you till they revert you from your religion, if they can. Those among you who revert from their religion, and die as disbelievers, have nullified their works in this life and their rewards in the Hereafter.

Uniformity of Ideology between the husband and the wife is important to ensure a wholesome family life). Do not marry women who associate others with Allah, till they believe. Even if such women seem attractive to you, marrying a believing woman who toils in labor and might not seem as attractive, is better for you. Nor shall you give your daughters in marriage to men who associate others with Allah, till they believe. A believing man is better than an idolater, even if you like him. Clash of basic value systems creates a fiery atmosphere in the family and it carries on to the Lasting Abode. Allah, by His Leave, invites you to Paradise and protection against your imperfections.

There is no waiting period for a woman who is divorced before intimate relations with her husband (33:49). And it is three months if they do not habitually menstruate (65:4). They shall not conceal pregnancy if they believe in Allah and in the Hereafter. In case of pregnancy, their waiting period shall be until delivery (65:4). And during this period their husbands would do better to take them back if both of them desire reconciliation. The husband and the wife have the right to reconcile during this waiting period of the wife. Women have rights similar to those of men in mutual kindness. Men, however, do not have a waiting period for remarriage for obvious physiological reasons. That is where men are on a platform different from them.

She shall be allowed to live in the same home amicably, or leave it amicably. At or after divorce, it is not lawful for you to take back anything of what you have ever given to her. However, if both of you fear that you might (in waves of emotion) transgress the bounds set by Allah, there shall be no blame on either of you if the wife willingly gives back whatever she chooses. These are the Limits set by Allah; transgress them not. Whoever transgresses the bounds set by Allah, such are the wrongdoers","2:230":"If a man divorces his wife on a third different time during their marital life, it shall be unlawful for him to remarry her. It may so happen that the woman marries another man, and those two do not get along, and the other husband divorces her. In that case, there is nothing wrong if both (the previous couple) decide to come together again, if they consider that they will be able to observe the Limits set by Allah. These Limits have been made clear to enable people to make use of the Divine gift of knowledge","2:231":"When you have divorced women, and they have completed their waiting period, then retain them in kindness or release them in kindness. You shall allow them to live in the same home amicably, or let them leave amicably. Do not force them to stay against their will, as revenge. Anyone who does this wrongs his own \"Self\".

No human being shall be burdened with more than he or she is well able to bear. No mother shall be made to suffer because of her child, nor shall a father be made to suffer because of his child. If the father dies, his heir will assume these responsibilities. If both parents decide with mutual consent, there shall be nothing wrong in entrusting your children to foster-mothers.

Allah knows that the community will think about getting them married. But, never make a secret pledge or contract with them. Speak with them honorably and in recognized words. Do not tie the wedding knot nor sign the martial contract until the waiting period has ended. Know that Allah understands human psyche, and that which is in your hearts. Take heed of Him and know that Allah is Forgiving, Clement. He does not wish to impose hardship on you. His Laws protect your society from harm by absolving your imperfections.

If the move for divorce originates purely from you, let her have the whole portion. If you men forgo it, it is closer to righteousness. O People! Never forget kindness among yourselves. This Command is from Allah Whose Law of Requital ever monitors your actions and the motives behind them","2:238":"While describing some important marital Laws, it is reiterated that, your Central Duty remains the guarding of the System in which individuals and families can develop their potentials to the maximum.

That would enable you to thwart aggression from any quarters. You won't then, behave cowardly like those who were thousands in numbers, but when challenged by the enemy, they ran in droves leaving their homes behind. They feared death. Then they realized that the Divine Law of mortality is inescapable, hence the fear of death is vain. Soon, they stood up on their feet and defeated the enemy. They lived again.

The Divine Order in the society pays you handsome dividends. Add to this, the tremendous Reward in the Hereafter. The wealth of nations and individuals is not exempt from the Laws of Allah. Every step of the way you are returning to Him","2:246":"Sustained commitment to the Divine Order with your lives and wealth is no easy undertaking. After the times of Moses, some leaders of the Israelites promised their Prophet (Samuel), \"If you appoint a king for us, we will fight in the Cause of Allah.\" The Prophet said, \"Is it your intention to refrain from fighting if it was decreed to you?\" They said' \"Why should we not fight in the Cause of Allah when we have been driven out of our homes with our children?\" Yet when fighting was ordained for them, they turned away all but a few. Allah is Aware of the wrongdoers","2:247":"Their Prophet said, \"Allah has appointed Talut (Saul) as your king.\" They objected, \"How can he have kingship over us when we are more worthy of kingship than he; he is not even rich?\" The Prophet said, \"Allah has chosen him over you, and has blessed him with wisdom and stature. Allah bestows His kingship according to His Laws. He is Infinite, Knowing","2:248":"Their Prophet (Samuel) said, \"The sign of his kingdom is that the Ark of the Covenant will be restored to you, reassuring you from your Lord, and the relics left by the house of Moses and the house of Aaron and preserved by natural laws of archaeology.

They came upon a rivulet on their way. Saul, in order to create discipline among his soldiers and to test their resolve commanded them to refrain from drinking that water, save a sip out of the hand. But except for a few they drank it. Their behavior was hardly strange when they crossed the rivulet. They complained, \"This day we cannot cope with Goliath and his armies.\" But those who were resolute and were convinced that they were marching forward in the Cause of Allah, said, \"How often a small force has overwhelmed a big army since it is the Law of Allah that He is with those who are proactively steadfast","2:250":"Thus praying to their Lord in full conviction in the Law of proactive steadfastness, they advanced toward the invading armies of Goliath","2:251":"And, they routed the much bigger force by the Law of Allah, as David, who was one of the officers of Saul, slew the mighty commander, Goliath. Then Allah honored David with a powerful kingdom, along with wisdom and sound judgment, and commissioned him for the special Office of Knowledge. We have decreed that those who spend their youth in righteousness, i.e., benefiting humanity, shall be granted knowledge and wisdom ((12:22), (28:14)). The annihilation of the mighty armies of Goliath bears a historical lesson for mankind that if Balance in Nature were not one of the Laws, tyrants would ransack the earth and its inhabitants unopposed. But, oppression brings revolution and eventually, the oppressed overthrow the oppressors (22:39). Allah is Limitless in His Bounties to the Worlds","2:252":"These are the Verses of Allah that We recite to you in Absolute, Guarded Truth. And (O Muhammad!) You are among Our Messengers","2:253":"(All Messengers were one in Purpose). We have caused some of them to excel others. (They were assigned different strategies suitable to their times, locations and people. So they worked at diverse platforms and) Allah communicated to all of them in various ways. Jesus son of Mary was one of those Messengers to whom We gave clear signs of the Truth and We helped him with the Sacred Revelation. If Allah had created human beings like programmed robots, lacking free will, they wouldn't have differed and wouldn't fight among themselves in matters of belief. But, Allah planned that men and women be endowed with the ability to make choices, and that compulsion in matters of faith would never been ordained (2:256). Allah makes His Laws in the World of Command as He Wills, and then He implements them in the World of Creation (the Universe) and never changes His Laws ((7:54), (17)","2:254":"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Spend of Our Provision on fellow human beings, and for the betterment of the society. Do that before the day comes when no bargaining, friendship or intercession shall be of any avail. Those who reject such sensible admonition, do grave injustice to themselves","2:255":"These directions, tidings and warnings come from Allah, the One True God. There is no god but He, the Living, the Originator of life, the Self-Subsisting Sustainer of all creation. Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him. All that exists in the Highs and the Lows, in the Heavens and the Earth, belongs to Him alone. Who can intercede in His Court, except as a witness of Law? His Knowledge transcends time and space. No one can encompass a trace of His Knowledge but through His Laws. The Throne of His Supreme Control extends over the Highs and the Lows. No fatigue touches Him as He benevolently guards His Dominion and creation. He is the Glorious, the Supreme","2:256":"(Although this Message has been sent down by the Almighty), there is absolutely no compulsion or coercion in religion. This Rule shall have no exception because Right has been made distinct from Wrong (3:4). Whoever rejects false gods such as the priesthood, and attains conviction in the Word of Allah, has grasped the Unbreakable Support. This assurance comes from Allah, the Hearer the Knower","2:257":"Allah becomes the Guarding Friend of those who, after due reflection, have chosen to believe in His Word (12:108). He brings them out of darkness into Light (through the Qur'an). Those who deny the Divine System of Life, have devilish human \"authorities\" as patrons to lead them from Light into darkness. Such people have chosen Fire to be their eternal companion","2:258":"Think of the one who adamantly argued with Abraham about his Lord because Allah had given him power (Nimrod Shaddad, the King of Babylon who used to proclaim divinity). Abraham said to him, \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death.\" He answered, \"I give life and cause death.\" (Being a tyrant king he could reverse or impose death penalty upon his subjects). Abraham said, \"Allah makes the sun rise from the East; make it rise from the West.\" Thereupon the rejecter of the Truth remained dumbfounded. And Allah does not guide people who displace reality with falsehood","2:259":"The similitude of this history is that someone passes by the ruins of a town and wonders if that town could ever come back to life again, and Allah causes him to die for a hundred years and then revives him. He thinks it was only a matter of a day or a part of it. He even finds his food, drink, and donkey standing beside him. Allah creates you in the wombs of your mothers, in bone and flesh. And when the matter became clear to him, he said, \"I know now that Allah is Able to do all things","2:260":"Abraham wanted to understand the Law of Revival of nations. Allah asked him if he believed that it were possible. Abraham said he believed but that he wanted a practical example to educate his heart and mind.

(At one call of Abraham, those birds came flying back to him. This is how mankind can be brought to the Word of Allah with decent training, giving them a new life). Know that this Wisdom comes to you from Allah, the Almighty, the Wise","2:261":"(In training their peoples, all Messengers of Allah advised them that) spending their wealth in the Cause of Allah is like sowing a seed that brings numerous shoots; each shoot with a hundred grains. This is how Allah's Law of Requital rewards men and women.

Therefore they do not afflict them with reminders of their generosity ((17:26), (30:38)). Their reward is with their Lord. (The society will return their generosity in this life as well). There will be no fear for them from without, nor grief will touch them from within","2:263":"Kind words and respecting people's honor is better than charity coupled with injury. Allah, the Rich, the Clement, provides everyone without return or obligation","2:264":"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Cancel not your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injuring the self-respect of the recipients; like those who spend their wealth for show-off. This kind of behavior contradicts the true belief in Allah and His Law of Recompense. Charity has been ordained to help individuals and not to hurt them (93:10), and Allah has promised you manifold reward. But, a seed won't grow on a dusty rock, upon which rain falls and washes it clean. Even Allah won't guide those who deny such simple realities","2:265":"On the other hand, there are people who keep their wealth open for the society in sincere submission to Allah, not for show off, and not for putting anyone under obligation. They have joined hands with Allah in Purpose and have strengthened their \"Self\" (13:33). They have achieved self-actualization and made themselves truly worthy of immortality (20:76). Remember, that a \"Self\" that has not been developed by giving to community in wealth or labor, merely survives ((14:17), (43:77), (69:27)). Immortality is not a spontaneous gift from Allah; men and women are candidates for it (91:9-10). Such people are creating the Paradise of their own making that is ever-blooming; rain or shine.

Any charity you give will be repaid to you, without the least injustice","2:273":"And give to the needy who are suffering in the Cause of Allah and cannot emigrate and those who are unable to go about the earth in search of livelihood. One, who is unaware of their condition, might think they are free from want, because they abstain from begging. But you can recognize them by the marks on their faces because they do not ask people insistently. Whatever good thing you spend on them, Allah is Aware of it","2:274":"Those who spend their wealth on the needy, by night and by day, secretly or publicly, have their reward with their Sustainer. They shall have nothing to fear or regret","2:275":"On the other hand are those who eat usury. In greed of money, they run around like someone who has been bitten by a snake. They claim that trade is like usury. This is not so. Trade is the return on labor that is permissible (53:39), while usury is the return on money. That is why Allah, in His Infinite Wisdom, has permitted trade and forbidden usury. One to whom the clear Admonition has come from his Sustainer, must abstain from taking usury forthwith. What he has taken in the past, he may keep and his judgment rests with Allah. (It is better for him to return the interest he has earned if possible, but the law shall not force him to do so). As for him who returns to usury, such are the rightful companions of the Fire to abide therein. (Satan=Serpent)","2:276":"Allah blights usury and blesses charitable deeds with prosperity. Allah does not love those who defy His Laws and drag down the potential of the human society. (Mankind will eventually realize that the interest based economic system will have to be replaced with an equitable System. Allah's Laws of Economic Dynamics erase usury and nurture welfare)","2:277":"Those who believe in Allah's Laws, do works beneficial to the society, strive to establish the Divine Order and the Equitable Economic System of Zakat, have their reward with their Lord. They will have nothing to fear and no reason to be despondent.

Be mindful of the Divine Laws and give up what remains of your demand for usury, if you are really believers","2:279":"And if you do it not, then know that you are at war with Allah and His Messenger. But, if you mend your ways, simply take back your capital sums. Inflict not injustice and you will not incur injustice","2:280":"If a debtor is in difficult circumstances, let there be postponement to a time of ease. And if you give up the loan entirely as charity, it is better for you if you did but know","2:281":"And be mindful of the Day when you will be returned to Allah and every \"Self\" will be paid what it has earned, and they will not be wronged","2:282":"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! When you transact a loan for any period, you shall write it down. An impartial scribe shall do the writing. No scribe shall decline to perform this duty, and write as Allah has taught him. The debtor, or in case he or she is incompetent, his representative shall dictate the document honestly and be mindful of his Lord, and diminish not the amount. There shall be two men among you to witness the transaction. If two men are not available, let there be one man and two women as witnesses. All witnesses should be such that their testimony is acceptable to all. The second woman will not be a witness in the court of law. She is there only to remind the first woman if she forgets. It is the obligation of the witnesses to testify when called upon to do so. Do not tire of writing the details, no matter how long, including the time of repayment. This is equitable in the Sight of Allah, assures better witnessing, and eliminates any doubts you may have. When it is actual merchandise that you transfer among yourselves from hand to hand, there is nothing wrong for you if you write it not, but have it witnessed. The scribe and the witnesses must be held harmless for their services. If you harm them, it would be wickedness on your part. If you follow Allah's Commands He will increase you in knowledge. These are the Injunctions of Allah Who is the Knower of all things; intentions, events and actions","2:283":"If you are traveling and a scribe is not available, a collateral of some value may serve the purpose, or a bond shall be posted to guarantee repayment. If one is trusted in this manner, he shall return the collateral or the bond when due, and be mindful of Allah, his Lord. Do not withhold any testimony by concealing what you have witnessed. Anyone who withholds a testimony is noxious to his own sensitivity. Allah is Aware of all your actions","2:284":"To Allah belong all things in the heavens and all things in the earth. Whether you reveal or conceal your intentions and actions, Allah will bring you to account for them. He has appointed Laws of forgiveness and retribution. Allah has Power over all things and events and He has appointed due measure for everything","2:285":"The Messenger has full Conviction in what is revealed unto him from his Lord and so do the believers. Each one has full conviction in Allah, His angels, His Scriptures and His Messengers. They say, \"We make no distinction between any of His Messengers\" (since they were one in Purpose). And they say, \"We hear and we obey, so grant us the protection of forgiveness, our Lord. We journey through life on Your Way","2:286":"Allah tasks not and expects not from anyone more than his capacity. Any challenges that come your way, afford you a chance to expand your \"Self\".

Do not place a burden on us as you did place on those before us. Our Lord! Impose not on us what we have not the strength to bear!

There is no god but He. He is the Almighty, the Wise. (He uses his Power with wisdom and His Rule is the Rule of Law)","3:7":"(The Book He has sent down bears an important Principle.) He it is Who has revealed to you (O Prophet) the Scripture. In it some verses are Literal, while some verses are Allegorical. The verses that pertain to Permanent Values have been presented literally. These verses, MUHKAMAT, are the Essence of the Divine Law. On the other hand, abstract phenomena, historical events, and the World of the Unseen are described in similes, metaphors and allegories for your understanding (MUTASHABIHAT). But those who are given to crookedness in their hearts pursue the allegories and try to give them literal meanings, thus creating dissension. None knows their final meaning (of such as the Essence of God, His Throne, His Book of Decree, the Eternity) but Allah. Those who are well founded in knowledge understand why the allegories have been used and they keep drawing lessons from them (74:31). They proclaim the belief that the entire Book is from their Lord. As the human knowledge evolves, many of the other allegories will unfold their literal meaning (41:53). But only the men and women of understanding will bear this fact in mind. (Each of the verses in the Qur'an is MUHKAM, Absolute Truth and you can understand which ones are to be taken literally and which ones are to be taken allegorically, by the context (11:1), (47:20).

They will be fuel for the Fire","3:11":"Like Pharaoh's people and the ones before them, these people reject Our Revelations, and so Allah will seize them for their trailing behind in humanity.

One was fighting in the Cause of Allah, the other denying Him. With their own eyes the two armies saw each other as twice their number. (The believers in their motivation saw the manifold enemy just twice their own numbers, while the deniers saw the smaller opponents twice the size they actually were). But Allah strengthens people with His support according to His Laws. (Allah helps those who help themselves). This must be a lesson for people of vision for all times","3:14":"Beautiful for mankind is love of the joys that come from women and children, and heaps of gold and silver, and branded horses, and cattle and well-tilled land. That is comfort of the life of the world. Allah! With Him is a more excellent abode.

When they are invited to uphold this Book of Allah, to judge their disputes and apply it in their lives, a party among them declines and turns away","3:24":"This is because they say that the Fire will not touch them but only for a few days.

For such there is an awful doom since they cause divisions instead of unity","3:106":"On the Day, the faces of those who convey the Word of Allah clearly, will be lit up by the Light, and the faces of those who becloud the Light with their sectarian beliefs, shall be portraits of gloom. This is because choosing a sect in DEEN is tantamount to disbelief. So taste a befitting chastisement for your disbelief","3:107":"Those whose faces lit up shall dwell in the Grace of Allah, eternally","3:108":"The Rules given in these Revelations determine the Rise and Fall of nations. This is the Rock Solid Truth. Allah has revealed these Rules because He Wills no injustice in the Worlds, and Wills not that the humans get caught off guard","3:109":"Unto Allah belong all things in the Highs and all things in the Lows. You can see that His Laws govern the heavens and the earth. All things are moving and evolving towards what they are meant to be and all things go back to Allah as their Source","3:110":"Since you have been empowered by the Qur'an, you are the best suited Community that has been raised up for the good of mankind. It is your duty to enjoin the Right and forbid the Wrong, since you accept the Final Word of God as the Criterion (3:4). The Qur'an clearly educates you on the Permanent Moral Value System and decrees authoritatively what the otherwise vague terms of 'right' and 'wrong', and 'good' and 'evil' might mean. Now if the People of the Scripture had attained this kind of belief, it would have been for their own good. But only few among them are believers, while most of them are drifting away from the Truth","3:111":"If you truly become worthy of the title of \"The Best Suited Community\" your opponents would scarcely do a trifling harm and if they come to battle against you, they would flee quickly and find no help","3:112":"Humiliated are they wherever they may be, unless they grasp a bond with God, and a bond with the people. They have incurred displeasure of God, and are committed to disgrace. This is because they have been rejecting the Divine Revelations and have been opposing the Messengers of God, even wrongfully killing some of them. All this, because they rebelled, and persisted in transgressing the bounds of what is right","3:113":"Not all the People of the Scripture are alike. Among them are those who take a firm stand for the right cause, reflect upon the Revelations of Allah by night and fall in full submission","3:114":"They believe in Allah as the One True God, and in the Last Day. They advocate what Allah has decreed as virtuous, and forbid what Allah has decreed as vice. They try to lead in acts of social benefit; such are the ones who augment the human potential","3:115":"No benevolent actions of this kind shall go un-rewarded. Allah knows those who walk aright","3:116":"The wealth and children of the deniers will not avail them against Allah. They will end up in Hellfire to abide therein. (The punishment to humans is built in, in their actions. Allah is not like human tyrants who punish out of anger or displeasure (3:182), (4:111), (20:15), (7:)","3:117":"The likeness of what they spend in this life of the world is the likeness of a biting, frosty wind that destroys the harvest of a people who wronged their own \"Self\". Allah wronged them not, but they wronged themselves. (They spent their wealth on themselves although it was a trust given to them to share with fellow human beings)","3:118":"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Do not take as intimates others than your own folk. They will do all they can to harm you. They love to see you in distress. Many of them have already voiced their hatred and what they hide in their chests is far worse. We thus clarify Our Commands for you so that you use your intellect","3:119":"You endear them though they endear you not. You believe in all the Scriptures. When they meet you they say, \" We believe as you believe\"; but as soon as they leave, they bite their fingers out of rage towards you. Say, \"Die in your rage.\" Allah is fully Aware of what is hidden in your hearts","3:120":"If something good happens to you, it grieves them but if a calamity befalls you, they rejoice at it. Remain steadfast and keep walking aright, and no amount of their plotting or cunning will harm you. Allah's Law Surrounds all that they do","3:121":"(O Messenger) Recall, on the day of the Battle of Uhud, you left your household early to station the believers to their positions. Allah is Hearer, Knower of all that transpires","3:122":"Two groups among you fell short of steadfastness, and your men suffered a temporary setback. And Allah was their Protecting Friend. In Allah believers put their trust","3:123":"Recall the year before. At Badr, Allah granted you clear victory although you were few and under-equipped. (Your resolve and steadfastness had made the difference). Be mindful of Allah so that you are grateful in word and action","3:124":"You told the believers, \"Is it not enough that your Lord supports you with three thousand angels, sent down?\" Fearlessness, determination and courage are the angels Allah sends down upon those who strive in the Cause of Allah (8:1)","3:125":"Indeed if you steadfastly persevere and be mindful of Allah's Laws, and then the enemy attacks you suddenly, your Lord will support you with five thousand angels sweeping on","3:126":"Allah gave the tiding allegorically only as a message of good cheer for you, and that your hearts might be at rest. Courage and steadfastness are Allah's angels. There is no victory contrary to the Laws of Allah, the Almighty Wise","3:127":"He annihilated some disbelievers, or neutralized them and that they end up as the losers","3:128":"It is not your concern (O Messenger), whether He forgives them or punishes them, for they are wrongdoers","3:129":"Everything in the Universe and everything in the earth belongs to Allah. His Law of Requital deals with forgiveness and punishment in all fairness. The Forgiving, the Merciful Allah has designed His Laws","3:130":"(The battle was about protection from the external threat. Your prime duty remains to preserve a benevolent society, to which usury is a big detriment). Usury is the return on money while trade is the return on labor (2:275). O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Do not eat up other people's money by way of usury that appears to you ever-increasing. But Allah's Law blights usury and flourishes acts of caring (2:276). Walk aright in the Way of Allah to attain true prosperity","3:131":"And guard yourselves and the society against the Fire that has been prepared for the rejecters of the Divine Commandments","3:132":"Follow the System of Allah that the Messenger has established. That is how you will achieve the development of your \"Self\". A benevolent society helps you to grow like a mother's womb nourishes the embryo","3:133":"Move forward to the tranquil security that comes from your Lord when you follow His Guidance, and to the Paradise that transcends spatial boundaries, and it has been prepared for those who are mindful of Allah's Laws","3:134":"The candidates to this Paradise keep their wealth open for mankind in favorable as well as in adverse circumstances. They divert and sublimate their anger and potentially virulent emotions to creative energy, and become a source of tranquility and comfort to people. They pardon people gracefully. Allah loves the benefactors of humanity","3:135":"Such men and women quickly correct any wrong or indecency that has occurred from them, they remember Allah, and protect themselves from trailing behind in dignity. And who can absolve imperfections but Allah? They refrain from willfully persisting in error","3:136":"Since they have worked sincerely, their reward is with their Lord in the form of magnificent Gardens with rivulets flowing underneath, wherein they will abide forever, a bountiful reward for sincere workers","3:137":"Systems have passed away before you. (Man-made systems before you, and now before your eyes, are there to reflect upon). Do but travel in the land and see the outcome of nations that rejected the Divine Laws","3:138":"This Qur'an is a declaration to the entire humankind, a Beacon of Guidance and Admonition for those who wish to journey through life in blissful honor and security","3:139":"Do not ever lose heart, and grieve not, for you are bound to prevail if you are truly believers","3:140":"If you suffer hardship, the enemy also suffers hardship. Such days of varying fortunes are governed by Universal Laws. Allah thus distinguishes the true believers, and blesses some of you with martyrdom. They have become witnesses to the power of Truth with their lives. Allah does not love those who displace courage with fear","3:141":"The true believers emerge stronger from every challenge. On the other hand, the rejecters of Divine Laws wither away","3:142":"Do you expect to enter Paradise without Allah distinguishing those among you who strive, and without distinguishing those who are steadfast","3:143":"You used to long for death in the Cause of Allah before you faced it. Now you have faced it, right before your eyes. You understand that honorable life in this world belongs to those who have conquered the fear of death, and that death is the gateway to the Eternal life","3:144":"Muhammad is but a Messenger. All Messengers before him have passed on. If he died or were slain, would you turn back on your heels? The System he has established is here to stay and to become a Beacon of Light for all humanity. If anyone turns away, he would not harm Allah. Allah will soon reward the appreciative. They will reap the fruit of the Benevolent System and then in the Hereafter","3:145":"Allah's Law governs life and death. No one dies except by Allah's leave and at a term appointed per His Laws. Whoever seeks only the vanities of this world, We give him thereof, and whoever seeks the rewards of the Hereafter, We bless him thereof. The Qur'an shows you the Way to success in both worlds (24:55), (28:77). We will soon reward the appreciative","3:146":"Many Prophets have fought in the Cause of Allah and with them a great many men of God, without wavering under adversity, nor did they hesitate nor became discouraged. Allah loves the steadfast","3:147":"They only said, \"Our Lord! Protect us from trailing behind, forgive our excesses, make our foothold sure, and give us victory over the rejecters of Truth","3:148":"Allah gave them excellent reward in this world and in the Hereafter. Allah loves the benefactors of humanity","3:149":"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief!

(2:38)) And causes fear in the hearts of those who are bent upon denying the Truth since they ascribe divine powers besides Allah. People and idols would have no authority against the Laws of Allah. Fire is their abode, a miserable resting place for the wrongdoers","3:152":"Allah made good His promise to you when you routed them by His leave. But then you wavered, disputed among yourselves, and disobeyed after He had shown you the victory you wanted. You were winning the battle of Uhud, but then some of you were distracted by the spoils of the world, while others were concerned with the Hereafter. You disengaged from the enemy and were tested according to His Law. When you mended, Allah pardoned you. Allah is full of Grace for the true believers","3:153":"You were climbing up the hill without looking around and the Messenger was calling you. You suffered according to Allah's Law of Requital. Grieve not about the loss and hardship you have suffered. Allah's Law has adequate provision to nullify the effects of your misgivings. Allah is Informed of all your actions","3:154":"After the setback, He sent down upon you calm that pacified some of you. While another group was anxious with their own feelings and wrong assumptions about Allah due to ignorance. (They were hypocrites worried for their lives). They said, \"Do we have any control?\" Tell them, \"All control belongs to Allah.\" You can control events only within the framework of His Laws. These hypocrites concealed within themselves what they did not reveal to you. They said, \"If we had nothing to do with this battle and had stayed home we would not have been harmed.\" Say, \"Had you stayed in your homes, those destined to be killed would have crawled themselves to the circumstance of death.\" Allah thus lets you test your real convictions. Allah is Aware of what is in the hearts","3:155":"Those of you, who turned back on that day when the two armies clashed, it was their selfish desire which caused them to backslide. This happened because of their imperfections. Allah pardoned them (since their good outweighed their shortcomings). Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing","3:156":"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Do not be like disbelievers who grieve that if their brethren had stayed home with them, rather than going out traveling or defending, they wouldn't have died or been killed. Such attitude creates anguish in the hearts according to Allah's Laws. Fear of death takes away \"life\" out of life. Allah gives life and causes death and Allah is Seer of your behavior","3:157":"If you are slain or die in the defense of the Divine System, you did not give your life in vain. You leave behind a legacy of steadfastness against adversity, and protection for the society. You become worthy of the Grace of Allah that is better than whatever human beings might amass","3:158":"Whether you die or get slain, life goes on to its Destination; you will be gathered before Allah","3:159":"It is a Mercy of Allah that you (O Messenger), are lenient and compassionate with people. If you were harsh and fierce of heart, they would have broken away from you. Pardon their imperfections, arrange their protection and consult with them about the conduct of affairs. Once you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allah. Allah loves those who do their best and then trust in Allah","3:160":"When Allah helps you no one can overcome you. If He withdraws His help from you, who is there who can help you? If you ignore His Laws, His Laws forsake you. Believers put their trust in Allah (since He never changes His Laws)","3:161":"No Prophet could ever act dishonestly. Anyone who acts dishonestly will have to account for it on the Day of Resurrection. That is when every \"Self\" shall receive the recompense and they will not be wronged","3:162":"Is one who seeks the Approval of Allah the same as one who earned Allah's disapproval, and his destiny is Hell, the most miserable abode","3:163":"They are at different levels with Allah. Allah is Seer of what they do. The ranks of all people are determined solely by their deeds, and your Lord is not unaware of anything they do","3:164":"Allah verily has done a great favor to the believers. He has sent a Messenger from amongst them, who conveys and implements the Revelations of Allah. He shows them the way to grow in humanity, and teaches them the Book and Wisdom therein. Before the Messenger came to them, they were in flagrant error","3:165":"Now that you have suffered a setback at Uhud, remember you inflicted twice as much on the enemy at Badr. You say, \"How did this happen?\" Say (O Messenger), \"This is from your own selves.\" (3:152). Allah has appointed due measure for everything","3:166":"If you suffered when the two armies clashed, it happened according to Allah's Laws. He made it a test for the believers to know their strength and weakness","3:167":"And that He might distinguish the hypocrites from the believers. They were told, \"Come fight in the Cause of Allah, or at least defend the city.\" They said, \"If we knew that confrontation were forthcoming, we would have joined you.\" On that day they were closer to disbelief than belief. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts. Allah is best Aware of what they conceal","3:168":"Those who sat back at home said that if their brothers who were fighting in the Cause of Allah, had listened to them they would not have been slain. Say (O Messenger), \"Avert death from yourselves if you are truthful","3:169":"Think not of those, who are slain in the Cause of Allah, as dead. Nay, they are alive! With their Lord they have provision","3:170":"They are jubilant in the bounty that Allah has given them. And rejoicing for those believers whom they have left behind and who have not joined them yet in Bliss. They shall have nothing to fear or to regret","3:171":"They rejoice because of the favor from Allah and the blessings - they have seen that Allah does not waste the wage of the believers","3:172":"Those who respond to Allah and the Messenger even after being wounded or harmed in the battle, such of them have truly worked collective good and walked aright. Theirs is an outstanding reward. Responding to the call from Allah and His Messenger gives humans the real life","3:173":"When people said to them, \"A great army has assembled against you, so fear them.\" But the threat only increased them in their conviction. They said, \"Allah suffices for us and He is the best Guardian","3:174":"They marched forward with conviction and returned with Allah's favor and blessings, and no harm touched them in either case. They sought Allah's Approval, and Allah is of Infinite Bounty","3:175":"It is only Satan, your selfish desire in different guises, that instills fear. Fear not them! You shall fear Me and violating My Commands, if you are indeed believers","3:176":"Let not the conduct of those who rush to rejection, grieve you. They harm the Almighty Allah not the least bit. It is His Law that such people deprive themselves of any portion in the Hereafter. For them is an awful retribution","3:177":"Those who trade denial at the cost of belief, harm Allah not the least. For them is a painful doom","3:178":"Let not the rejecters imagine that the Law of Requital is unreal. We give reprieve to Our servants to rethink and mend their ways. Those who persist in actions that deplete the capacity of the society invite for themselves a humiliating chastisement","3:179":"Allah will not leave the believers confounded. He will clearly distinguish the good from the bad, the right from the wrong, and the true believers from the hypocrites. It is not the Purpose of Allah to let you know the unseen that the hypocrites hide in their hearts. But Allah chooses His Messengers to receive knowledge of the unseen as He Wills. So believe in Allah and His messengers. If you believe and walk aright, yours will be an Immense Reward","3:180":"Let not those, who withhold what Allah has given them from His bounties think that this hoarding is good for them. Nay, it is bad for them. Their hoarded possessions shall be their collar on the Day of Resurrection. Whatever is in the heavens and in the earth is the heritage of Allah. He bestows His provision to humanity for equitable distribution to all (55:10). And Allah is fully Informed of all your actions","3:181":"Allah has heard the taunt of those who said, \"Allah is poor and we are rich!\" They say this since most of the first followers of the Messengers have been indigent (11:27). We will record everything they say, just as We recorded their killing of the Prophets unjustly. We shall say, \"Now taste the punishment of burning","3:182":"This, because of what you have earned with your own hands. Allah is never a tyrant over His servants","3:183":"It is they (the Children of Israel) who say, \"God has taken a promise from us that we shall not believe in any Messenger unless he brings us a burnt offering.\" (An animal sacrifice that a fire from the heaven shall consume, or that burning of the sacrifice shall be an ordinance). Say (O Prophet), \" Messengers before me came to you with clear Revelations, and as you claim, with burnt offering. Why then did you slay them?\" (I Thessalonians ii, 15 / Matthew xxiii)","3:184":"If they reject you (O Messenger), remember they have rejected Messengers before you who came with clear signs, the Psalms and Divine Revelation giving Light","3:185":"Every living being shall have to taste death. On the Resurrection Day you shall be paid in full what you have earned. Whoever is drawn away from the Fire, and gets admitted to Paradise, will have gained supreme triumph. Those who consider the life of the world as the end in itself should know that it is only a comfort of self-deception. The real success depends on striving for this world and for the Hereafter (2:201), (10:6)","3:186":"O You who have attained belief! You will be tried in (establishing and defending the Divine System) in wealth, life, labor and resolve. You will be tested in your families, your people and in your character. You will hear much ridicule from those who were given the scripture before you, and from the idolaters. If you persevere and walk aright, this will be a confirmation of your determination","3:187":"Allah took a Covenant from those who received the Scripture, \"You shall convey the Message to people and never conceal it.\" But they flung it behind their backs, and traded it away for a little gain. What a miserable bargain","3:188":"(And yet they exult in that!) Think not that those who boast about their works, and love to be praised for what they have not done -- Think not, they can escape chastisement. For them is an awful suffering","3:189":"To Allah belongs the Dominion of the heavens and the earth. He has Power over all things and events","3:190":"In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are signs for men and women of understanding","3:191":"Men and women of understanding keep learning how Allah's Laws are operational in the Universe. While standing, sitting and on their sides, whatever state they are in, they observe and reflect upon the wonders of Allah's creation in the heavens and the earth, in the Highs and the Lows. They exclaim, \"Our Lord! You did not create all this in vain, be You glorified! Save us from the retribution of the Fire.\" As the humans harness the Universal Laws, coupled with adopting the Divine Value System, they shall move away from hell and get closer to establishing a Paradise on earth","3:192":"Reflecting on the Universe and upon their own role on the Planet, such people work for the betterment of humanity (13:17). They say, \"Our Lord, whomever You commit to Hell, are the ones You have forsaken because they had forsaken You (59:19). For those who displace reflection with conjecture there are no helpers","3:193":"Our Lord! We have heard a caller calling to Faith, \"Believe you in your Lord!\" (The caller being the Book of Nature to which these verses are drawing our attention). And we have believed. Our Lord! Grant us the protection of your forgiveness, save us from trailing behind in humanity, help us correct our inequities, and let us be among those who advanced their personality before they passed on","3:194":"They also say, \"Our Lord! Since we have believed in the Messengers and tried to translate this belief into action, grant us what You promised through them. Save us from humiliation on the Day when humanity will stand on its feet, in this world and in the Hereafter. Verily, You never break Your Promise","3:195":"And their Lord has heard them, \"I never let the effort of any worker, male or female, go vain. Men and women are from one another, so their Recompense shall be equal. Those who emigrated, or were driven out of their homes, and suffered harm in My Cause, and fought and were slain, I shall blot their inequities. The imprints of their misdeeds on their \"Self\" will be erased. I shall admit them into Gardens with rivulets flowing beneath.\" A Reward from Allah. And with Allah is the best Reward","3:196":"(O Prophet) Let it not deceive you that the rejecters of the Truth seem to be able to do on earth as they please","3:197":"It is but a brief enjoyment. Hell is their resting place; what a miserable bed to lie on! (They invested not in the Hereafter)","3:198":"Those who walked aright as enjoined by their Lord, for them are scenic Gardens, with rivulets flowing beneath, a Gift of Welcome from their Lord. And the reward from Allah is the best for such people who have grown in humanity and eased the way for others","3:199":"Among the People of the Book are some who believe in Allah, and in that which is revealed to you, and in what was revealed to them. They humble themselves before Allah. They trade away not Allah's Revelations for a little gain. Verily, their Reward is with their Lord and Allah is Swift in account","3:200":"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Be patient in adversity, outdo others in endurance, and remain united strengthening the bond of mutual brotherhood. Be mindful of your duty to Allah and be assured that your efforts will bear fruit","4:1":"The noble goal of the development of human personality can be easier achieved in a benevolent society (9:111), (16:71), (43:32), (59:9). In this situation the individual and the society complement each other (14:34). At the outset, it is imperative for you, O Mankind, to know that all of you, men and women, have a common origin. Your Lord began the creation of life at the unicellular level. There was one life cell that divided into two, male and female (6:99). Evolution took place, as has been alluded to in this Book (16:8), (20:50), (21:30), (22:45), (30:20), (31:28), (51:49). Eventually, numerous men and women came into existence on the earth. Since all of you have this common origin, you must consider all mankind as one community (10:19), (57:25). Your first step in that direction is to strengthen your family relations. Be careful of your duty to Allah in Whose Name you expect rights from one another. Allah ever Watches over you","4:2":"Orphans in the community are like your family members (33:5). Be vigilant in guarding their rights (4:127). Protect their property honestly, and give it to them when they have come of age. Exchange not their valuables with your worthless items, nor consume their property by combining it with yours; doing such would be a grave offense","4:3":"If you fear that the society shall not be able to do justice with orphans, (as may happen in times of war and political turbulence, the government shall announce a state of Emergency). In order to accommodate widows and orphans, men of sound finances and character shall be encouraged to marry these widows; two, three, and four (4:127). If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly, then you must not take additional wives, and may continue with what you already have (4:129). This will prevent injustice and financial hardship. (Second marriage during peace time is a FRANK violation of the Qur'an)","4:4":"Upon marriage, give women their marital gifts, a generous portion of your property, unless they forgo it voluntarily. In that case you are welcome to accept it as rightfully yours","4:5":"Do not let the immature orphans manage their property that Allah has entrusted with you as guardians, until they are able to make sound financial decisions. Feed and clothe them decently, take care of all their needs and interact with them kindly","4:6":"Train and educate the orphans well. When they reach the age of marriage, and attain sound judgment, release their property to them. The marriageable age shall mean attainment of physical and mental maturity when one can legally make a solemn contract (4:21). Do not consume their property or let it be wasted. Nor hastily spend it fearing that they will come of age. If the guardian is well off, let him claim no compensation for the management of the property. But, if he is poor he may have a just and reasonable amount. When you are releasing the property to the orphans be sure to take witnesses. Remember that Allah is Competent in taking account","4:7":"Men get a share of what the parents and near relatives leave behind. Women get a share of what the parents and near relatives leave behind. Women have the right to own property (4:12). Whether the inheritance is small or large, these shares have been ordained as a duty","4:8":"If at the time of distribution of the inheritance, relatives, orphans, and the needy are present, give them from it and treat them kindly","4:9":"The distribution of inheritance must be done responsibly and according to Law. Treat others, as you would like to be treated. You will never want injustice to be done to your children, if you leave them behind. In matters such as these, speak clearly and straight to the point","4:10":"Those, who unjustly consume the wealth of orphans, are filling their bellies with fire and will be exposed to burning Flame","4:11":"Preparing a will is a duty ordained (2:180). Allah decrees a will for the benefit of your children. (Since the sons have the responsibility to take care of the family, and daughters will be cared for by their husbands, or if unmarried, by other males in the family), sons get twice the share of daughters. If two, or more, daughters are the only inheritors, they get two-thirds. If only one daughter is left, she gets one-half. If the deceased has left any children, then parents get one-sixth each. If there are no children, and parents are the only heirs, the mother gets a third and the father gets two-thirds, since the male has the fiscal responsibility of the family. If the deceased has left brothers or sisters, the mother gets one-sixth and the father gets one third. Remember, this distribution shall take place after fulfilling the will if the deceased has left one, and after paying off all debts. As for your parents and your children, you know not which of them is more deserving of benefit from you. Such is the Ordinance from Allah. Verily, Allah is Omniscient, Wise","4:12":"Additionally: If a couple had no children, the husband gets half of what the wife leaves behind. If they had children, the husband gets one-fourth. If they had no children, then the wives get one-fourth of what the husband leaves behind. If they had children then the wife gets one-eighth. If a man or a woman, whose inheritance is in question, was a loner, in the sense of leaving behind no ascendants or descendants, but leaves behind a sister and a brother, each of them gets one-sixth of the inheritance. If there are more than two siblings, they equally share one-third of the inheritance. For a deceased who has no living parents, see (4:176), (4:177) The above applies after fully satisfying the will, and after paying of all debts, so that no one's rights are infringed upon. This is the Will decreed by Allah who is All-Knowing, Clement","4:13":"Protection of life, honor and property is the springboard of a vibrant social order. It is the pre-requisite for freedom, equality and character building to the point of self-actualization (4:24), (5:32), (13:24), (17:32), (38:52), (69:21), (89:27). Allah has drawn Boundaries of Law to help you safeguard this crucial pre-requisite. Those who refrain from trespassing these Boundaries are the ones who have obeyed the Divine System established by the Messenger. They shall be admitted to the everlasting Promised Garden that has all the aesthetic elegance that the human mind could ever imagine. That is the Supreme Success","4:14":"Conversely, those who disobey Allah and the Messenger by going against the Divine System established by the Messenger, trespass the Boundaries of the Divine Law and they will be admitted into an everlasting Fire of humiliation and regret","4:15":"Protection of honor and chastity for men and women, both, is the cornerstone of a virtuous society (17:32), (4:24). If any woman or a group of women spread sexual immorality or lewdness in the society, it is required that the appropriate court takes four honorable and reliable witnesses. If their testimony corroborates with other evidence (12:26), confine them to their houses, since immorality is as contagious as good conduct. This confinement would be for an indefinite period, unless such women seek the Way of Allah, such as repentance and amendment, or the singles among them get honorably married","4:16":"If a couple spreads such immorality or lewdness in the society, both of them shall be punished by the appropriate court of law. If they repent and amend, leave them alone. Allah is the Acceptor of repentance, Merciful","4:17":"Allah graciously accepts the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance, and then return quickly to the right conduct. Allah turns to them in Mercy. He is the Knower, the Wise","4:18":"The forgiveness is not for those who commit transgressions until death comes to one of them and he says, \" Behold, I repent now.\" (They have no time to make mends).

It is not lawful for you to force women into marrying or holding on to them in marriage against their will. Pressuring women to remain in wedlock by threatening to take away the marital gift is forbidden. A wife could forfeit the right to the marital gift only if she has indulged in clear lewdness. You shall treat your wives nicely. Even if you dislike them, it may happen that Allah has placed much good in what you have failed to realize","4:20":"If you wish to marry another wife in place of your present wife, and you have given her a great deal, you shall not take back anything.

Also forbidden are women who have ever been the wives of your sons. You are not allowed to keep two sisters in wedlock at one time except what has already happened in the past. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","4:24":"Also forbidden to you are women who are already married, except those women who have sought asylum with you against their disbelieving husbands at war with you (60:10). This is Allah's Ordinance binding upon you. All other categories are permitted for you in marriage, with mutual consent, as confirmed by giving her a generous marital gift or dowry. You shall seek them in honest wedlock and let marriage be a fortress of chastity for the husband and wife. You shall maintain morality and go not near adultery (17:32). You like to marry women for a better quality of life, so give them their portions as a duty. And there is nothing wrong in adjusting the sum with mutual agreement after the duty has been done.

A man among you who cannot find a free believing woman willing to marry him, should have no hesitation in asking the hand of a believing maiden from her guardian. Allah knows your beliefs and reiterates that all human beings are equal in the Sight of Allah (17:70). Pay them a generous marital gift in kindness. They shall maintain moral behavior, by not committing adultery, or having secret relations. Since their upbringing has been deficient in the environment of slavery, their punishment will be half that of the free women, if they commit indecency after marriage. The permission to marry a bonded woman is for him who fears to commit sin. The better recourse is freeing her first from bondage. Men and women must be patient and exercise self-control while waiting to get married. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","4:26":"Allah would explain to you and guide you by the examples of those who were before you, and turn to you (in Mercy).

Physical cleanliness contributes to moral purity. So, take a bath after ceremonial impurity. If you are traveling, or are ill, or coming from the privy, and cannot find water, take a little clean sand or earth and lightly rub your faces and hands, before entering the Masjid.

(O Prophet) Since the Revelation given to you by your Lord brings about a Benevolent Revolution in the society, people with vested interests hate it. Many of them plunge deeper into transgression and disbelief. Consequently, Our Law has sent down into their hearts and ranks animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection.

If you repelled them, you shall be of the wrongdoers","6:53":"We thus let people distinguish one another's egos. The elite among them say, \"Are these the people among us whom Allah has favored?\" But, is not Allah best Aware of the appreciative","6:54":"When those who believe in Our Revelations come to you, say, SALAMUN ALAIKUM (Peace be upon you!) Your Lord has decreed for Himself Mercy. Thus anyone among you who commits a bad deed out of ignorance, and then repents and makes amends should know that He is Forgiving, Merciful","6:55":"We explain Our Laws to distinguish (between minor, unintended violations and) the way of the criminals who steal the fruit of others' labor","6:56":"Say, \"I am forbidden to worship and obey on whom you call instead of Allah.\" Say, \"I will not follow your desires, otherwise I will go astray and not be among the rightly guided","6:57":"Say, \"I have a manifest Proof from my Lord that you deny. I do not control the retribution you challenge me to bring. Judgment belongs to none but Allah. And no one has the Ultimate Rule. He declares the Truth and He is the Best of deciders","6:58":"Say, \"If the ultimate decision you are hastening for was up to me, the case would have been already decided. Allah is best Aware of the wrongdoers","6:59":"With Him are the keys of the Unseen. (None but He knows the subtle processes and their stages where actions culminate into their logical outcome). He knows everything in the land and in the sea. Not even a leaf falls without His knowledge. Neither is there a grain in the dark depths of the soil, nor anything fresh or withered, that He knows not. But all is written in the Open Book of the Universe around you","6:60":"He suspends your consciousness during sleep at night, and knows what you do by day, when awake. He resurrects you every morning until your life span is completed. Death is, likewise, a temporary suspension of consciousness and afterward to Him is your return (39:42). Then, He will inform you of what you really accomplished","6:61":"He is Supreme over His servants. His Laws guard your life until the inescapable Law of death approaches you. When death comes to one of you, Our couriers receive him without delay","6:62":"Then they are restored to Allah, their Rightful Master. Surely, His is the Command and His is the Judgment. And He is the most Swift of reckoners","6:63":"Say, \" Who saves you, in the darkness of the land and the sea, when you call upon Him humbly and quietly saying, \"If He saves us this time, we will always be thankful","6:64":"Say, \"It is Allah (Whose Laws you trust never to change), that protects you from different afflictions. Even then you attribute partners to Him","6:65":"Say, \"He is Able to send punishment upon you from above you or from beneath your feet, or to bewilder you with dissension and make you taste the tyranny one of another. (Violation of His Laws can inflict you from the top in the form of tyrannical rule, or from the bottom in the form of popular rebellion. You could then divide into hateful parties, and taste smite of one another). Note how We use TASREEF, explaining Our Verses from various vantage points, that men and women may understand","6:66":"Even then, (O Messenger) Your people deny the Truth. Tell them, \"I have not been appointed a guardian over you","6:67":"Every tiding given in the Qur'an shall come to pass and you mankind will surely find out","6:68":"When you see men and women engaged in mocking Our Verses, ignore them until they turn to a different theme. If your mind gets engrossed in their discourse, then as soon as you recollect, no longer sit with them. Those who displace decent dialogue with mockery indeed wrong their own \"Self","6:69":"Those who walk aright bear no responsibility for them, except decent follow up reminders, so that the fellow human beings might reflect and come to walk the Right Path","6:70":"Leave to themselves those who take their religion as nothing but pastime, amusement, games of ritual, and social partying; their life revolving around quick gains of the worldly life. But follow up with reminders with the Qur'an on appropriate occasions. Remind people lest a \"Self\" be ruined for its own actions. No \"Self\" has a protecting friend, master or intercessor against the Law of Allah even if it offered any conceivable ransom. Such is the end of those who land themselves into ruin with their own actions. For them is a draught of burning despair and a painful doom. They had kept denying the Truth","6:71":"Say, \"Should we call unto those who can neither benefit nor harm us, and turn back on our heels after Allah has guided us aright? In that situation we would be like the person who is left wandering enticed by his satanic thoughts, stranded in the desert of doubt. And his companions trying to guide him: Come to us! Say, \"The guidance of Allah is Guidance, and we are commanded to submit to the Lord of the Worlds","6:72":"And to establish the Divine System and walk aright. He it is to Whom you will be summoned","6:73":"He has created the heavens and the earth with a definite Plan. Whenever He says \"Be!\" it is. His Word is the Truth and comes True. As ever, His will be the Dominion on the Day when the Trumpet is blown (of Resurrection). Knower of the invisible and the visible, He is the Wise, the Aware","6:74":"Remember when Abraham said to his father Azar (Terah), \"How could you worship idols as gods? I see you and your people are in obvious error.\" (Azar is called Terah in the Bible and Zarah in Talmud)","6:75":"We gave Abraham insight, the ability to reflect, into the Mighty Dominion of the Universe so that he might attain firm conviction","6:76":"(Some of his people were idolaters and others were Nature worshipers.) One night when it grew dark upon him he saw a star. Abraham exclaimed to them, \"This is my Lord!\" But when it went down, he said, \"I love not the things that go down","6:77":"(The other night) when the moon was rising, he exclaimed, \"This is my Lord.\" But when it went down, he said to himself and to the people, \"Unless my Lord guides me, I surely will go astray","6:78":"(In the morning) he saw the sun rising in splendor, and he said, \"This is my Lord! This is greater!\" But, as the sun went down, Abraham exclaimed, \"O My people! I am free from all that you associate with God","6:79":"I have focused firmly on Him Who initiated the heavens and the earth; as an upright man I turn away from all that is false. I will never be an idol worshiper in any form","6:80":"His people argued with him, but Abraham said, \"You dispute with me about Allah when He has guided me? I have no fear of the idols you set up. Nothing can happen to me contrary to the Laws of Allah. My Lord's Knowledge encompasses all things. Will you not then, use your intellect?\" (This is how Abraham tried that his people reflect and be rational)","6:81":"He said, \"Why should I fear that which you set up beside Him, when you fear not to set up beside Allah, deities for which He has sent no authority and that are utterly powerless. Think which of the two sides among us deserves peace and security?

They are rightly guided","6:83":"This is the logic (examples of the star, the moon and the sun) that We taught Abraham against his people. We exalt people in ranks when they follow Our Laws. Your Lord is Wise, All-Knowing","6:84":"We gave him Isaac the son, and Jacob the grandson, and We guided them. Before Abraham, We guided Noah and from his descendants, We guided David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. We thus reward the benefactors of humanity","6:85":"And Zachariah, John, Jesus and Elias; all in the ranks of the righteous who fulfilled the needs of mankind","6:86":"And Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah, and Lot. To all of them We gave distinction over people of their times","6:87":"And We gave distinction to some of their ancestors, children and siblings and guided them to the Straight Path","6:88":"This is the Guidance of Allah. He guides His servants according to His Laws (4:88). If they had associated others with Allah, their actions would have been vain","6:89":"They were the ones to whom We gave the Scripture, Sound Judgment and Prophethood. Now, if these people reject these truths, We have entrusted these truths to people who will not refuse to acknowledge them","6:90":"Those were the ones guided by Allah, so follow their guidance. Say, (O Messenger), \"I ask of you no wage for this. This (Guidance in the Qur'an) is but a Reminder to all nations","6:91":"People do not value Allah as He must be valued when they say, \"Allah has not revealed His Message to any human being.\" Ask them, \"Who then revealed the Scripture which Moses brought, a Light and Guidance for people? Although you put it down on parchment which you show, but you conceal a lot. You were taught what neither you, nor your ancestors knew before.\" Say, \"Allah (revealed it).\" Then leave them to play at their vain talk","6:92":"And this Qur'an is the Blessed Book that We have sent down, confirming the Divine Origin of what was revealed before it, that you (O Prophet) may warn the Central Town, Makkah, and places around it. (From this Center, the Message will fan out (6:90), (12:104)). Those who believe in (the Law of Recompense) the Hereafter, accept this Book as a comprehensive Guide. And they will establish the Divine System","6:93":"Who can be a greater wrongdoer than the one who fabricates a lie against Allah, or claims receiving Revelation while he has received none? Or someone who says, \"I, too, can bestow the like of what Allah has bestowed.\" If only you could see such transgressors reach the pangs of death! The angels extend their hands to them saying, \"Bring out your egos. This day you will be awarded a punishment of disgrace for speaking lies concerning Allah, and being arrogant to His revelations","6:94":"Now you have come to Us alone just as We created you individuals the first time. You have left behind all your belongings. We do not see with you the intercessors you idolized. Now all ties among you have been cut off and your assumptions have failed you","6:95":"Allah is the One Who causes the grains and the seeds to split and germinate. He produces the living from the dead, and the dead from the living. Such is Allah. Where are you headed in bewilderment? (Similar are the Laws that apply to individuals and nations. They must develop their inherent potentials in order to prosper)","6:96":"He is the Cleaver of the daybreak.

With it We produce vegetation of all kind; green multitudes, complex grains, palm trees, from their pollens spring pendant clusters, and gardens of grapes, olives and pomegranate; fruits that are similar and diverse. Look upon the fruit thereof and look upon its ripening. These are signs for those who reach conviction through reason","6:100":"Yet, there are people who think falsely that there are invisible creatures, Jinns, with occult powers that share the Divine Attributes. But He has created them, and people assign sons and daughters to Him out of sheer ignorance. Glorified, Exalted is He, infinitely Above what they ascribe to Him","6:101":"Wonderful Originator of the heavens and the earth! How can He have a son when He never chose for Himself a mate? He creates all things (and does not procreate (112:3)) and He is the Profound Knower of all things and events","6:102":"Such is Allah, your Sustainer. There is no god but He. No one is worthy of worship and obedience but He, the Creator of all things. Hence, obey Him! He is the Guardian of all and takes care of every thing","6:103":"No vision can encompass Him while He encompasses all vision. He is Subtile, Unfathomable, and therefore beyond physical perception. He is Aware of the minutest details","6:104":"(You are not expected to know His Person.) Say (O Prophet), \"The manifest Enlightenment has come to you from your Lord. Whoever sees the Truth, does so for his own good. And whoever turns blind, hurts himself. I am not your keeper or guardian","6:105":"And thus We give many facets to Our verses that they might realize that, \"You (O Prophet) have indeed taken these teachings deep down in your heart.\" (Allah has taught the Messenger in the most beautiful manner). And through this method of TASREEF We make the Message clear to those who use their perceptual knowledge","6:106":"Follow that which is revealed to you from your Lord. There is no god but He. And disregard those who associate others with Him (21:20-2)","6:107":"We could have created all people without free will and they would then not associate any partners with Him. (But guidance has been distinguished from straying (2:256)). And We have not appointed you (O Messenger) as their guardian, nor are you responsible for them","6:108":"O Believers! Insult not the idols they set up besides Allah. They might insult Allah in their ignorance and hurt themselves. To every community Our Law has made their deeds seem fair. Then unto their Lord is their return and He will inform them what they accomplished and He will make them understand what they really used to do in life","6:109":"They swear by Allah that if a miracle comes to them, they would surely believe in it (the Book). Say, \"All miracles are with Allah (if you reflect on the Universe). What can make you understand that even if a physical miracle came to them, they will find other excuses and still not believe","6:110":"Our Law keeps their hearts and their eyes turned away from the Truth. Since they have preemptively rejected it (the Qur'an), We let them wander blindly in their rebellious attitude","6:111":"Even if We caused the angels to descend to them, and the dead to speak to them, and We lined up all the miracles before them, they would not believe. People can be guided only according to Allah's Laws, but most of them choose the way of ignorance","6:112":"Thus We have appointed to every Prophet enemies. The rebellious among the urban and the rural populations rose in opposition, (since the Message struck at their vested interests). They plotted and inspired each other with fancy words. If your Lord willed, they won't do that. (But, challenges come your way only to expand your personalities (2:286)). (O Prophet) Leave them alone with their fabrications","6:113":"Those who love quick gains and neglect the long-term benefits and the Hereafter, are parties to such fabrications. Let them delight in it and let them earn from it what they may","6:114":"Say, \"Shall I seek for Judge and Ruler someone other than Allah? He it is Who has revealed this Book, well expounded in detail for you.\" Those whom We have given the Book know that this is revealed in Truth from your Lord. Be not among those who argue for the sake of argument","6:115":"Perfected is the Word of your Lord in Truth and Justice. None can change His Words and His Laws. This announcement comes to you from the Profound Hearer, the Knower","6:116":"(People will confront you with what the majority is doing.) Now if you pay heed to, or get intimidated by majority of those who live on earth, they will lead you astray from Allah's Way.

But what the majority thinks shall never be the criterion 3:93). So eat of that which Allah has made Permissible, if you are indeed believers in His Revelations","6:119":"Why should you not eat of that on which Allah's Name has been pronounced (i.e. it is not dedicated to other than Him)? He has explained to you in detail what is forbidden along with certain exceptions in dire need (5:3). Numerous of the clergy mislead people in this matter without knowledge, and with their personal opinions. Verily, your Lord is fully Aware of those who go beyond moderation","6:120":"Abstain from violating the Divine Commands, whether openly or secretly. Those who drag down their \"Self\" by such violations will be awarded what they have earned. (They will live a subhuman existence and meet a befitting consequence)","6:121":"Eat not anything (not just meat) unless the Name of Allah has been pronounced first, for that will mean drifting away from Commands. The rebellious among people inspire their companions to dispute with you. If you people heed them, you will be associating others with Allah","6:122":"(Our Light revives the living dead and makes them walk honorably among mankind.) Is one who was dead and We gave him life with Light that enables him to move among people, equal to one in total darkness from which he cannot come out? (When people have their belief system jumbled up, they lose the power to distinguish between the right and wrong). Hence, the rejecters of the Truth find their own deeds pleasing","6:123":"This is how We allow the greatest ones in every community to become its greatest criminals, to weave their schemes. Yet it is only against themselves that they scheme without even knowing it","6:124":"When a Message comes to them, they say, \"We will not believe until we are directly given what Allah's Messengers are given.\" But, Allah knows best with whom to place His Message. Such criminals will be humiliated by Allah's Law of Requital, and suffer a heavy punishment for their scheming","6:125":"Whoever follows Allah's Law of Guidance, He expands his chest wide open to submission. And whoever violates Allah's Law of Guidance, feels his chest tight and narrowed as if he were climbing to the sky. Thus Allah's Law appoints disgrace for those who continue to reject the Truth","6:126":"And this (Qur'an) is the Path of your Lord, a Straight Path. Clearly indeed have We detailed Our Revelations for those who pay attention and take them to their heart","6:127":"For them is the wonderful Abode of Peace with their Sustainer. He will be their Protecting Friend because of what they used to do","6:128":"The day will come when He gathers all of them and says, \"O You nomads! You have seduced many of the urbanites.\" Their urbanite friends will say, \"Our Lord! We enjoyed each other's company (and both used each other opportunistically as happens in a chaotic society) until we wasted a life span You had given us. He will say, \"Fire is your home. Abide therein forever since Allah's Laws never change.

(The criminals of the same kind tend to hang around together)","6:130":"O You, assembly of the nomads and the urbanites! Did not Messengers come to you from among you, who conveyed to you My Messages and warned you of the meeting of this your Day? They will say, \"We testify against ourselves.\" Pursuit of only the worldly life preoccupied their hearts and minds. They will bear witness against themselves that they disregarded the Truth","6:131":"And so it is that your Lord never destroys communities arbitrarily while their people are unaware of their wrongdoings","6:132":"The ranks of all individuals and nations are determined solely by their deeds, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do. (Calling yourselves believers won't help)","6:133":"Your Lord is Absolute, the Lord of Mercy. He could replace you with whomever He Will, like He raised you from the generations of other folk.(It is His Mercy that He does Justice to peoples without discrimination, and His Rule is the Rule of Law)","6:134":"That which you are promised will surely come to pass, and you can never evade the Divine Laws","6:135":"Say (to the opponents O Messenger), \"O My people! Do all that is in your power. Behold, I am working. Very soon, you will come to know for which of us is the ultimate success. Violators of human rights will never be successful","6:136":"(How can their program succeed when their belief system and the resulting actions are wrong?) They set aside a portion of Allah's provision of crops and cattle and claim, \"This is for Allah, and this is for our idols.\" But the share of their idols never reaches Allah, and the share of Allah does reach their idols. What an unjust decision they make! (Their priesthood devours both portions of their making, and the poor remain wanting. To Allah reaches what you spend on the needy)","6:137":"(At the prompting of the mystics and monks, and in the name of their temples, idols, sanctuaries, and the dead \"holy\" men and women), the MUSHRIKEEN do acts of omission and commission against their own children! They inflict great pain upon themselves and their families in the name of religion. If they followed Allah's Commands, they wouldn't have done it. (Since they take this abuse as a part of their plan to salvation, for the moment), leave them alone with their fabrications (until Reality gazes them in the eyes)","6:138":"And they say, \"Such and such cattle and fruits of the field are sacred. No one will eat of them except whom we permit.\" They also arbitrarily prohibit the riding of some animals (saying that it has been dedicated to some elite or saint. Aren't such VIP favors very much alive in the modern day JAHILYAH?) And there are cattle over which they pronounce not the Name of Allah (but of someone else to please people). Such are their fabrications in His Name. Soon He will reward them for their false imagery","6:139":"(They display their bias toward women in weird ways.) They say, \"What is in the bellies of these cattle is reserved for the males among us, and forbidden to our wives.\" But if it is a stillbirth, they permit their wives to share it. He, the Wise, the Knower, will repay them for their innovations","6:140":"Lost indeed are those who kill their children foolishly, and forbid what Allah has provided them as sustenance. And they attribute their innovations to Allah! (They deprive their children to the point of starvation and death in the name of religious service, when under the instructions of the priesthood they abandon their families). Their straying is far from the way of the rightly guided","6:141":"He it is Who creates Bounties for you, such as gardens that are cultivated, greens that are wild, palm trees of various kinds, crops in diversity, olives and pomegranates, fruits that are similar and diverse. Enjoy them, but give Him His Right. Render the poor what is their Divine Right, on the day of the harvest. This is how you shall give Allah His Right. Do not waste the Bounty of Allah. He does not love the wasteful","6:142":"Among the large and small quadrupeds some are for work and transportation and others for flesh, and their skins for bedding materials. Enjoy what Allah has provided you. And follow not the footsteps of Satan. Satan, your selfish desire, is your open enemy","6:143":"Take the example of eight quadrupeds: Two sheep, one male and one female, two goats, one male and one female.

Tell me if you have true knowledge","6:144":"Then two camels, one male and one female, two cows, one male and one female. Say, \"Is it the two males that He has forbidden, or the two females, or the calves in the wombs of the two females? Were you witnesses when Allah made such prohibitions? Who can be a greater transgressor than the one who invents a lie and attributes it to Allah? They mislead people without knowledge. Allah does not intervene to guide those who displace knowledge with conjecture","6:145":"Say, \"I do not find in the Revelation given to me, any food that is prohibited for one who wishes to eat except: Carrion (dead meat), running blood as against organ meats, the flesh of swine for it is disapproved, or anything (not just meat) which, in disobedience, has been dedicated to other than Allah.\" If one is forced by dire need without being deliberate and without transgressing, your Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.","6:146":"For those who are Jewish, We had prohibited some edibles, such as animals with undivided hoof, the fat of the cow and the sheep, except that which is carried on their backs or on their intestines, or what is mixed-up in the bone.

We are indeed True to Our Word","6:147":"If they accuse you of falsehood (O Prophet), tell them, \"Your Lord is a Lord of Infinite Mercy, but His Requital will not be averted from the guilty","6:148":"Those who associate others with Allah will say, \"Had Allah willed, we would not practice idolatry, nor would our ancestors, nor would we prohibit anything.\" So did their ancestors argue falsely until they tasted Our Requital.

We do not assign any \"Self\" responsibility beyond its means. And when you voice an opinion, be just, even if it is against a relative.

Our Law of Requital will award those who turn away from Our Revelations, an awful suffering for their disregard","6:158":"Are they waiting for angels, your Lord, or some physical miracles to come to them? On the Day one of such Signs comes, no person will benefit from declaring belief if he did not believe before. Or who, while believing, did not do good works.

He was not of the subservient","7:12":"God said, \"What stopped you from being subservient when I ordered you?\" Iblis responded, \"I am better than he. You created me from fire, and him from clay.\" (Emotions are fiery in relation to sound judgment. The criterion of honor is not lineage, color, caste or nation. It is nothing but good conduct)","7:13":"(Recall that many of the verses of the Qur'an are allegorical.) God said, \"You are dismissed and degraded hence. It is not for you to be arrogant here. Go forth, then! Among the humiliated you shall be","7:14":"He (Iblis) said, \"Give me respite till the Day they are raised up","7:15":"The request was granted, \" Be among those who are given respite","7:16":"Iblis said, \"Since You have willed that I go astray, I will lurk in ambush for them in Your Straight Path","7:17":"Then I will assault them openly and secretly, through their strengths and through their weaknesses. And You will not find most of them grateful (for Your Guidance)","7:18":"He said, \"Go forth from here, degraded and banished. Whoever follows you among them, I will surely fill hell with you all","7:19":"O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Garden and eat from whatever you may wish; but do not approach this one tree, lest you become wrong doers.\" (Contrary to the popular beliefs that the Forbidden Tree was the tree of knowledge, fruit of this plant and that plant, or of sexual charms, it refers to humanity dividing itself like the branches of a tree (2:35-36), (2:2)","7:20":"Then Satan deceived them in order to reveal their imperfections and fallibility to them. He said, \"Your Lord forbade this tree lest you become angels or become immortals.\" (The selfish desire of humans prompted them to think about their own children rather than the collective good. That would, in a way, give them power and immortality)","7:21":"And Satan swore to both, man and woman, \"I am a sincere advisor to you","7:22":"So by deceit Satan brought about their downfall. They tasted of the tree of discord and started to divide into branches. (Personal interest dominated their minds rather than the collective good of all. Humanity began to fall into mutual contention). Soon their imperfections became obvious and they tried to conceal them in vain with superficial courtesy. Then came a reminder from their Lord, \"Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you that Satan is your open enemy","7:23":"They said, \"Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. Unless You forgive us and have mercy on us, we will certainly be lost.\" (Man and woman accepted responsibility acknowledging that they had free will as against Satan who had ascribed his disobedience to the Will of Allah)","7:24":"(Self interests of people had given rise to unjust marking of land and individual hoarding. Suppression of the weak had begun). Allah told them that they had fallen down from the high station of humanity. They had ignored the Law that \"Mankind is one community\" (10:19). From then on, they would live as tribes and nations, enemies to one another, \"There will be for you on land an abode and sustenance for a while","7:25":"He said, \"You shall live in the earth and die there and be resurrected from there.\" (In the meantime they could regain their lost paradise if they followed the Divine Commands)","7:26":"O Children of Adam! We have provided you with garments to cover your bodies as well as to adorn you. The best garment for you to wear, in addition, is good conduct. Your character decorates you inside out. These are the verses of Allah that they must take to heart","7:27":"O Children of Adam! Let not your selfish desire deceive you as it deceived your ancestors, caused them to lose their paradise, and exposed their imperfections. A host of selfish and rebellious desires lurk within you. You can't even see them but these Satans see you and befriend those who do not believe","7:28":"(As an example) when people commit an indecency they say, \"We found our forefathers doing it and Allah has enjoined it upon us.\" (Made it natural for us). Say (O Prophet), \"Allah never enjoins indecency. Do you attribute to Allah of which you have no knowledge","7:29":"Say (O Messenger), \"My Lord enjoins justice and moderation and to stand devoted to Him alone in complete obedience. Call unto Him, sincere in your Faith in Him alone. He it is Who brought you into being in the first place, and to Him you will return.\" (And this is how you can regain your lost Paradise in both worlds)","7:30":"But there will be two parties among people. Some of them will walk aright according to the Divine Laws of Guidance while others will ally with Satans as their friends. They take their religious leadership as their masters instead of Allah, and think that they are rightly guided","7:31":"O Children of Adam! Subservience and obedience to the Divine Commands ensures for you adornment and nice things in life. So enjoy Allah's Bounties, but do not commit excesses. Allah does not love the wasters","7:32":"Say, \"Who has forbidden the beauty and nice things Allah has brought forth for His servants, and the pure clean things of your choice?\" Say, \"Such things are for those in this world who practically believe in the Divine Laws. And on the Day of Resurrection they will be exclusively for those who attained Conviction.\" We thus explain Our Laws for those who make good use of what they learn","7:33":"Say, \"My Lord forbids only: Indecent shameful deeds, open or secret. Actions that hurt the \"Self\" and drag down the individual and collective human potential. Unjust aggression. Idol worship in any form. It has been completely unauthorized by Allah. And that you say things about Allah that you know not","7:34":"All nations and communities determine the terms of their Rise and Fall in accordance with these Divine Laws. And these Laws work with meticulous timing, without delay and without hastening","7:35":"O Children of Adam! (I had revealed in the early stages of human civilization that I will keep sending My Guidance to you (2:213)). So, when Messengers of your own come to you narrating My Messages, those who will walk aright and mend their ways, will have nothing to fear or grieve","7:36":"On the other hand, those who reject Our Revelations and scorn them, will dwell in the Hellfire to live therein, forever","7:37":"Who can do a greater wrong than the one who invents lies about Allah, or belies His Revelations? They get their due share according to the Law of Respite till Our couriers of death come to them saying, \"Where are those on whom you called besides Allah?\" They will respond, \" They have left us hanging.\" Then they will testify against themselves that they had been disbelievers","7:38":"Allah will command them to join the previous rural and urban communities into the Fire. Every later group will blame the former, \"Our Lord! These are the ones who misled us; double their punishment.\" He will say, \"The punishment is doubled for both.\" (The first group violated the Laws and misled others, and the second group was guilty of blind following and misleading their successors)","7:39":"The first nation will say to the last, \"You are not the least bit better than us. So taste the doom for what you earned","7:40":"Those who deny Our Messages, and scorn them, the gates of Heaven will not be opened for them. And they will not enter the Garden until the camel goes through the eye of a needle. This is how We recompense the guilty. (Likewise nations that ignore the Divine Laws will utterly fail to establish a paradise on earth)","7:41":"Hell is their bed and their covering as well. This is how We recompense the guilty, those who steal the fruit of others' labor and thus violate human rights. (Nations that fail to build their own paradise on earth only lurk on hellish ground. They have a ceiling of chaos keeping them from rising in the community of nations)","7:42":"On the other hand, those who attain conviction in Divine Laws and work to augment the individual and collective potential of humanity, will succeed in attaining paradise of their own making (3:136). (The paradise of people's own making will never be lost; it will be their heritage in the life to come (2:25), (3:133), (55:45-47)). We never assign goals to people that are beyond their capacity","7:43":"(In earthly life human beings conceal many negative feelings that they have towards others even though they may have cordial relations with them). We will remove all negative emotions from their hearts. There will be no such feelings amongst the dwellers of earthly and heavenly Paradise wherein streams will flow. (The blessings of such a Social Order would be everlasting!) They will say: \"All Praise is due to Allah Who has guided us to such a beautiful destination. Without Divine guidance we would never have reached this place. Allah's Messengers brought to us this Truth. It will be proclaimed: \"This is the Paradise which you have inherited; and since you have inherited this Paradise as a result of your own effort, you will not be expelled from it","7:44":"The dwellers of the Garden will call out to the dwellers of the Fire, \"We have found that what our Sustainer promised us has come true. Have you too, found that what your Sustainer promised you has come true?\" They will answer, \"Yes!\" Then from their midst a voice will proclaim, \"Allah rejects the oppressors who wrongfully violated human rights","7:45":"They hindered men and women from the Path of Allah and tried to make it crooked, thus practically denying the Law of Requital and the life Hereafter","7:46":"Between the people of Paradise and Hell there will be a veil. On the Heights there will be people with insight who will recognize others by their looks. They will greet those who, in their estimate, are worthy of entering the Garden, with \"Peace!\" (2:143), (4:4)","7:47":"When they turn to the ones who have been living a hellish life, they will say, \"Our Lord! Keep us away from the ways of the wrongdoers and violators of human rights","7:48":"The people on the Heights will recognize another group and say to them, \"How did your multitude, the wealth you amassed and the things you took pride in, help you","7:49":"And pointing to the dwellers of the Garden, they will say, \"Are these not the people about whom you used to swear that Allah will never bestow His Grace upon them? They are entering the Garden where there will be no fear or grief.\" (They will make it clear that the Divine Law favors no particular peoples. Obeying His Laws brings His Grace and Bounties\"). Follow His Laws and, \"Enter the paradise of your own making, the society where there shall be no fear nor grief","7:50":"The dwellers of Hell will say to the dwellers of Paradise, \"Give us something of the life-giving resources and the provisions bestowed on you by Allah.\" They will reply, \"Allah has made these things forbidden to the rejecters of His Laws.\" (The hellish societies will expect Allah's provisions to be granted to them as free-bees. They will be told that Allah's Bounties can only be achieved by establishing the Right System, and His Law forbids these Bounties to the rejecters)","7:51":"Those who took their religion as mere amusement and ritual partying, were deceived by immediate gains of the worldly life (6:70). We will forget them as they forgot the meeting of this Day, and rejected Our Revelations","7:52":"We have given them a Book of Knowledge that explains the Guidance in full detail. It is a Mercy for those who accept it. (It has the Power to change hellish societies into paradise on earth)","7:53":"Are they waiting until the consequences stare them in their eyes? The Day the consequences appear, those who disregarded it will say, \"The Messengers of our Lord did bring the Truth. Are there any intercessors to intercede on our behalf? Or can we be returned that we behave differently from our past?\" They have put their \"Self\" in loss and their own forgery fails them. (They will seek mediation for their mutual conflicts and long for starting from scratch. Since they have hurt their \"Self\", they have lost the power of judgment and they would need help. They have been fabricating unworkable systems)","7:54":"Verily, your Sustainer is Allah Who has created the heavens and the earth in six stages, and is established on the Throne of His Almightiness (10:3), (13:2). He draws the night over the day, each seeking the other in rapid succession. The sun, the moon, the stars are committed to serve by His Command. Listen and remember, to Him belongs the World of Creation, and to Him belongs the World of Command. Exalted, He is the Lord of the Worlds","7:55":"(He has the power to revive dead nations). Call unto your Lord humbly and in the secrecy of your hearts. He does not love those who transgress the bounds of what He has ordained as right","7:56":"Hence, do not spread corruption on earth after it has been set in order. Call unto Him in fear and hope. (Fear the consequences of violating His Commands and hope since you know His Promise is always true). Allah's Mercy is close to the benefactors of humanity","7:57":"He is the One who sends pleasant winds bearing good news of the forthcoming rain of His blessings. When the winds carry the heavy clouds, We drive them to a land that is dead. The water then causes all kinds of fruit and vegetation to sprout. This is how We can revive dead people and nations. Herein is a sign for those who pay heed","7:58":"The land that has been well prepared springs up rich produce by the Leave of its Lord. The land that has not been well prepared only yields scant vegetation. (Similar is the situation of nations that wish to come back to life. They need reform at the grassroots level). This is how We explain Our verses from various vantage points for those who are grateful to receive such clear Guidance","7:59":"(Now, We give you a brief resume of the previous Prophets and their nations for you to draw lessons). We sent Noah to his people. He said, \" O My people! Serve Allah. You have no other god beside Him. (If you reform not) I fear for you the retribution of an awesome day","7:60":"The chiefs of his people said, \"We surely see you in manifest error","7:61":"Noah said, \"O My people! There is no error in me. I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds","7:62":"I only convey to you the Messages of my Lord. My advice is sincere to you and I know from Allah that which you know not","7:63":"Do you wonder that there has come to you a Reminder from your Lord through a man from amongst you - to warn you, and to show you the secure path so that you may flourish in Grace","7:64":"But they denied him. So, We saved him and those with him in the ship, and drowned those who denied Our Revelations. Indeed they were folk blind in arrogance. (A great flood was about to come and Noah was informed. He and his followers built an Ark. They were with him in belief and in the ship, so were they saved)","7:65":"To the people of Aad, We sent their brother, Hud. He said, \"O My people! Serve Allah. You have no god beside Him. Don't you wish to walk aright","7:66":"The elite among his people who were disbelieving said, \"Ah! We see that you are in folly, and we think that you are a liar","7:67":"He said, \"O My people! There is no folly in me. I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds","7:68":"I convey to you the Messages of my Lord, and I am a sincere and trustworthy adviser to you","7:69":"Do you wonder that there has come to you a Reminder from your Lord through a man from amongst you, to warn you? Recall that He made you successors to Noah's people and gave you abundant power. Keep in mind Allah's Authority and Blessings that you may continue to prosper","7:70":"They said, \"Have you come to us that we worship Allah alone and give up what our forefathers worshiped? Bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are truthful","7:71":"(Aad were powerful people but their society had gone unjust. Since there is a Law of Respite for nations, they flourished and were unable to see the wrong thus far). Hud said, \"Allah's Law of Requital is already hovering over you. Do you argue with me about certain names, false authorities that you and your forefathers have fabricated? And Allah never authorized them (53:23). Then wait for the consequences, and I am also waiting","7:72":"The people of Aad who inhabited a big empire in the North of Arabia, failed to heed the warning of the Prophet. Then hurricane winds annihilated them (41:16)). We saved him and those with him by Mercy from Us, and cut the root of those who belied Our Messages and would not believe","7:73":"The people of Thamud were successors to Aad. To them We sent their brother, Saleh. He said, \"O My people! Serve Allah. You have no other god but He. The Clear Truth has come to you from your Lord. This is the she-camel of Allah, a token for your obedience. So let her feed in Allah's earth and do not harm her lest painful torment seize you.\" (Their feudal lords controlled land, crop, oases and water resources, and the weak were suffering. Saleh assigned a she-camel as a symbol of their reformation)","7:74":"Saleh said, \"Remember how He made you inherit the land after Aad and established you therein. You build castles in the valleys and carve out homes in the mountains. So, remember Allah's bounties and do not spread corruption in the land","7:75":"Their leaders said to the believers, \"How do you know that Saleh is sent from his Lord?\" They responded, \"We believe in the Message he has brought.\" (The bringer of such Sublime Message cannot be a liar)","7:76":"(The arrogant leaders and the feudal lords could see their vested interests getting hit, so they decided to reject the Divine Message.) The arrogant ones said to the believers, \"We reject what you believe in","7:77":"They killed the she-camel, rebelled against their Lord's Command and challenged, \"O' Saleh! Bring the doom you threaten us with, if you are really a Messenger","7:78":"(In their life of luxury, like other strong nations they felt invincible.) The destruction came from under their feet. A powerful earthquake annihilated them, leaving them lifeless in their homes","7:79":"Saleh was grieved that his people disregarded the Message of his Lord. He moved away from the township saying to himself, \"O My people! I gave my Lord's Message to you, and advised you sincerely, but you never liked good advisers","7:80":"(Hud, Saleh, and their respective followers, escaped destruction because they believed in the Revelation and took appropriate precautions. The people of Prophet Lot lived by the Dead Sea in Sodom.) Lot told them, \"You commit such an abomination that no one in the worlds has done before you","7:81":"You approach men with lust in preference to women. Nay, but you are a people crossing all bounds","7:82":"They said, \"Drive them out of your town! These people want to be models of purity","7:83":"We saved him and his followers. But his wife who lagged behind in belief stayed with the crowd, and was destroyed","7:84":"(It was the time when a huge volcano was about to erupt. The Prophet of God had advance knowledge and he moved out at the right time, along with his followers.) And We rained a rain upon them (a huge shower of stones). See now how grievous was the outcome of the guilty","7:85":"(And there was the Nation of Midyan that lived between Madinah and Damascus since around 2000 B.C. They were the descendants of Prophet Abraham's son MIDYAN from his third wife QATOORA. Most of them were traders but they squandered justice and equity in business.) We sent Shoaib (Jethro), their brother, to them (around 1300 BC). He said, \"O My people! Obey Allah. There is none else worthy of obedience and Law-giving. Now has come to you the clear evidence of Truth from your Lord. Be loyal to measure and weight in all your dealings. Withhold not from people the things that are rightfully theirs. Do not corrupt the earth after it has been set straight. All this will be better for you if you would but believe. Learn from history about the outcome of the corrupt and the bloody criminals","7:86":"Lurk not on every road threatening travelers, and hindering from the Path of Allah those who believe in Him. Nor seek to make it crooked. Remember, when you were few and weak and how He multiplied and strengthened you. Learn from history about the outcome of the corrupt and the bloody criminals","7:87":"A group among you has believed in what I have been sent with and the other group has not believed. Then have patience (let the believers work their program of reform), until Allah judges between us. He is the Best of deciders","7:88":"The arrogant leaders of his community said, \"O Shoaib! We will certainly drive you and those who believe with you out of our town unless you return to our ways.\" Shoaib said, \"Why, even though we detest your ways","7:89":"Shall we forge a lie against Allah by embracing your ways when He has rescued us from the wrong? How could we revert to your ways and thus violate the Will of Allah, our Sustainer? Our Lord encompasses all things in Knowledge, (and He knows what is right and what is wrong). In Allah do we put our trust. O Our Lord! Make the Truth triumph between our people and us. You are the best Exponent of the Truth","7:90":"But the disbelieving chiefs of his nation said, \"O People! If you follow Shoaib, then truly we will be ruined (as we lose the big profits in our trade)","7:91":"A tremendous earthquake seized them and the morning found them dead in their homes, on the ground","7:92":"Those who denied Shoaib became as though they had never lived there.

As he was leaving, he said, \"O My people! I delivered my Lord's Messages to you and gave you sincere advice. How could I mourn for people who rejected the Truth","7:94":"We sent no Prophet to a community without Our Law of Requital trying them with adversity and tribulation for their wrongdoings, so that they become humble","7:95":"Then We changed their plight for good till they became affluent. Then they said, \"(Hardships and prosperity are just a matter of chance). Even our parents and forefathers have gone through these ups and downs.\" Our Requital seized them when they least expected it. (To them it appeared sudden, but unjust systems insidiously move towards the consequences)","7:96":"If the people of the towns had believed in the Divine Laws and run their system aright, We would have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth. But they denied and what they earned with their deeds seized them","7:97":"Can the people of any community ever feel secure that Our Requital will not come upon them at night, while they are asleep","7:98":"Or do the people of townships feel secure from the coming of Our Requital upon them in the daytime while they play","7:99":"Do they feel secure from the subtle progression of the Divine Laws? Do they think that the Divine Law grants them unconditional security? Only the losers feel secure from the subtle progression of Allah's Law of Requital","7:100":"Is it not a lesson for those who inherit the earth from previous generations that they could suffer similar consequences? Trailing behind in the community of nations is a tribulation in itself. And Our Law can cause their intellectual and perceptual faculties to be sealed and blunted for their failings","7:101":"Such were the communities whose historical accounts We relate to you (O Prophet). Their Messengers came to them with clear evidence of Truth. But they preemptively rejected it, and then stuck to rejection. Or they denied the Truth in blind following since their ancestors had denied it. This is how the rejecters cause Allah's Law to seal their hearts to reason","7:102":"And in most of them We found no bond with their honored stature of humanity (17:70). And We found that most of them slip away from the Permanent Values","7:103":"(Here is another historical account. Moses was the next generation to Shoaib.

Then I will crucify every one of you.\" (Cutting off of the hands and feet on the alternate side refers to immobilization otherwise crucifixion won't be necessary)","7:125":"They responded, \"We are determined to turn to the Way of our Lord","7:126":"Will you persecute us simply because we believed in the Revelations of our Lord when they came to us? Our Lord! Strengthen our resolve and make us die as those who have surrendered to You","7:127":"The chiefs among Pharaoh's people said, \"Will you allow Moses and his people to create disorder in the land, and forsake your rule and your gods?\" He said, \"We will slay their sons and spare their women. We are in power over them","7:128":"Moses assured his people, \"Seek help in Allah and endure. Following the Divine Commands will empower you. The earth belongs to Allah, and not to any tyrants. He grants it to His servants according to His Laws (21:105).

They should have stopped to think","7:131":"(Instead of reflecting and taking corrective action, they sought the easy way out.) All good that came along, they ascribed it to their own worthiness, and any affliction that struck them, they blamed it on the bad omen of Moses and his companions. Most people know not that there is no such thing as a bad omen or a good omen. People determine their destiny according to Allah's Laws. In that sense, then, omens are with Allah alone","7:132":"They kept telling Moses, \"Whatever the Verses might say, whatever bad omens you could bring, or bewitch us with your logic, we will not believe in you\" (and will not consider moral reformation)","7:133":"Their System was too inefficient to fight off natural calamities, such as, floods, swarms of locusts, diseases of crops, livestock and humans. These were open signs for them to wake up to reform, but Pharaoh and his chiefs were too arrogant to accept responsibility, and too involved in luxury to take action. They were guilty of misrule","7:134":"(The irrational Egyptians continued to remain sunken in superstition.) Whenever hardship struck, they turned to Moses for prayer stating that Allah had a pledge with him, and promising that they would believe and let the Children of Israel go with him. (They did not understand that the pledge of Allah with His Messenger was only that of obeying His Commands and His blessings in return. It did not involve any supernatural phenomena such as miracles)","7:135":"When the hardship ran its course according to Our Laws, they would break their promise with Moses","7:136":"They had to meet with Our Law of Requital as they continued to deny Our Revelations and remained heedless. Instead of mending their ways, they tried to annihilate Moses and his people and We drowned them in the sea as they were pursuing Moses and his people, in rage and arrogance","7:137":"We made the oppressed people inherit the east and the west of the land that We had blessed with abundant provision. The Commands of your Lord were fulfilled for the Children of Israel to reward them for their steadfastness. Pharaoh and his people eventually met destruction for violating Our Laws. And We mingled with dust, the great works and fine buildings, temples, palaces, tombs, statues and stately structures of all kinds that Pharaoh and his people had built with so much skill and pride. (The Children of Israel later inherited a sizeable and highly prosperous kingdom including Syria and Palestine under David and Solomon)","7:138":"After they crossed the sea (into Sinai (2:50-51)), the Children of Israel passed by some people who were worshiping statues.

They killed your sons and spared your women. This was a great tribulation you incurred according to the Laws of your Lord, since you had divided among yourselves and became weak","7:142":"We summoned Moses for one month and ten days to instruct him about the future program (2:51). The complete term would take forty nights, in two stages of thirty and ten to make it easy for him. Before leaving for Mount Sinai, Moses assigned his brother Aaron, as his deputy and told him to keep social order after him and not to be intimidated by the problem makers","7:143":"When Moses arrived at the appointed time, and his Lord spoke to him, Moses said, \"My Lord! Show me Yourself, such that I can see You.\" His Lord said, \"You cannot see Me. The best way to see Me is to look at this mountain and think. If you contemplate, you will understand that even a single mountain is made of countless atoms that were scattered. Then consider that you have seen Me.\" Realizing this, Moses imagined the Glory of His Lord through His signs in the Universe. He was stunned and when he recovered his senses, he said, \"Infinite are You in Your Glory! I feel embarrassed and repent at my question. I am among the foremost believers.\" (The 7,359 feet high Mount Sinai is standing to this day. Therefore contrary to popular literal translation of this verse, its understanding in allegorical terms is preferred. Also, a Prophet of God is unlikely to make a demand to behold God in physical form)","7:144":"God said, \"O Moses! I have chosen you to be My Messenger and convey My Word to the people. I have given to you My Messages and spoken to you. Hold on to these Commands and be appreciative by sharing My Bounty of Revelations with people","7:145":"We ordained for him in, the Tablets of Law, Enlightenment and clearly spelled out Guidance.

Even if they went through the entire script, and saw clear evidence of the Truth, their arrogance will keep them from believing. When they see the right guidance, they do not accept it, but they readily accept straying. This is because they choose to preemptively deny Our Revelations and to remain unaware of the wisdom in them. (*The consequences according to the Law of Requital, Allah ascribes to Himself, such as \"Allah did it)","7:147":"Those who deny our Messages and the meeting of the Hereafter, their works are fruitless. Are they rewarded anything but what they deserved for their decisions","7:148":"The people of Moses made up a calf out of their ornaments while Moses was on the Mount Sinai. They made it such that blowing into it produced a lowing sound. They didn't even see that it couldn't talk to them or show them any way. Still they chose it as a god, and thus wronged their own \"Self","7:149":"When they regretted their action and realized that they had gone astray, they said, \"Unless our Lord embraces us with Mercy and forgives us, we surely will be lost","7:150":"Moses returned to his people and was upset and grieved. He said, \"You have chosen a terrible thing after me. Do you wish your Lord's Law of Requital to smite you soon (20:86)? He placed the tablets of the Commands among them and questioned his brother, Aaron, very strictly. Aaron explained, \"O Son of my mother! These people treated me harshly and took my patience as weakness, and almost killed me. Let not my opponents rejoice, and count me not among the wrongdoers.\" (Seizing the beard and head is indicative of interrogating harshly. Aaron had been extra patient with their idolatry to avoid division among them (20:94). Aaron, the Prophet of God, preferred SHIRK over Sectarianism. This is how reprehensible sectarianism and division in religion is","7:151":"Moses said, \"My Lord! Forgive me, and my brother and admit us in Your Grace. You are the Most Merciful among the gracious","7:152":"Those who chose the calf for worship, have incurred their Lord's Requital, and humiliation in the life of this world. Thus do We requite those who invent a lie","7:153":"Those who have done ill deeds, but then repent and attain belief, for them, afterward, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","7:154":"When Moses calmed down, he picked up the tablets, on which was inscribed Merciful Guidance for those who fear violating the Law of their Lord","7:155":"Moses planned for the future. He appointed seventy of his people as officers to prevent the nation from wavering. An earthquake shook them (2:55) and Moses said, \"My Lord! You could have destroyed them and me before, if You so willed (when they asked to see God in physical form (2:55)). Would you destroy us for the actions of the ignorant among us? This must be Your trial for us. You have appointed Laws of straying and guidance. You are our Protecting Friend. Forgive us and have Mercy on us. You are the Best of forgivers","7:156":"Ordain for us the good in this world and in the Hereafter. We turn to You with conviction in Your Guidance.\" God responded, \"My punishment is but the Law of Requital, and My Mercy embraces all things. I will specify My Mercy to those who walk aright, spend their wealth on community welfare, and practically believe in Our Revelations","7:157":"(Now the Law has been revealed to Prophet Muhammad.) Follow the Messenger, the Prophet who is a non-Israelite, and who was unlettered before the Revelation (29:48). They find him well described* in the Torah and the Gospel with them. He enjoins upon them the Right, and forbids them the Wrong. He declares Lawful all good things, and declares Unlawful only the unclean things. He relieves people from the burdens they carried. He breaks the shackles that they used to wear, of mental and physical slavery, and brings them from darkness to Light (5:15-16), (65:11), (76:4). Those who believe in him, honor him, support him, and follow the Light that came with him, are the eternally successful. *(Deuteronomy xviii, 15 and 18. Gospel of John 14:16, 15:26, 16:7 PARACLETOS = COMFORTER, from original Greek PERICLYTOS = THE PRAISED ONE. In Aramaic, MAWHAMANA = THE PRAISED ONE)","7:158":"Say, \"O Mankind! I am Allah's Messenger to all of you (beyond temporal and geographical bounds). The Messenger of Him to Whom belongs the Dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He. He has Absolute Control over the fountain spring of life and over the Laws of transition to death. So, believe in Allah and His Messenger, the Prophet to whose people no Scripture was given before, and who believes in Allah and in His Words. Follow him so that you may be rightly guided","7:159":"The people of Moses were given similar guidance and a section among them was guided and did justice in Truth","7:160":"We set up twelve tribal communities among the Israelites for effective administration. When his people asked for water, We revealed to Moses, \"Strike the rock with your staff!\" And twelve springs gushed forth from there. (Remember the times when you were in the Sinai desert and there was shortage of water. Moses asked for water for his people and We guided him to a rock under which were hidden twelve springs of water ready to gush forth. Moses, with the strength of his conviction and with the help of his companions, unclogged those springs and each of the twelve tribes found their respective source of fresh cool water (2:60)). Moses had established the Divine system of life. We shall open the Blessings of the heavens and the earth for any nation that accepts these Laws and works for the collective good of humanity. Such abundance with equity is no less than a heavenly \"Table spread\" that ensures freedom from want for all, in the shadow of Divine Grace. They enjoyed delicious bird meat and vegetation they had grown in the oasis of their own making. That is what the people of Moses were given, \"Eat of the good things that We have provided you.\" After a time, the corrupters in that wonderful society started dissenting. Did they harm us? Nay, they harmed their own \"Self","7:161":"And remember, when it was said to them, \"Dwell in this town, enjoy Our bounties all along and remain humble before Our Commands. As soon as you enter the gate, your wandering in the desert will end. Remain submissive and We will forgive your faults. We increase the reward for those who benefit humanity.\" (2:58). Then We commanded you, \"Enter the Sacred Land (of Palestine (5:21)) and enjoy the provisions; eat from where you want. Enter the gate humbly and say, HITTATUN, 'Our Lord! Absolve our misdeeds, we mend our ways.' Then do what you say and We shall forgive you your misdeeds and amply reward the doers of good","7:162":"But, some of the wrongdoers began changing the Word of God that was taught to them, and displaced it with their own fabrications. And that resulted in a change in behavior. Our Heavenly Law of Requital caused them to weaken and waver, for they violated the Commands (2:59-61). Detachment from the Ideology made them lose their strength","7:163":"Ask the Israelites about the township (Elat) that was located by the sea, and they had violated the Sabbath. The big fish used to come on the surface in abundance on their day of Sabbath, feeling secure, and did not come up on other days. (But the community failed to persevere, and broke the Sabbath to get a good catch). Thus We tested them to see for themselves how they drift away from discipline","7:164":"The kind-hearted among them kept reminding the violators. And others said, \"Why do you preach a people whom Allah's Requital is going to destroy or punish them with a severe torment?\" The counselors said, \"In order to be free of guilt before your Lord that we failed to advise. And in the hope that they walk aright","7:165":"When they disregarded the reminders, We saved the ones who admonished them. And punished those who transgressed and drifted away from the Command","7:166":"As they persisted with their rebellious behavior, Our Law caused their disposition take a downward turn and they developed apish mentality. We told them, \"Be the living symbols of humiliation","7:167":"And remember, your Lord proclaimed that He would raise against them till the Day of Resurrection, people who will persecute them. Your Lord is Swift in Retribution, yet any peoples who mend their ways, will find Him Forgiving, Merciful","7:168":"Our Law caused them to scatter in the earth as sections. Among them some are righteous, and some are opposite. Through the turns of history We have caused them to experience easy and difficult times, in order that they might return to Our Laws","7:169":"But, the succeeding generations that inherited the Scripture, did no better. They became more materialistic, falling for instant gains. Yet, they insist, \"We will be forgiven,\" and won't have to account for it. And they keep longing for material gains. Didn't they promise to uphold the Scripture, and not to say about God but the Truth? And they have studied the Commands in it! The long-term benefit and the abode of the Hereafter are better for those who deal justly with people and walk aright. Do you not use sense","7:170":"Those who hold fast to the Book of Allah, and strive to establish the Divine System, should know that We never squander the reward of the righteous","7:171":"They must recall that the Mount Sinai stands over them as a telling Witness. The mountain could shake with a quake and fall to be level with them but the Divine Guidance is the unwavering Truth (13:31), (59:61). We said, \"Hold fast the Scripture We have given you and work the teachings in it, so that you may live upright","7:172":"Your Lord brought forth generations from the Children of Adam, and they have been the living testimony that He creates and provides them with sustenance. \"Am I not your Sustainer?\" They practically admit, \"Yes, verily. We testify.\" Thus you cannot say on the Resurrection Day, \"We were not aware of this","7:173":"Nor will any excuse avail them such as, \"It was our forefathers who took false gods and we inherited their belief system. Will you punish us for what falsehood others practiced?\" (You will not be questioned what others used to do. No one will bear the load of another (2)","7:174":"We explain Our Verses in detail so that people turn towards the Book","7:175":"And tell them what happens to him whom We have conveyed Our Messages and he passes them by. So his selfish desire overtakes him, and he becomes of those who lose their way","7:176":"He could have raised himself in honor according to Our Laws, but he clung to the earth and followed his own desire. Therefore his likeness is as the likeness of a dog. Whether you pet him or scold him, he pants. Such is the example of people who deny Our Revelations in practice. (The Revelation of Allah lightens your burdens, while man-made dogmas burden you (7:157)). So relate this narration that they may reflect","7:177":"Indeed, pitiable is the example of those who reject Our Verses, since they hurt their own \"Self","7:178":"Whoever attains Allah's Guidance according to His Laws is led aright. And goes astray he who violates Allah's Law of Guidance","7:179":"Our Law has committed to Hell numerous people, rural and urban; they are living the life of hell. They have hearts that they use not to understand. They have eyes with which they see not, and ears with which they hear not. They are like cattle. Nay, they are even worse. Such are the people who have chosen to live through life in total darkness of ignorance","7:180":"All Names of Allah are the fairest names. You can invoke Him by any of them. Be mindful not to over-emphasize a single attribute of His. (For example, the Merciful God is also a Just God). Disregard those who distort His Names or the meaning of His Attributes (like calling Him, father, son, the man upstairs, the destroyer etc.) Be assured that all of you will be rewarded according to your doings, and by no other criterion","7:181":"Among the communities We have created there have been those who guide with Truth and establish justice with it","7:182":"And those who deny Our Revelations, Our Law of Requital leads them in stages to the miserable destination they have no idea of","7:183":"I give them respite but My Law of Requital is designed to be strong","7:184":"Has it never occurred to them that there is no madness whatever in their fellow-man? He has lived a whole life among you (10:16). He is only a plain Warner","7:185":"Can they not see (and correlate what he tells them with) the Dominion of the heavens and the earth and what Allah has created? Does it ever occur to them that the end of their own life may be near (hence the time to make the right decisions is not unlimited)? What HADITH besides the Qur'an, are they going to believe after him","7:186":"There is no guide for him who misleads himself by violating Allah's Law of Guidance. When he leaves the Law, the Law leaves him wandering in the wilderness of arrogant trespassing","7:187":"(They even venture into predicting the end of the world.) They ask you (O Messenger), about the Hour, when the end of the world will come to pass. Say, \"That knowledge is only with my Lord. He alone will manifest it at the appropriate time. Heavy it is in the heavens and the earth. It will come upon you suddenly.\" They ask you as if you could gain insight into this mystery with persistent inquiry. Say, \"The knowledge thereof is with Allah only. But most people do not know that even Messengers were not given this knowledge","7:188":"Say, \"I do not even have the power to benefit myself or to avert harm to myself, contrary to the Laws of Allah. Had I the knowledge of what is beyond the reach of human perception, I would have amassed abundant fortune, and no adversity would ever touch me. I am but a Warner and a bearer of good news for those who believe in the Message","7:189":"(The Message encompasses life in its totality.) Recall that Allah created life from a single life cell, then made male and female cells, and then shaped you into human beings, males and females. He designed it such that man might incline with love towards the woman. When he gets intimate with her, she carries a light load that she can hardly notice. As she grows heavy with the child, they both implore Allah, their Lord, \"If you indeed grant us a healthy baby, we shall certainly be among the grateful","7:190":"But as soon as He grants them a sound baby, they begin to ascribe to other powers beside Him a share in bringing about what He has granted them. Exalted is He, High Above all that they associate with Him","7:191":"Do they ascribe to Him as partners things that can create nothing, but are themselves created","7:192":"And they cannot help them, nor can they help themselves","7:193":"When you invite them to the Guidance, they follow you not. It is the same for you whether you invite them or remain silent","7:194":"Those whom you call upon besides Allah, such as mystics and saints, are people like you. Go ahead and call upon them, let them respond by helping you if you are true in your belief","7:195":"Do the idols have feet to walk, hands to hold, eyes to see and ears to hear?

They do their best and then put their trust in their Lord","8:3":"They help establish the Divine System and keep the provision that We have given them, open for the good of humanity","8:4":"Such are the true believers. They have high ranks with their Lord and for them is the security of forgiveness and honorable provision","8:5":"(When the time came to defend the Ideological State of Madinah), your Lord commanded you (O Prophet) to go forth from your home with the conviction that the Truth was on your side. And some of the believers were reluctant","8:6":"(They argued whether to meet the aggressor outside Madinah at Badr, or wait.) And they disputed with you about it after the decision had been made manifest in mutual consultations, as if they were being driven to obvious death","8:7":"Allah promised you engagement and victory against one of the two groups. You preferred to face the weaker group, but Allah willed the Truth to prevail according to His Words and soundly defeat the aggressive disbelievers","8:8":"(That was your first armed confrontation with the opponents in which you were greatly outnumbered and ill equipped.)

Victory is achieved only according to the Laws of Allah. He is Powerful, Wise.

That He might refresh you and free you from the fear of the satanic act of the enemy (as they confiscated the water wells). Thus He strengthened your hearts and made firm your foothold","8:12":"This is how your Lord inspired the angels, \"I am with you. So make the believers stand firm.

Whatever you take as spoils of war, a fifth of that is for Allah and for the Messenger (the Central Authority, to run the government). The rest will belong to the families of soldiers who laid their lives defending the State, the orphans, those left alone in the society, the widows, the ones whose income has stalled for any reason, the needy wayfarer, and whoever travels to the believers in a destitute condition.

Inspire the believers to conquer all fear of death when fighting in the Cause of Allah. So that if there be twenty of you who are patient in adversity, they might overcome two hundred; and if there be one hundred of you, they might overcome one thousand of those who are bent upon denying the Truth.

And so, if there be one hundred of you who are steadfast in adversity, they should be able to overcome two hundred; and if there be one thousand of you, they should be able to overcome two thousand by Allah's Leave. For, Allah is with those who are steadfast in adversity","8:67":"It is beyond the dignity of a Prophet that he may hold any captives, except temporarily, during warfare.

For those who believed but stayed back (in Makkah), you don't owe them support until they migrate. However, if they seek your help as sisters and brothers in DEEN (Divine Ideology), then it is your duty to help them except against a folk with whom you have a treaty.

If you do not help the immigrants, there will be chaos in the land and great corruption","8:74":"Those who believed and emigrated, and strove in the Cause of Allah, and those who hosted them and supported them, are True believers. For them is protection of forgiveness and honorable provision","8:75":"And those who followed them in belief, and left their homes, and strove along with you, they are of you.

They are the ones given to excesses","9:11":"If they mend their ways, and as law-abiding citizens, help consolidate the Divine System, and the Just Economic Order of Zakat, then they are your brothers in the System of life. We explain Our Revelations for those who wish to learn. (The usual translation of this verse conveys the meaning that if they start praying five times a day and give 2.5% poor-due per year, then they are your brothers in religion. This interpretation goes directly against the all-encompassing Ordinance of Allah that there is no compulsion or coercion in DEEN Islam)","9:12":"If they keep breaking their pledges after their treaty, and assail your System, then fight the chiefs of the disbelievers. They have no respect for their binding oaths. This action will help restrain them from aggression","9:13":"Will you not fight a folk who keep breaking their solemn pledges and did everything to drive out the Messenger, and did attack you first? What! Do you fear them? Nay, it is Allah alone Whom you should more justly fear, if you are truly believers","9:14":"Fight them!

In return, the State will guarantee them internal and external security, and equal rights of citizenship. JIZYA will always be less than Zakat, and will be payable only by the able-bodied Non-Muslim citizens of the State. In addition, these able-bodied citizens would be exempt from compulsory military service)","9:30":"The Jews say, \"Uzayr is God's son,\" while the Christians say, \"The Messiah is God's son.\" They only utter baseless themes with their mouths, following in spirit assertions made in earlier times by people (like the Greeks and Zoroastrians) who denied the Truth! Allah condemns them. They are surely deluded.

And they take as their Lord, the Messiah son of Mary. Yet they were commanded to worship but One God. There is no god but He. Praise and Glory to Him, He is far too Glorious for what they ascribe to Him. (*Talmud shows the Jewish superstition of ascribing divinity to Ezra, rabbis, saints, doctors of law and learned men. And the doctrine of Papal infallibility, divinity of saints and praying to them are common in the Roman Catholic Church)","9:32":"They seek to extinguish Allah's Light (the Qur'an) by their utterances (61:8).

This has been Allah's Ordinance since the day He created the heavens and the earth. Four of these Months are Sacred, forbidden for all warfare. (Mankind, through international treaties, must agree to shun all kind of warfare during these four months. This will give them a cooling off period that sense may prevail over emotions). This is the Firm Religion, the right way. So, do not wrong yourselves by fighting during the Sacred Months. However, you may fight the idolaters in any or all these months if they fight against you in any or all of them (2:194). And know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.

What is amiss with you that, when called upon, \"Go forth in the Cause of Allah,\" you cling heavily to the ground? Do you choose pleasure in the life of this world rather than in the life to come?

When the disbelievers drove him out of his home, they were just two men. They had to seek refuge in a cave. The Messenger said to his companion, \"Grieve not. Surely, Allah is with us.\" Then Allah sent His reassuring peace upon him, and supported him with invisible forces of faith and courage (9:26). He made the word of the disbelievers utterly low.

This is best for you if you but knew","9:42":"There are people among you that if it were a quick material gain and a short easy journey, they would follow you. But the strife and the distance seem heavy and long to them. They will swear by Allah, \"If we could, we would have gone along with you.\" They destroy their \"Self\".

Tell them, \"Your contribution is not accepted whether you pay willingly or unwillingly. You are a people who drift away from the System at the first opportune time","9:54":"What prevents their contributions from being accepted is this: They do not truly believe in Allah and His Messenger.

Those who are not able to earn enough living to meet their basic needs, for any reason. Those whose running businesses have stalled or the ones who have lost their jobs, who have become needy with their active lives coming to a standstill. Officers who have been appointed by the government to collect alms and charity. Those who are hindered from joining the Divine System for financial reasons. To free men and women from bondage of any kind: physical slavery, unjust captivity, and oppression from any quarters. Those pressed under the load of ransom or heavy debt from an enemy.

And they could find no fault in the Divine System except that Allah has enriched them and caused His Messenger to enrich them out of His Bounty.

He has Supreme Control over the origination of life which began in water (21:30). Life is a test for yourselves to see which of you leads a balanced life and is best in conduct. Yet, if you (O Prophet), say, \"You will be raised again after death,\" the rejecters of the Truth will surely answer, \"This is clearly nothing but a fabulous delusion","11:8":"And when We delay for them the retribution until after the Period of Respite, they will surely say, \"What is keeping back the doom?\" Ah! On the day it actually reaches them, nothing will turn it away from them. And their mockery will completely surround them","11:9":"(Those who only believe in the instant gains of this life, are quick to rejoice and quick to despair.) If Our Law causes man to taste Mercy from Us and afterward withdraws it from him, he behaves despairing, thankless","11:10":"And if Our Law causes him to taste Blessing after some hardship has visited him, he says, \"Gone is all affliction from me!\" Behold! He falls into exultation and pride","11:11":"But those who are steadfast in adversity and prosperity, and work to improve the quality of life for all, behave positively. For them is the protection of forgiveness and a great reward","11:12":"Is it then conceivable (O Prophet), that you omit any part of what is being revealed to you (because the rejecters dislike it)? Or because you feel uncomfortable on their saying, \"Why has not a treasure been sent down for him, or an angel come with him?\" You are but a Warner, and it is Allah Who is the Custodian of all things","11:13":"Or they assert, \"He has invented it.\" Say to them, \"Then bring a portion of Surahs like this, invented, and call on everyone you can besides Allah, if you are truthful!\" (Or produce one Surah like this (2)","11:14":"And if they answer not your prayer, then know that it has been revealed only in the Knowledge of Allah; and that there is no god but He. Will you then surrender yourselves unto Him","11:15":"Whoever cares for (no more than) the short term gains and glitter of the worldly life, We shall repay for them their deeds herein without the least reduction","11:16":"But (since they did not invest in the life to come), for them is nothing but Fire in the Hereafter. All that they have contrived here is vain, and worthless is all that they did. (Following ones own desires is the inevitable consequence of disregarding the Divine Values)","11:17":"Contrary to such people is the one who has truly seen his Lord's Signs in the Universe. Now he has the Prophet as a witness, who correlates Allah's Signs in the Universe with His Messages. And before this, the Scripture of Moses has set a precedent and graceful guidance. (It foretold the advent of the final Messenger; Deuteronomy 18:15-18). Such people will surely attain belief. As for those who league together in rejection of such obvious Truth, the Fire is their appointed place. Harbor not any doubt; verily this is the Truth from your Sustainer. But the majority of mankind do not believe","11:18":"Who can be a greater wrongdoer than the one who invents a lie about Allah? (The clergy have always done it with previous Scriptures, and they will do it again (2:79), (3:77), (6:113), (6:138-139), (9:34), (22:52)). Such will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, \"These are they who lied about their Sustainer.\" Oh, verily, Allah's rejection is the due of all those who displace right with wrong","11:19":"They are the ones who hinder people from the Path of Allah, and seek to make it crooked. Thus they practically disbelieve in the life Hereafter","11:20":"They cannot escape Allah's Law of Requital even if they run to and fro in the earth, unscathed. Never will they find anyone to protect them from Allah. Double suffering will be imposed on them since they could not bear to hear the Truth nor could see it","11:21":"Such are those who have lost their \"Self\", and all their false imagery, their invented dogmas and idols will leave them in the lurch","11:22":"These fabricators will be the worst losers in the Hereafter","11:23":"Those who attain belief and work for the betterment of people, and are humble before their Lord, are the rightful dwellers of the Garden; they will abide therein","11:24":"These two kinds of people may be likened to the blind and deaf of reason, and the seeing and hearing. Can these two be deemed alike? Will you not then keep this in mind?

And we see not that any follow you but the obviously lowest caste among us. (17:70). We do not see that you people are in any way superior to us, such as, wealth and property. Nay, we deem all of you liars","11:28":"Noah said, \"O My people! Bethink! What if I am taking my stand on clear evidence from my Lord? What if He has blessed me out of His Grace of guidance? It is obscure to you because you are not seeing it through the eyes of reason. In any case, can we compel you to accept what you don't like","11:29":"O My people! No benefit do I ask you for this. My reward rests with none but Allah. And I am not going to repulse any of the believers (39:40), (63:8). Verily, they know that they are destined to meet their Lord, whereas in you I see people who are wandering in the darkness of ignorance","11:30":"And O My people! Who will help me against Allah if I drove them away? Will you then not reflect","11:31":"I never say to you that I have the Treasures of Allah. Neither do I claim knowledge of what is beyond human perception, nor do I say that I am an angel. I disagree with you, that my followers are the folk of the lesser status. You claim that Allah will never give them His Bounties, but He knows their true merit. I cannot be unjust to them","11:32":"They said, \"O Noah! You have disputed with us and disputed a great deal. Now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are a man of truth","11:33":"He answered, \"Only Allah brings His Requital according to His Law, once it is upon you, then you can by no means escape","11:34":"Noah said, \"My counseling and well-wishing will not help you outside of Allah's Law of Guidance and straying (4:88). He is your Lord, and unto Him you must return along with your deeds","11:35":"God said to Noah, \"Do they say that you have invented this set of values?\" \"Tell them, if I made it up, I am responsible for my crime. And I am innocent of your crimes.\" (Let them at least reflect if they are doing wrong or not)","11:36":"And it was revealed to Noah, \"No one of your folk will attain faith except the ones who have believed already. So grieve no longer over their actions","11:37":"We commanded Noah, \"But build an ark under Our Eyes and according to Our Directions, and do not plead with Me on behalf of the oppressors. (23:27). Behold, they are destined to be drowned.\" (A flood in the valley of Tigris and Euphrates was forthcoming. (11:44). The rejecters would drown for not following the Prophet","11:38":"As he was building the ship, and every time the chiefs of his nation passed by him, they mocked at him. Thereupon he said, \"If you are mocking us, behold, we are mocking (at your ignorance) just as you are mocking us","11:39":"And soon you will know upon whom a humiliating punishment befalls, and upon whom a lasting torment will come","11:40":"Thus it was until Our Command came to pass. Water gushed forth in torrents over the face of the land. Torrential rain began and the rivers started over flowing. We commanded Noah to take with him livestock, a couple each, and to take his family and followers with him. The rejecters, of course, were not to embark (Noah's son and wife (11:45), (66:10) did not embark). The community of believers with Noah was small","11:41":"Noah put his trust in Allah and told his people to embark, \"Come on board, in the name of Allah will be its course and its resting. My Lord is the Provider of shelter, Merciful","11:42":"The ship sailed with them amidst huge waves as Noah called his son, who was standing aloof, \"O My dear son! Come ride with us; do not be with the disbelievers","11:43":"He said. \"I will cling to a hill-top to protect me from the water.\" Noah said, \"Nothing can protect anyone today from God's Command except for those who have earned His Grace.\" (The only security that day in the valley was for those who had believed in Noah, followed his advice and thus attained God's Mercy). A towering wave came between them and his son was among those who drowned","11:44":"And it was said, \"O Earth! Swallow your water and, O Sky! Cease!\" And the command was fulfilled. The water sank into the earth. And the ark came to rest upon the Mount","11:45":"Noah called upon his Lord, \"My Lord! My son was of my family and Your Promise is the True Promise and You are the Most Just of judges.\" (So, why was he not saved? Didn't You promise to save my family)","11:46":"His Lord said, \"O Noah! Your son was not of your family. His conduct was not righteous. You were not aware of the Divine Criterion of relationships which are based on Ideology and not on lineage otherwise you wouldn't have asked such a question. I enlighten you so that you don't remain ignorant in this regard","11:47":"Noah said, \"My Lord! I guard myself in Your shelter from asking favors which do not befit me, and for my lack of knowledge. Forgive me and shower me with Your Grace, otherwise I will become a loser","11:48":"He was told, \"O Noah! Disembark and descend from the hills in Peace from Us, and there are the blessings of decent sustenance for you and your companions (in spite of the recent flood (11:41)). And other nations, all of them will be awarded according to their deeds. Those who care only for the ornament of this life will be provided for in the world, but eventually suffer from Our Law of Requital","11:49":"(O Prophet) These are the news We reveal to you that neither you, nor your people were aware of. Go ahead with your program with forbearance. The destination of Bliss belongs to those who journey through life upright","11:50":"We sent to Aad their brother Hud. He said, \"O My people! Serve Allah alone. You have no god but He. As it is, you are but inventors of falsehood","11:51":"He said, \"O My people! I ask no reward from you. My reward is with Him Who brought me into being.

He will shower upon you heavenly blessings abundant, and add strength to your strength. Do not turn away, guilty","11:53":"They said, \"O Hud! You have not shown us any miracle. We will not forsake our idols just because you say so. We are not going to believe you","11:54":"We think that one of our gods has possessed you like a demon and you have gone crazy.\" Hud said, \"I call Allah to witness, and you too bear witness that I am absolutely free of your idolatry","11:55":"Get together, all of you and your gods besides Him. Make a firm decision against me and give me no respite","11:56":"I have put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is not a creature in the Universe beyond His firm Control. Behold, my Lord is on the Straight Path","11:57":"You may accept or reject the Message that I have clearly conveyed to you. If you turn away, you will decline and fall. Then, My Lord will bring another nation in your place. You cannot harm Him at all. Verily, My Lord is He Who is the Guardian of all things","11:58":"And so, when Our Command came to pass, We saved Hud and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us. We saved them from a harsh retribution that inflicted the rejecters","11:59":"Such were Aad. They denied the clear Messages of their Lord, rebelled against His Messengers and followed the command of every stubborn tyrant","11:60":"And they were pursued in this world by Divine rejection, and will be overtaken by it on the Resurrection Day. Oh, verily, Aad denied their Sustainer! Oh, away with the Aad, the people of Hud","11:61":"And to the nation of Thamud, We sent their brother Saleh. He said, \"O My people! Serve Allah. You have no one worthy of obedience but He. He initiated you from the earth and made you thrive thereon. Come to His forgiveness, then turn to Him in repentance mending your ways. My Lord is ever-Near, Responsive","11:62":"They said, \"O Saleh! Great hopes We had placed in you before this! But now you are telling us to move away from worshiping what our forefathers worshiped. Verily, now we are in grave doubt, amounting to suspicion about the meaning of your call to us","11:63":"He said, \"O My people! Do you really think? If I have clear evidence of the Truth from my Lord, and there has come to me a mercy from Him, who can help me against Allah if I disobey Him? (If I get intimidated), you can only push me into ruin","11:64":"(The feudal lords had been depriving the poor of using the land and its natural resources of water and vegetation.) Saleh said, \"O My people! This she-camel belonging to Allah shall be a token for you. So leave her alone to graze in the land belonging to Allah. Do her no harm, lest speedy punishment befall you (91:13).\" (This verse along with (55:10) pronounces one of the most revolutionary concepts of the Qur'an. The land, the earth is owned by none but Allah and must be open for all His creation as a means of sustenance. Hence, all landlord-ship is contrary to the Divine Ordinance. In the Divine System, the Central Authority will see to it that any piece of land will be for those who toil in it and give Allah His Right, the poor-due","11:65":"But they cruelly slaughtered her. Thereupon He said to his people, \"Only for three more days shall you enjoy life in your homes.

But they said, \"Fear not! Behold, we are sent to the people of Lot.\" (Abraham was apprehensive thinking the visitors refusing hospitality might have aggressive intentions, but in fact they were hurrying to Lot)","11:71":"And his wife (Sarah), standing nearby, laughed when We gave her good tiding of Isaac, and after Isaac, (his son) Jacob","11:72":"She exclaimed, \"Oh, woe is me! Shall I bear a child, now that I am an old woman and this husband of mine is an old man? This is really strange","11:73":"Answered the Messengers, \"Do you wonder about Allah's Command? May Allah's Grace and Blessings be upon you, O dwellers of the house! Verily the Owner of all Praise, Sublime is He","11:74":"When the fear had left Abraham, and the good news was conveyed to him, he began to plead with Us for Lot's people","11:75":"For, Abraham was clement, kind-hearted, ever turning to His Lord","11:76":"(It was said) O Abraham!

Lot said, \"O My people! Your wives, who are like my daughters, are permitted for you. Be mindful of Allah's Laws, and do not humiliate me in the presence of my guests. Is there not a single upright man among you?\" (Genesis 19:14 states that Lot offered them his own married daughters. Two daughters and the whole crowd!

And, you know well what we want.\" (Our intention is to get our behavior into the realm of the Permissible)","11:80":"Lot exclaimed, \"I wish I had the strength to resist you or had some strong support among you","11:81":"The visiting Messengers said, \"O Lot! Behold, we are Messengers of your Lord. Never shall they follow your guidance nor shall be able to catch up to you. Depart then, with your household and followers, while it is yet night. Leave this land never to look back again. Except your wife for, what befalls the people will befall her as well. Their appointed time is the morning, and isn't the morning near?

She said, \"What should be the punishment for one who wanted to molest your wife, prison or some chastisement of pain","12:26":"Joseph said, \"She is the one who tried to seduce me.\" Now a member of her family came and suggested, \"If his shirt is torn from the front, then she is telling the truth, and he is the liar","12:27":"And if his shirt is torn from the back then she lied, and he is telling the truth","12:28":"When her husband saw the shirt torn from the back, he said, \"This is the typical scheme of you women. Your scheming is formidable.\" (His discriminatory comment shows his anger, and that women in that society were not viewed well)","12:29":"He said, \"O Joseph! Forget about what happened. And you O woman! Ask forgiveness. For, you have been greatly at fault","12:30":"Women in the city started gossiping, \"The governor's wife is trying to seduce her servant. She is deeply in love with him. But we see that she adopted the wrong tactics","12:31":"When she heard their gossip, she invited them, and prepared comfortable couches for them, and they schemed. She gave a knife to each of the women. Then, she called Joseph, \"Come out unto them!\" And when they saw him they flattered him and 'cut their hands'. They exclaimed in their flattery, \"Good Lord! This is no mortal man! This is but an angel!\" (The governor's wife and her friends had planned to incriminate Joseph, and they were just buying time. They made marks on their hands to feign self-defense. There is absolutely no mention of the supposed \"beauty' of Joseph, a fabrication adopted by most commentators from the Bible! Secondly, the root word QAT'A in this verse is of very special significance. Did these women chop off their hands? Must the thieves get their hands chopped off? Please see)","12:32":"The lady of the house said, \"This is he about whom you blamed me. I tried to seduce him but he preserved himself. Since he thinks he is an angel, and remains adamant against my command, he shall be imprisoned and brought low. (And, now we have the evidence against him with marks on your hands. We will humiliate him)","12:33":"Joseph said, \"O My Lord! Prison is dearer to me than these women's schemes. If you did not help me fend off their design, I am afraid of their intimidation, and of behaving like the unguided","12:34":"His Lord heard his prayer, and helped Joseph remain steadfast in fending off their schemes. Verily, He is the Hearer, the Knower of all intentions and actions","12:35":"(The women brought a suit against him.) The judges after seeing the marks on their hands put him in prison for a time","12:36":"Two young men went to prison with him (for unrelated crimes). One of them (a butler) told his dream, \"I saw myself making wine.\" The other (a baker) said, \"I saw myself carrying bread on my head from which birds were eating. Can you tell us what this means? We see that you are a doer of good","12:37":"He said, \"I will tell you the meaning before today's meal is served. But, remember, that it is my Lord Who teaches me through Revelation. I am not one of those who reject Allah's Laws and disbelieve in the accountability of the life to come","12:38":"I follow the creed of such ancestors as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is not conceivable that we ever ascribe partners to Allah. This belief in the Oneness of God is of the Bounty of Allah upon us and upon all mankind. (It frees them from bondage to superstition and to 'men of religion'). But the majority of people fail to grasp this point, and thus remain thankless","12:39":"O My prison mates! Are several masters better, or Allah, the One, the Dominant","12:40":"Those whom you worship and obey besides Him, are but names that you have named, you and your forefathers. Allah has revealed no authority for them. All ruling belongs to Allah alone. And there is no Judge but He. He has commanded that you serve none but Him. That is the Right Religion. But most people are not aware of this fact or disregard it in practice","12:41":"O My prison mates! The first of you will be (restored as) the chief wine butler for the King. The other one (the chief baker of the King) will be crucified and birds will eat off his head. Thus is the case decided about what you ask","12:42":"Joseph asked the one whom he thought would be released, \"Mention me in the presence of your King.\" But, his selfish ways made him ignore to mention it to the King, so Joseph stayed in prison for a few years","12:43":"And one day the King of Egypt said to his court, \"I have dreamed seven fat cows being eaten up by seven lean cows and seven green spikes of wheat and (seven) dry. O My chiefs! Explain to me my vision, if you can interpret dreams","12:44":"They answered, \"Confused nightmares! We are not skilled in interpreting such dreams","12:45":"The one who was released (the chief butler) at long last remembered. He said, \"I can bring you the meaning, so send me forth","12:46":"He said, \"Joseph! O you truthful one! Explain for us the seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean ones, and the seven green spikes of wheat and others dry. I wish to go back with information that they may know\" (the interpretation and your value)","12:47":"Joseph (without blaming him for his forgetfulness) told him the meaning and the way to avert the oncoming famine, \"Work hard on agriculture for seven seasons. When you harvest the crop, only reap the amount you need. Leave the rest of the grains in the spikes","12:48":"Then after that will come seven dry seasons which will use up all that you have prepared for them, but a little that you have stored up","12:49":"After that, one year will come with good rains and the crops will be plenty. You will get abundant grain and fruit, and a lot of oil and juice to squeeze","12:50":"And the King said, \"Bring him before me!\" When the courier came to Joseph, he said, \"Return to your King and ask him to find out the case of the women who marked their hands. Verily, my Lord knows their plot.\" (Joseph asked for investigation before being released, to vindicate his character)","12:51":"The King sent for those women, and asked them, \"What happened when you tried to seduce Joseph?\" They answered, \"Good Lord! We found no evil in him.\" The wife of the governor (Zelicha) couldn't hold back, \"Now the truth is out. I was the one at fault and he is surely truthful","12:52":"(When Joseph learned this) He said, \"I hope that the governor will realize that I never betrayed him in his absence. And Allah never leads to success those who betray Him and betray the trust of people","12:53":"I do not claim that I am angelic, with no ego or desire. The human \"Self\" is not invincible against temptation (unless we make it surrender to the Divine Commands). It is my Lord's Mercy that mankind are in control of their behavior. Verily, my Lord is Absolver of imperfections, Merciful","12:54":"The King said, \"Bring him to me so that I may appoint him a close adviser to me.\" And when he had spoken with him, the King decreed, \"From today on you have a high standing with us, invested with all trust","12:55":"Joseph replied, \"Place in my charge the treasury of the State. I shall be a competent custodian.\" (Now that he could personally handle the oncoming drought)","12:56":"Thus, We gave established power to Joseph in the land (of Egypt). He had full mastery over it, ruling as he saw fit. We bestow Our Grace according to Our Laws, and never waste the reward of the doers of good","12:57":"And the reward in the life to come is phenomenally better for all those who attain belief and walk aright","12:58":"(And after some years) Joseph's brothers came and presented themselves before him. Joseph recognized them, but they did not. (They came from Canaan to buy grain as places around Egypt started suffering the drought)","12:59":"And when he had given them suitable provisions, he said, \"Next time bring to me that brother of yours from your father's side. Now you have seen that I am just and hospitable","12:60":"And if you don't bring him to me, you will get no share from me; you will not even come close","12:61":"They said, \"We shall try to persuade his father to let him go; that we will surely do","12:62":"Joseph said to his servants, \"Load their barter (the price of wheat) back in their saddlebags. So that they may find it when they come home, and hence be more eager to return","12:63":"When they went back to their father, they said, \"O Our father! All grain is to be withheld from us unless you send with us our brother (Benjamin). So send him that we may obtain the measure, surely, we shall guard him well","12:64":"Jacob said, \"Shall I trust you with him as I trusted you with his brother? Allah is better at Guarding and He is the most Merciful of the merciful","12:65":"When they opened their packs, they discovered that their barter had been returned to them. (The grand minister, the Prophet of God, had paid on their behalf). They said, \"O Our father! What more can we ask? We shall bring food for our family and guard our brother. And we shall have the extra measure of a camel load. The first load we have brought is but scant","12:66":"Jacob said, \"I will not send him with you till you give me a solemn pledge in the name of Allah, that you will bring him back to me unless you get surrounded (by circumstances beyond control). And when they gave him their solemn pledge, he said, \"Allah is the Warden over all we say","12:67":"And he said, \"O My sons! Do not enter the town all by one gate, but enter by different gates. Yet, I cannot avail you against the Divine Laws. (So, handle all situations accordingly). Rule and Law-giving belongs to Allah alone. In Him I trust, and everyone must place trust in Him since the Divine Laws never change.\" (17:77), (33:38), (35:43). (It is a common misconception that Jacob told his eleven sons to enter by different gates to obviate 'evil eye'. Historically the brothers had been accused of spying on a previous occasion. The Qur'an consistently rejects all superstition)","12:68":"When they went, they entered the town as their father instructed. Jacob was quite right that even he (a Prophet of God) could not avail them against the Divine Laws. It was a duty that he did (giving the correct advice to his sons), although it could not prevent what was to happen (with Benjamin (12:75-81)). He was, by Our teaching, full of knowledge. And most people are devoid of that level of insight","12:69":"When they met with Joseph, he brought his brother closer to him and said, \"I am your brother, do not grieve about what they have been doing to us","12:70":"As the camels were loading, one of the brothers hid the drinking-cup in Benjamin's saddlebag (12:77), (12:83), (12:89). Then a caller cried, \"O Camel-riders! You are thieves!\" (The Qur'an here corrects the statement in Genesis that it was Joseph who placed the cup in their pack)","12:71":"They said, coming towards them, \"What is it that you have lost","12:72":"They said, \"We have lost the King's cup, and whoever produces it shall have an extra camel-load, and I (the chief royal servant) guarantee that","12:73":"They explained, \"By God! Well you know that we did not come here to create mischief in the land, and we are no thieves","12:74":"The callers asked, \"What shall be the penalty for it if you prove liars","12:75":"The brothers replied, \"The penalty for it! He in whose bag the cup is found he shall be the penalty for it. (The thief belongs to you). Thus we requite the doers of such wrong (in our land)","12:76":"They were brought before Joseph for the search. He began with the bags of his half-brothers before the bag of his brother (Benjamin). And finally extracted the cup out of his brother's bag. We thus perfected the plan for Joseph. He could not have detained his brother under the King's law. But that was the Will of Allah. We raise people in ranks according to Our Laws. And above every person of knowledge there is One who knows all","12:77":"The brothers said, \"If he stole, so did his brother in the past.\" Joseph stayed quiet, revealing nothing. He only said in his heart, \"You are in worse case, and Allah is the Best Knower of what you allege","12:78":"They said to Joseph, \"O Noble one! He has an aged father, so take one of us instead of him. We see that you are a doer of good","12:79":"Joseph (stressing the circumstantial evidence) answered, \"God preserve us from detaining other than him with whom we have found our property. For, then we would indeed be unjust","12:80":"So, when they lost hope, they conferred in solitude. The eldest among them said, \"Don't you know that your father took a solemn pledge from you in Allah's name, and how you failed in the case of Joseph before? I shall not go from this place until my father gives leave or Allah judges for me. He is the Best of deciders","12:81":"He told the rest of the nine brothers, \"Return to your father and say, 'O Our father! Verily, your son has stolen. We know for sure, because we witnessed it. That was something beyond our knowledge and control","12:82":"Ask the township where we were, and the caravan we came with. We are indeed telling the truth","12:83":"Jacob said, \"Nay, you have made up yet another story good enough only for you. But I resort to decent forbearance. May Allah bring them all to me. Verily, He, only He, is the Knower, the Wise","12:84":"Then Jacob turned away from them saying, \"Alas, my grief for Joseph!\" His eyes glistened with tears but he suppressed his grief.\" (Jacob worried more about Joseph since he had no news of him yet. Many exponents at this point have ventured into strange guesswork. They report that Prophet Jacob became blind with grief and cried incessantly for eighty years grieving for Joseph! The Bible relates that Jacob lived to be 147 years old. Even so, it is not befitting of a Prophet of God, or even an ordinary person, to turn blind with grief and weep incessantly for 80 years. The whiteness of his eyes in this verse clearly refers to his eyes glistening with tears momentarily. And then he controlled his grief)","12:85":"His sons said, \"By God! You will never cease remembering Joseph until your health is ruined or you perish","12:86":"He said, \"I present my distress and anguish only to Allah and I know from Allah what you know not","12:87":"O My sons! Go and find Joseph and his brother and never despair of the soothing Mercy of Allah. None but the disbelievers (in His Attributes) despair of the soothing Mercy of Allah","12:88":"When they came before Joseph, they said, \"O Noble one! We have suffered a lot of hardship along with our family. We bring only inferior barter to pay. So give us the full measure, and be charitable to us. Allah rewards the charitable","12:89":"As he granted the request, Joseph said, \"Do you remember what you did to Joseph and his brother in your ignorance","12:90":"They exclaimed, \"Wow! Is it indeed you who are Joseph?\" He answered, \"I am Joseph and this is my brother. Allah has been Gracious to us. Verily, if one walks aright and is steadfast, Allah never loses the reward of such doers of good","12:91":"They said, \"By God! Certainly Allah has raised you above us, and we were indeed at fault","12:92":"Joseph said, \"There is no blame on you this day! May Allah forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful","12:93":"Now, go and take this royal shirt of mine and show it to my father. He will see the reality of things. Then, bring all your family to me","12:94":"As soon as the caravan departed from Egypt, their father (Jacob) began telling his neighbors in Canaan about the Revelation that his son Joseph was in a position of high authority. \"I do indeed scent the presence of Joseph even though you may call me senile","12:95":"The skeptics said, \"By God! You are still in your old confusion","12:96":"The caravan arrived in Canaan and the good news was given to Jacob. When Joseph's royal shirt was shown to Jacob, he was delighted and his eyes saw the reality. He said, \"Didn't I tell you that I know from Allah what you know not","12:97":"They said, \"O Our father! Ask forgiveness for us, for we trailed behind in your obedience, indeed we were at fault","12:98":"Jacob answered, \"I shall ask forgiveness for you from my Sustainer. Verily, He is Forgiving, Merciful","12:99":"And when they came in before Joseph, he respectfully greeted his parents, \"Welcome to Egypt! God willing you will be in safety and peace here","12:100":"He raised his parents upon the throne of honor. All those present bowed to him in respect (To let his parents see the honor Allah had given their son). Joseph said, \"O My father! This is how my Lord has made my dream come true. He has been very kind to me, since He freed me from the prison, and He has brought you here from the village. Satan (selfishness of my brothers) had sown enmity between us brothers. Verily, my Lord is Sublime in helping the worthy. He is the Knower, the Wise","12:101":"Then, Joseph prayed, \"O My Lord! You have indeed bestowed upon me some kingship, and have imparted to me the insight into events. Originator of the heavens and the earth! You are my Protecting Friend in the world and the Hereafter. Help me remain committed to your Commands till the last breath, and be counted among those who help augment the human potential","12:102":"(O Prophet Muhammad) These are the chapters of the Unseen (history) that We reveal to you. You were not there when the brothers of Joseph decided together and were making their schemes","12:103":"(Although you narrated the accurate account of Joseph as they demanded), most of these people will not believe even as you compassionately so desire","12:104":"Although you ask them no reward for it. It is but a Reminder for the Worlds","12:105":"How many a Sign is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by with their faces turned away","12:106":"The majority of those who claim to believe in Allah, practically submit to false authorities; humans and idols in countless forms. That is indeed SHIRK and they are MUSHRIKOON","12:107":"Do they deem themselves secure from the overwhelming Requital of Allah, or the coming of the Hour suddenly while they are unaware","12:108":"Say (O Prophet), \"This is my way. Resting my call upon insight accessible to reason. I am calling you all to Allah, I and they who follow me.\" (We do not invite through blind faith, vague dogmas or by stunning your intellect with miracles). Glory to Allah! And I am not one of those who ascribe divinity in any form besides Him","12:109":"And even before your time, We never sent (as Our Messengers) but men to whom We revealed Our Messages. We always chose them from among the people of their own communities. Have they then never journeyed about the earth and seen what happened in the end to those who lived before them? And, don't they know that those who walk aright, the life to come is better for them. Will they not then, use reason","12:110":"There have been times when even the Messengers had lost all hope of reformation and thought that they had been denied. Then came Our help. We saved everyone worthy of being saved. Without exception We punished those who thrived on the fruit of others' toil","12:111":"Indeed in the history of these men, there is a lesson for people of understanding. As for this Revelation, it could not possibly be a hadith, fabricated. It confirms the Divine Origin of the previous Scriptures, and gives a detailed explanation of everything.

And (He) created thereon couples of every kind of plants (and their fruit). (Plants have male and female flowers, and some trees like the date-palm are unisexual, male and female). He causes the night to cover the day.

On it, there are vineyards, and fields of grain, date and palm-trees, growing in clusters or standing alone. All of them are watered by the same water and yet, We have made some of them excel others in fruit. Verily, in all this there are Messages for people who use sense","13:5":"If you wonder, then wondrous is their saying, \"What! After we have become dust, shall we indeed be restored to life in a new act of creation?\" It is they who are bent upon denying their Sustainer. As a result, it is they who carry the shackles of their own making around their necks. And it is they who are destined for the Fire, therein to abide","13:6":"(Instead of helping you establish and consolidate the Divine System on earth), they challenge you (O Prophet) to hasten the disaster that strikes nations when they ignore the Divine Values. Sufficient precedents have been set for them in the form of exemplary punishments to generations before them. Now, behold, your Lord is Full of forgiveness for people despite their wrongdoing. But, behold, your Lord is also Strict in retribution!

(O Prophet), indeed if you got influenced by people's likes and dislikes after the Knowledge has come to you, you will have no protector or savior against Allah","13:38":"And verily We sent Messengers before you, and We appointed for them wives and children as well. (They all were mortal human beings and they conveyed Allah's Revelation as commanded). It was not given to any Messenger that he could bring a Sign (the requital they hastened for), but it came according to Allah's Law of Respite. For every rise and for every fall, there is a Written Law","13:39":"Allah blots out and establishes communities according to His Laws. Nations rise and fall accordingly, and with Him is the Ultimate Ordinance","13:40":"(O Messenger) Whether We show you what We promise them, or cause you to die before that, your duty is to convey the Message. And the reckoning is Ours","13:41":"Don't they see that every day on earth brings them closer to the end? For, when Allah judges, there is no power that could repel His Judgment. And Swift in reckoning is He","13:42":"Now those who lived before these people, also devised schemes, but the most Subtle devising is that of Allah. He knows what every \"Self\" earns. The rejecters will soon find out as to whom belongs the Future","13:43":"The disbelievers say, \"You have not been sent (by God).\" Say, \"None can bear witness between me and you as Allah does; and then, none can bear witness as the one who truly understands this Book by way of reason.\" (Allah will soon prove me true)","14:1":"L.R. Alif. Laam. Ra. Allah Aleem the Knower, Raziq the Provider. A Divine Writ is this that We have revealed to you (O Prophet). So that you may bring forth all mankind, by their Sustainer's leave, out of darkness into Light. On to the Way that leads to the Almighty, the Owner of all praise. (","14:2":"Allah to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. (His Commands must govern your social order as they govern the Universe). Therefore, those who reject His Guidance, incur an awful retribution","14:3":"They choose the life of this world as the sole object of their love, preferring it to the life to come, and debar people from the Path of Allah. (They oppose reform in order to protect their vested interests). They try to make the Straight Path crooked. They have indeed gone far astray","14:4":"We never sent a Messenger who did not speak the language of his people, so that he might make the Message clear to them. People go astray or attain guidance according to Allah's Laws (4:88). He is Almighty, Wise","14:5":"(Moses spoke the language of his people.) We sent him with Our Messages, saying, \"Bring your people from darkness to Light and remind them of the days of Allah (when different nations earned His Blessings). Verily, there are lessons in the history of nations for those who are steadfast in their resolve to rise as a community and wish that their efforts be fruitful.\" (SHUKR or gratefulness is not just the verbal proclamation of 'Thank God!' It pertains to our efforts bearing fruit, and then our sharing of the fruit of success with the servants of Allah)","14:6":"And, Moses spoke thus to his people, \"Remember Allah's Blessing upon you when he saved you from Pharaoh's people. They used to persecute you, and were killing your sons and sparing your women. From your Lord's Law of Requital that was a tremendous hardship on you","14:7":"Your Lord proclaimed, \"If you become practically grateful (by establishing a system where everyone equitably receives the Divine Bounties), I will give you more. And if you violated this Law, remember that My Requital is strict","14:8":"Moses made it clear to his people that obedience to the Divine Commands was only good for them, \"If you deny the Truth, you and all those who live in the earth, know that Allah is indeed Self-sufficient, Owner of Praise","14:9":"Has not the history of the previous nations reached you? Of Noah and Aad and Thamud, and others who came after them, known only to Allah? (Their histories not known to people). Their Messengers came to them with clear evidence of the Truth, but the people tried to smother their voice, saying, \"We reject what you have been sent with. We are in great doubt concerning your call","14:10":"Their Messengers said, \"Can there be any doubt about Allah, the Initiator of the Highs and the Lows? He only calls you that He may grant you the protection of His forgiveness, to save you from trailing behind in humanity and to sustain your community for a long time.\" They said, \"You are but mortals like us! You want us to turn away from the way our ancestors used to worship. Then bring us a convincing miracle?\" (Allah is far too Glorious from feeling offended by idol worship in any form. But submitting to false deities and 'authorities' is the root cause of inequities in any society, such as superstition, exploitation, ritualism and division of humanity into castes and sects, and the resulting violation of human rights. That is why all Messengers of God began their mission by calling people to the worship and obedience of the One True God)","14:11":"Without exception their Messengers said to them, \"Yes, we are human beings like you. Allah gives His grace of Revelation to whom He chooses among His servants. We work within the Laws of Allah that preclude the performance of supernatural miracles.\" (The right way to attain firm belief is reflecting at the Universe, within our own selves, at the accounts of history, and upon these verses. That is the general approach of the Book). \"Then you can attain the belief whence you can firmly put your trust in the never changing Laws of Allah","14:12":"Why should we not put our trust in Allah? Even in the face of your persecution, we walk the path we have been shown, with uncompromising resolve. All those who wish to entrust the results of their actions with someone, must put their ultimate trust in the Laws of Allah","14:13":"The rejecters resorted to threatening the Messengers, \"We will banish you from our land unless you join our religion.\" Then their Lord revealed to them, \"Verily, Our Law of Requital will bring low those who try to displace truth with falsehood and insist on running oppressive systems","14:14":"And verily We will establish you in the land after them. This reward is for those who recognize My Majesty and My Warning, and thus respect the Permanent Values given by Me","14:15":"The Messengers earnestly sought help from their Lord, and every stubborn tyrant ended up frustrated","14:16":"Behind every stubborn tyrant, the enemy of Truth, is the Hell of his own making and before him is the drink of distress. (Such people hinder their own development and forfeit inner peace in this life as well)","14:17":"How difficult it is to swallow the bitterness of self-imposed failure! A life unlived, a mere survival, neither living nor dead (20:74), (87:13). What a heavy retribution","14:18":"Here is a similitude. The works of those who live rejecting the Permanent Values of their Lord are like ashes that the wind blows away on a stormy day. They gain naught for their deeds (13:17). That is the outcome of following trails that lead nowhere","14:19":"Have you not realized that Allah has created the heavens and the earth with a sublime Purpose? If He Will, He can do away with you and bring a new creation. (4:133), (7:146), (","14:20":"Implementation of His Laws is not at all difficult for Allah","14:21":"All mankind will appear before Allah. Then the ones who had disabled their minds with blind following will say to their 'self-glorified' leaders, \"We used to follow you. Can you divert some of the requital from us?\" The leaders will respond, \"If Allah had guided us, we would have guided you. Ah, it is too late! Now it makes no difference whether we panic in grief or try to bear it in patience, there is no escape for us.\" (It is noteworthy here that Satan had brought the same argument that his Lord sent him astray)","14:22":"Satan (their selfish desires) will disown them after the Judgment has been issued, \"Verily Allah promised you a true promise; and I promised you and failed you. And I had no power over you except that I called unto you and you obeyed me. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. Neither can I help you, nor can you help me. I refuse to accept that you worshiped me ever.\" Verily, for those who displace trust with betrayal is a painful doom","14:23":"And those who attained belief and augmented the human potential, will be admitted to the Gardens underneath which rivers flow, therein abiding by their Lord's Leave. Their greeting therein is, \"Peace","14:24":"See! Allah teaches you by an example. A Goodly Word! The Divine Ideology is like a good tree firmly rooted in the earth and its branches are swinging high in the heaven. (This Ideology ensures blessings in both lives. Also, it guarantees prosperity in the earth under Heavenly Guidance)","14:25":"The tree of this Ideology bears fruit in all seasons by Leave of its Lord. Allah gives examples to mankind that they may reflect","14:26":"And the example of an evil ideology is that of a bad tree that gets easily uprooted from the surface of the earth, and it has no stability. (It is neither firmly rooted, nor reaches any heights)","14:27":"Allah strengthens those who accept (the good tree of) Divine Ideology in the life of this world and in the Hereafter. Allah's Law sends astray those who displace truth with falsehood. And Allah does everything according to His Laws","14:28":"Have you not seen those who respond to the blessings of Allah with ingratitude and lead their people to an abode of utter desolation? (They show ingratitude by holding on to Allah's blessings for themselves, and exhort their people to do the same)","14:29":"Hell, which they will have to endure, what an evil place to stay","14:30":"They set up rivals to Allah that they may mislead people from His Path. (They take \"Imams\" as their authorities instead of the Word of Allah, thus setting up rivals to Him). Tell them, \"Enjoy life while you may, for your sure destination is the Fire","14:31":"(O Prophet) \"Tell My servants to establish and consolidate the Divine System and spend of the provision We have given them, on others, secretly and publicly, before a Day comes wherein there shall be no trading of deeds nor friendship be of avail","14:32":"(Think about the Source of your wealth and provision). Allah it is Who has created the heavens and the earth, and sends down water from the sky, thereby producing fruit and vegetation as provision for you. And He makes ships and boats to be of service to you that they sail in the sea by His Command, and has made of service to you the rivers","14:33":"And makes the sun and the moon, both of them constant on their courses. And committed the night and the day to serve you","14:34":"And He gives you all that you would be asking Him for (55:29). If you count the blessings of Allah's provision (they are so diverse that) never will you be able to number them. But verily, man when practically ingrate, is a wrongdoer to himself. (He is given to greed and hoarding)","14:35":"Mankind needs Divine Guidance to be saved from selfishness and greed. To teach justice and equity among people Abraham founded the Sacred Center (2:125)). Recall that Abraham said, \"My Lord! Make this a peaceful land and preserve me and my children from worshiping idols in any form","14:36":"My Lord! The keepers of these idols and temples mislead a great many people. Whoever will follow me, will be of me, as the relationships would stand on Ideology (2:124), (60:4). Anyone who rebels against me, his or her case shall be with You. You are Forgiving, Merciful. You provide sustenance indiscriminately","14:37":"Our Lord! I have settled some of my family in this barren, plant-less valley by your Sacred House. Our Lord! They are here to establish the Divine System. Give them the nobility of character so that the hearts of people incline toward them.

Nothing is hidden from Allah in the Low and High","14:39":"All Praise to Allah Who has given me sons like Ishmael and Isaac in later age! My Lord is indeed the Hearer of prayer","14:40":"My Lord! Enable me and my children to establish the Divine System. Our Sustainer! And (earnestly do I ask) accept the prayer","14:41":"Our Lord! Grant the shelter of forgiveness to me, my parents, and the believers on the Day when the final reckoning comes to pass","14:42":"Deem not that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers are doing. He but gives them respite. They will stare in horror on the Day when all their deeds will reach their logical conclusion","14:43":"They will be on the run to and fro with their heads uplifted in tension as they stare at what they behold, and their hearts vacant of all hope","14:44":"Hence, warn mankind of the Day when this suffering may befall them, and every violator of the Divine Commands will long for a little more respite, saying, \"Our Lord! Give us a little time. We will obey Your Message and follow the Messengers.\" The answer will be given, \"Did you not use to swear before that there shall be no decline of status for you","14:45":"You dwelled in the homes and towns where people before you had dwelt and wronged themselves oppressing the weak. And you were made well aware of how Our Law of Requital dealt with them. And We gave you plenty of examples","14:46":"Their schemes, all recorded with Allah, were strong enough to intimidate the strongest of resolves. But, since their schemes were pitched against the Divine Laws, they utterly failed","14:47":"So think not that Allah could ever fail to keep His Promise to His Messengers.

God is the Sustainer and Cherisher of all humanity and His Law is Supreme (1:1), (114:1).

Then they hold secret meetings and these wrongdoers say, \"You only follow a man who is under the influence of magic.\" (It is unfortunate that under the influence of fabricated traditions, most of the Muslims even today believe that a Jewish magician successfully cast a spell of 'magic' on the exalted Prophet!

The most blatant example is of Thamud who violated the clear sign of their submission, and failed the crucial test by killing the she-camel. (7:73), (11:89), (26:141), (27:45). We continued to send Messages for mankind to establish the Order in which peace would replace fear","17:60":"And, We said to you (O Prophet), \"Behold, your Lord encompasses all mankind, so We have given you the Vision.\" (Through this Final Message, We have given you the VISION that they shall all become One Community again).

Bestow on us Grace from Yourself and endow us with insight into the right (and wrong) of all situations","18:11":"And thereupon We veiled their ears in the Cave for some years. (They remained isolated, hiding from the soldiers of Emperor Decius during his reign, 249-251 C.E)","18:12":"And then We caused them to rise (out of the Cave). We let them know for themselves which of the two groups, (the young men with their friends in town, or their opponents), had better availed the time. (The Dwellers of the Cave had maintained secret communication with like-minded people in Ephesus)","18:13":"And now (contrary to hearsay) We shall relate to you (O Prophet) their true history. Behold, they were young men who truly believed in their Lord and We increased them in guidance","18:14":"We strengthened their hearts, and they took a firm stand. They said to one another, \"Our only Lord is the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth. Never shall we submit to any 'authority' other than Him.

(The Cave lay North South and while it was roomy from inside its entrance was small). It is a sign of Allah that (He arranged for them excellent camouflage and) whom Allah guides is the rightly guided, and whom He lets go astray for violating the Divine Laws of guidance, for such, you will find no protector who would point out the right way","18:18":"You would have deemed that they were awake, even when they slept.

Had you come upon them suddenly, you would have turned away from them in flight in awe","18:19":"And so, when We caused them to rise (out of the Cave), they began to ask one another (about the next step). One of them asked, \"How long have you been here?\" \"We have been here a day or part of a day!\" they answered. Finally they said, \"Your Lord knows best how long.

Let one of you go with these silver coins to the town, and look for the best available food, and bring you some provisions. But let him exercise caution, and by no means make anyone aware of you","18:20":"For, behold, if they discover you, they will stone you to death or force you to revert to their religion, then you will never succeed","18:21":"And in this way We caused them to be discovered (their mission had succeeded), and everyone realized that Allah's Promise is always true. There remained no doubt about the Revolution. (The Dwellers of the Cave were revered by their nation as the Divine Order was restored. Time went by and they passed on. The reverence of the people took a turn). Some people said, \"Erect a building in their memory. God knows best their true stature.\" Others, whose opinion prevailed, said, \"Indeed, we must raise a house of worship in their memory.\" The building in which they would submit to the One True God, like a Masjid.

To one of them, We had given two vineyards, and surrounded them with date palms and placed a field of grain in between","18:33":"Both gardens produced plenty of fruit on time, as We caused a rivulet to flow through them","18:34":"And so the man had fruit in abundance. One day he boastfully said to his friend, \"I am more than you in wealth and in honor among people","18:35":"And having thus wronged himself, he entered his garden saying, \"I don't think that this will ever perish","18:36":"He said, \"I don't think that the Hour will ever come.

The only invincible protection comes from Allah alone. He is the Best to grant recompense, and the Best to determine what must be","18:45":"Cite for them the example of the materialistic life of this world.

It leaves out nothing, be it small or great, but takes everything into account!\" In the Divine System every deed, small or big will come forth (53:39-40).

Unless they choose the fate of the ancient people to befall them or that the doom reaches them even faster","18:56":"But We send the Messengers only as heralds of glad tidings and as Warners. Whereas the rejecters contend with false arguments, trying to refute the Truth, and to make My Verses and warnings a target of their mockery","18:57":"And who does greater harm to himself than the one to whom his Lord's Messages are conveyed and he turns away from them, forgetting what he is doing and what wrong he has done before? Our Law makes their hearts and ears impermeable to reason and advice. No matter what you do to guide them, they will not allow themselves to be shown the right way","18:58":"Yet, your Lord is the Truly-Forgiving One, full of Grace. He could task the rejecters right away for whatever wrong they commit, and punish them then and there. But He gives them a period of respite beyond which they shall find no refuge","18:59":"Our Law of Requital annihilated many communities when they went on and on with their unjust systems. They were all given a due period of respite (in order to make amends) and We set up a time-limit for their annihilation","18:60":"The Divine Revelation shows the Way and the outcome with conviction. When Moses was a young man, not yet commissioned as a Prophet, he was constantly in search of Truth (93:7). All Prophets were chosen by birth but assigned their mission at a later date. The young Moses knew that the human intellect was the source of conceptual knowledge whereas the Divine Revelation is the extrinsic knowledge from beyond human faculties.) And so, in the course of his quest for knowledge Moses said to his young friend, \"I shall not give up until I reach the junction of the two streams, though I march on for ages in my quest.\" (INTELLECT AND REVELATION -- the two streams of knowledge)","18:61":"But when Moses with his young friend reached the junction of the two streams, they forgot all about the fish, and it took its way into the sea and disappeared from sight. (Moses found himself caring little for the delicacies of life from then on)","18:62":"And after the two had walked some distance, Moses said to his young friend, \"Bring us our lunch, the journey has been tiring","18:63":"Said his friend, \"Would you believe it? When we rested at the rock, I forgot about the fish and none but Satan, my wandering thoughts, made me forget it. And it took its way into the sea. How strange","18:64":"Moses said, \"That is what we were seeking!\" And the two turned back retracing their footsteps. (Moses retired to rest in deep thought)","18:65":"(Moses wondered how exciting the merging of the two streams would be! And he imagined that) he found a servant of Ours, on whom We had bestowed grace from Our Presence and unto whom We had imparted knowledge from Ourselves","18:66":"Moses (in his contemplation) said to the man, \"May I follow you that you may teach me some of the knowledge and guidance which you have been taught","18:67":"He said, \"Verily, you won't be able to have patience with me","18:68":"And how can you bear with that which you cannot comprehend","18:69":"Moses said, \"God willing, you will find me patient and I will not disobey you","18:70":"The man said, \"Well, if you go with me, ask me not any questions unless I choose to tell you about it","18:71":"So they went on until they were in a boat and he made a hole in it. Moses said, \"Did you make a hole to drown people? You have done something terrible","18:72":"The man said, \"Didn't I tell you that you could not bear with me","18:73":"Said Moses, \"Do not rebuke me for forgetting. And be not hard on me for my fault","18:74":"So they went on till, when they met a lad, he slew him. Moses said, \"What! Have you slain an innocent person who had slain none? Verily, you have done a horrible thing","18:75":"The man said, \"Didn't I tell you that you could not bear with me","18:76":"Moses said, \"If I ask you after this about anything, then do not keep me with you. By then you shall have received enough excuses from me","18:77":"So they proceeded. When they reached a township, they asked its folk for food, but they refused them hospitality. Soon they saw a wall that was about to collapse, and he fixed it. Moses said, \"If you had wished, you could taken a wage for that","18:78":"He replied, \"This is the parting between you and me! But I will explain to you the real meaning of things you could not bear with patience","18:79":"As for the boat, it belonged to poor people working on the river, and I wished to make it defective. For, behind them was a king who was taking every (good) boat by force","18:80":"And as for the lad, his parents were true believers whereas we had every reason to fear that he would bring bitter grief upon them by rebellion and disbelief","18:81":"And so we desired that their Sustainer grant them instead of him, a child better in purity of conduct and affection","18:82":"As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the town. And there was a treasure for them, beneath the wall. Their late father was a righteous man, and your Lord wanted them to grow up to full maturity and then extract their treasure as a Mercy from your Lord. I did it not of my own accord (but carried out the Divine Command). This is the explanation of things you could not stand.\" (As the pondering was over, Moses understood that Revelation is to the intellect what the sunlight is to the eye. Thus ended his intellectual journey. Later on Moses was commissioned to Prophethood and experienced the Divine Revelation first hand)","18:83":"(O Messenger) They ask you about Zul-Qarnain. Say, \"I will convey to you something by which he is worth remembering","18:84":"We established him in power on earth and granted him the ways and means to accomplish his objectives","18:85":"Zul-Qarnain, (King Cyrus the great of Persia, 590-529 B.C.) set out for an expedition. He chose the right means in whatever he did","18:86":"(Conquering land to the West toward Lydia, he reached as far as the Black Sea.) The sun was setting and it appeared to him as if it was setting in the dark waters. (The local nation, given to wrongdoing, fought against him and lost). We said, \"O Zul-Qarnain! Either punish or be kind to them","18:87":"Cyrus said to them, \"As for him who does wrong from now on, we shall punish him. And then he will be brought back before his Lord Who will commit him to greater retribution","18:88":"But whoever will believe and work for the good of others, good will be his reward and we will treat him kindly","18:89":"(After establishing peace in the West) he once again chose the right means to achieve a right end. (He set forth to an expedition towards the East)","18:90":"Then he reached (Balkh in Afghanistan) the rising place of the sun, the easternmost point of his expedition. He found it rising on a people for whom We had appointed no shelter from it. (They built no houses and lived a nomadic life)","18:91":"So it was, and We knew all about him and his resources. (He helped that nation with his abundant resources that We had given him)","18:92":"And once again he chose the right means to achieve a right end. (North towards Caucasus)","18:93":"When he reached the valley between two mountain ranges, he found people whose language was barely understandable to him","18:94":"(Through interpreters) they presented a grievance, \"O Zul-Qarnain! Behold, Gog and Magog are spoiling this land. They keep attacking and commit bloody crimes. May we, then, pay to you a regular tribute that you will erect a barrier between us and them","18:95":"He responded, \"The power in which My Lord has established me is better than tribute. Help me then with manpower; I will erect a strong barrier between you and them","18:96":"Bring me pieces of iron.\" (His engineers worked their skills using dirt and molten iron and filled the gap between the mountains). When he had filled up the space between the two steep mountainsides, he said, \"(Light a fire and) blow with your bellows!\" When it was red hot, he said, \"Bring me molten copper and tar to pour over it","18:97":"Thus they (Gog and Magog) could not climb it, nor could they bore holes in it","18:98":"Said the King, \"This is a mercy from my Lord. Yet when the time appointed by my Lord shall come, He will make this barrier level with the ground. And my Lord's Promise always comes true. (This barrier will stay in place and crumble according to the Divine Laws in the Universe)","18:99":"(Zul-Qarnain was correct that such obstructions would become immaterial with time.) We will let some nations to invade others on a day when the trumpets of war will be blown. Then We will gather them together in battle-fields. (Gog and Magog, the powerful imperialist nations will exploit one another and the weaker nations and great wars will take place)","18:100":"Peoples who had been rejecting the Divine Writ that 'Mankind is one community,' We will cause them to face hell at the hands of one another","18:101":"They whose eyes were veiled to see My Reminder, and who could not bear to hear","18:102":"Do the disbelievers in My Reminder think that they can choose my servants as allies besides Me? Verily, We have readied hell as a welcome for the disbelievers. (No matter what coalitions they make, if they befriend systems other than the Divine Order, they will end up in hell)","18:103":"Say, \"Shall We inform you who the worst losers are in respect of their deeds","18:104":"They are the ones whose effort in the life of the world remains misdirected. And yet they think that they are doing good work. (They work in the wrong cause, contrary to the Divine Reminder)","18:105":"It is they who have chosen to deny their Sustainer's Messages and the truth that they are destined to meet Him. Hence, their works are vain, and on the Day of Resurrection We will assign no weight to them","18:106":"That is their reward, Hell! For, they rejected the Truth, and ridiculed My Messages and My Messengers","18:107":"But verily, as for those who attain belief and fulfill the needs of others, the gardens of Paradise will be there to welcome them","18:108":"Therein shall they abide. They will not even desire a change","18:109":"Say, \"If all the sea were ink for my Sustainer's Words, the sea would indeed be exhausted before my Sustainer's Words are exhausted! And thus it would be if We were to add to it sea upon sea","18:110":"Say (O Prophet), \"I am but a mortal man like all of you. It is revealed to me that your God is the One and Only God. Hence, whoever looks forward to meeting His Sustainer, let him do works that help others, and let him admit no one as partner in the service of his Sustainer","19:1":"H.Y.'A.S. Kareem the Honored, Hadi the Guide, Yamen the Bounteous, Aleem the Knower, Sadiq the Truthful","19:2":"Relates to you a mercy of your Sustainer unto His servant Zachariah","19:3":"When he called out to his Lord in the secrecy of his heart","19:4":"He said, \"My Lord! My bones have turned brittle and my head is shining with gray hair, and I have never remained unblessed in my prayer to you, my Lord","19:5":"Now I fear what my relatives will do after me.

Oh, Give me from Your Presence, a successor","19:6":"Let him be my heir and the heir of the house of Jacob and make him, my Lord, worthy of Your acceptance","19:7":"He was told, \"O Zachariah! We give you the good news of a boy whose name shall be Yahya (John the Baptist). We have never given this name to anyone before","19:8":"Zachariah exclaimed, \"My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren and I am already infirm with old age","19:9":"He said, \"Thus it is. Your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me.' I created you before, and you were nothing.\" (The infertility in his wife was treated)","19:10":"Zachariah said, \"My Lord! Give me a special message.\" He said, \"The Message is that you shall not speak to people for three nights (and days) consecutively.\" (He was not to break the news too soon, before he and his wife Elizabeth got over their excitement). (3:40)","19:11":"Then Zachariah came out from the shrine and told his deputies by signs, \"Keep striving in your mission morning and evening that his Glory be manifest to beholders","19:12":"(John was born according to the good news.) We told him \"O Yahya! Hold fast the Scripture.\" And We had granted him wisdom and good judgment when he was yet a little boy","19:13":"We gave him compassion and a spotless character. And he lived an upright life","19:14":"He was dutiful toward his parents, and was polite, not rebellious or arrogant","19:15":"Peace on him the day he was born, the day he died and the day he shall be raised alive","19:16":"(O Prophet) Make mention of Mary in the Book when she withdrew from her people to an eastern location. (She left the sanctuary and went to her village in Nazareth)","19:17":"(Since she was not used to mixing with people), she had chosen seclusion from them. Then We sent to her Our angel who appeared to her in the shape of a well-made human being (although he had no physical or material existence)","19:18":"She exclaimed, \"Verily, I seek refuge in the Most Gracious that you may be righteous","19:19":"He said, \"I am only a Messenger of your Lord who says 'I shall bestow upon you the gift of a son endowed with a spotless character.'\" (Tasreef with (3:45) is very important here","19:20":"She said, \"How can I have a son when no man has ever touched me?

You have come with an amazing thing (breaking the rules of the shrine)","19:28":"O Sister of Aaron! Your father was not a bad man, nor was your mother a loose woman, nor did she ever oppose the system","19:29":"Then she pointed to him. They said, \"How can we talk to one who is in the cradle, a young boy?\" (In the cradle, idiomatically means a young person. Mary and Joseph had stayed in Bethlehem for several years)","19:30":"But he spoke up, \"Behold, I am a servant of God.

Behold, There has indeed come to me of knowledge that came not to you. Follow me then, and I will lead you onto a perfect way","19:44":"O My father! Serve not the Satan.

And Peace be upon him who follows Right Guidance","20:48":"Verily, it has been revealed to us that doom will be for him who is bent upon denial and turns away","20:49":"Pharaoh said, \"Who then is the Lord of you two, O Moses","20:50":"He replied, \"Our Lord is He who creates and shapes everything, assigns its role and guides it aright","20:51":"(Pharaoh in front of his courtiers thought up a tricky question). He said, \"What then is the state of the previous generations?\" (The forefathers of the dignitaries sitting around, who never believed in your Lord)","20:52":"(Pharaoh expected Moses to say that they would be in Hellfire, and that would infuriate the courtiers.) Moses responded, \"The knowledge of that is with my Lord in a Record. My Lord neither errs nor forgets","20:53":"He it is Who has made the earth a cradle for you, and has traced out ways thereon enabling you to go about therein by roads and channels. And He sends down from the sky water.\" And, by this means We bring forth different classes and pairs of plants","20:54":"Saying, \"Eat and raise your cattle. Verily, herein are signs for men and women of thought","20:55":"From the earth We created you, into it We return you and from it We will bring you forth a second time","20:56":"And (through Moses) We made Pharaoh aware of all Our Messages. (The Message plainly refuted Pharaoh's long-standing claim that he was the high lord of people since he owned the land, the rivers and the resources of Egypt (43:46-54), (79:17-26)). But he stubbornly rejected the Message","20:57":"He said, \"Have you come here to destabilize our country and drive us out of our land with your false religion and magical arguments, O Moses","20:58":"In that case, We will certainly produce before you the like thereof! (Will answer your arguments and arrange a debate between you, and our priests). Set up an appointment between us and you. Neither we, nor you shall break this appointment. It will be at a location convenient to us both and where both parties will have even chances.\" (7:104-126), (10:76-8)","20:59":"Answered Moses, \"Your appointed time is the forthcoming Day of the Festival. And let the people be assembled after sunrise","20:60":"Pharaoh turned and collected his strength. (In the next few days he summoned his master debaters, the priests from various towns). And then he came at the appointed time","20:61":"Moses warned Pharaoh's debaters, \"Woe unto you! Invent not a lie against God, lest He afflict you with suffering, for whoever invents such a lie is already undone","20:62":"On hearing this, they debated among themselves about what they must do but they kept their talk secret","20:63":"The chiefs, seeing their hesitation, said to the debaters, \"Behold, these two are wizards of logic, capable of carrying the masses with them, destroying your time-honored traditions, and thus estranging you in your own country or causing a great rebellion that drives you out of the land","20:64":"The chiefs took matters very seriously and commanded the debaters, \"So arrange your plan, and face Moses and Aaron as a united front. Indeed, he is the victor today who gains the upper hand","20:65":"The debaters asked, \"O Moses! Do you begin or shall we go first","20:66":"He said, \"Nay, you go first.\" Their smart presentation appeared to him to put life into otherwise feeble arguments with their logic wandering in different directions. (They were throwing the ropes of falsehood against the Rope of Allah)","20:67":"Moses feared in his heart that their expertise of playing with words might influence the audience","20:68":"We said, \"Fear not! Verily, it is you who will prevail","20:69":"Present your case with confidence and the sheer power of Truth will swallow all their handiwork. Their fabrication is no more than a scheme of deception. And the liars succeed not against the Truth, however skillfully they design their strategy","20:70":"Then down fell the debaters prostrating themselves, and exclaimed \"We have come to believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses","20:71":"Pharaoh said, \"Have you come to believe in him before I give you permission? Verily, he must be your master who has conspired with you. I will cut off your hands and feet on alternate sides and then I will crucify all of you on the palm trunks. Then you will know for certain which of us can give the more severe and the more lasting punishment, (the Lord of Moses or me)","20:72":"They answered, \"Never shall we choose you above the clear evidence of the Truth that has come to us, nor prefer you over Him Who brought us into being! So issue whatever decree you will. Your judgment can only touch us in this worldly life","20:73":"As for us, behold, we have come to believe in our Lord hoping that He may forgive us our faults. And that He may forgive us for the lies that you had forced us to speak. For, Allah is Best and Most Abiding","20:74":"Verily, as for him who shall appear before his Sustainer while he had been violating human rights, for him shall be Hell. He will neither die there nor live. (1)","20:75":"Whereas he who appears before Him as a believer who had been doing good to others, such people will have lofty ranks","20:76":"And Gardens of Eden (Perpetual Bliss) beneath which rivers flow, therein to abide. That shall be the recompense of all those who have developed their personality. (They have actualized their \"Self\" by helping humanity with their wealth and person)","20:77":"Finally, a time came when We commanded Moses, \"Take away My servants by night and find for them a dry path through the Sea of Reeds. Fear not of being overtaken (by Pharaoh), and dread not the sea.\" (7:130), (2)","20:78":"Pharaoh pursued them with his forces, but the high tide completely overwhelmed them, and covered them up","20:79":"This is because Pharaoh had led his nation astray and had not guided them aright. (Therein is an example that the top leadership could make or break a nation)","20:80":"O Children of Israel! We saved you from your enemy, and then made a Covenant with you by the right-hand slope of Mount Sinai, and gave you ample provision, meats and wholesome vegetation. (2:57), right slope","20:81":"Saying, \"Partake and enjoy the decent provisions which We have bestowed upon you. But do not disregard equity and none shall be deprived of the natural resources. Transgress not in this respect lest My disapproval should descend on you. And those nations on whom descends My disapproval do perish indeed","20:82":"And verily, I am the Protecting Forgiver. There is plenty of room in My Laws to forgo wrongs of the past, so repent by coming back to the right path. Those who believe in My Laws, keep the collective good of the society in mind, and maintain that Order, will find themselves on the way to Success","20:83":"(Once, Moses was a step ahead in excitement.) Said his Lord, \"What has made you hasten from your people, O Moses","20:84":"Moses answered, \"They are doing fine following my footsteps. I have rushed to You my Lord, so that You may be well-pleased with me","20:85":"Said He, \"Our Law has tried your people after you left them, and As-Samiri has misguided them","20:86":"Moses went back to his people angry and sad, \"O My people! Has not your Lord promised you many a goodly promise? Did, then, the fulfillment of this promise seem to you too long in coming? Or did you wish that your Lord's requital come upon you, and so you broke your promise to me","20:87":"They said, \"We intended to break no promises. But this is what happened. We were loaded with the sinful burdens of the (Egyptian people's) ornament, and so we threw them into the fire, as suggested by this As-Samiri","20:88":"Then As-Samiri (experienced in sculpting) made the effigy of a calf. It even brought forth a lowing sound with wind or when blown into. So they said, \"This is your god, and the god of Moses, but he has forgotten","20:89":"They knew full well that, like all false deities, the golden calf could not respond to queries, and had no control over their harm or benefit","20:90":"And Aaron indeed had told them beforehand, \"O My people! You are being tempted to evil by this idol. Behold, your only Lord is the Beneficent! Follow me then, and obey my order","20:91":"They said, \"We will by no means cease worshiping it until Moses comes back to us","20:92":"When he returned, Moses asked, \"O' Aaron! What stopped you when you saw them going astray","20:93":"That you followed me not? Didn't you disobey my order","20:94":"Aaron said, \"O Son of my mother! Don't get mad at me, nor treat me harshly. I feared that you would say, \"You have let the Children of Israel divide into parties and sects.\" (Moses accepted this explanation since sectarianism is no less a crime than idol worship in any form. Seizing the beard and head pertains to harsh interrogation)","20:95":"Moses now turned to Samiri, \"What do you have to say O Samiri","20:96":"He answered, \"I have gained insight into something which they have not. So I took hold of a handful of the Messenger's teachings and cast it away. This is what my mind prompted me to do","20:97":"Moses said, \"Go away then, for good! In this life it is for you to say, \"Touch me not!\" And moreover you have a promise that will not fail. (People will consider and treat you as untouchable as before, and the suffering of the Hereafter is inescapable). Now, look at your god to whom you were so devoted. Verily, We will burn it and scatter its ashes far and wide over the sea.\" (Moses wanted his people to behold the powerlessness of the false deities and their potential to divide humanity)","20:98":"Moses continued addressing his people, \"Your God is only Allah; there is no god but He. He embraces all things in His Knowledge","20:99":"(O Prophet) We thus tell you some news of what happened in the past. And We have given you a Reminder from Our Presence","20:100":"Whoever turns away from it, he will, verily, bear a heavy load on the Day of Resurrection","20:101":"Abiding under it, an evil burden for them on the Day of Resurrection","20:102":"The Day when the Trumpet will be blown. On that Day We will assemble the guilty with their eyes dimmed in fear of retribution","20:103":"Whispering among themselves, \"You have lived but ten days","20:104":"We know best all they will say. The most perceptive of them shall say, \"You have lived but a day.\" (75:2)","20:105":"They ask you (O Messenger), \"What shall become of the mountains, the tycoons of power and wealth?\" Say, \"My Lord will blow them away like dust.

The Call that is straight, without crookedness (2:186), (7:86), (18:1), (33:46)). And they will follow the call without deviation. The most vociferous of leaders will subdue their voices before the Message of the Beneficent. You will only hear soft voices, gentle footsteps","20:109":"On that Day, intercession will be of no avail except if one stands up as a witness and is accepted according to the Law of the Beneficent. (None will have the benefit of intercession unless he has entered into a bond with the Beneficent during the life of the world)","20:110":"This information is given by Him Who knows their past and their future, while none encompasses His Knowledge","20:111":"All faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsistent Maintainer of the Universe. And undone will be the violators of human rights","20:112":"Whereas anyone who has done his best to help people, and is a believer in the Divine Values, need have no fear of being wronged or deprived of merit","20:113":"And thus have We sent this down, an Arabic Qur'an, and explained therein warnings in many ways, so that people walk aright or that it makes them rise to a new level of awareness","20:114":"Know, then, that Sublimely Exalted is Allah, the Ultimate Sovereign, the Ultimate Truth. (O Prophet) Hasten not in the learning and implementation of the Message of the Qur'an before a particular revelation to you is completed. These Messages given to you shall be established in stages, but always say, \"My Lord! Increase me in knowledge","20:115":"(Without Divine guidance of Revelation man is easily fallible.) And indeed, long ago We made a covenant with Adam (the mankind) that he would hold fast to Our Commands, but he forgot, and We found no constancy in him. (Adam = Mankind (2:30-3)","20:116":"Recall when We said to the angels, \"Bow before Adam, they bowed except Iblis; he refused.\" (Divine Laws in the Universe have been made of service to man but his selfish desire rebels against himself)","20:117":"And thereupon We said, \"O Adam! Verily, this is an enemy to you and your wife so let him not drive the two of you out of this Garden so that you are landed into difficulty. You shall then have to toil hard for getting your sustenance","20:118":"Behold, you are living the life of Paradise (on this very earth) where you are guaranteed never to go hungry and never to walk improperly clothed","20:119":"Neither do you go thirsty, nor are you exposed to the burning sun.\" (Well provided with food, clothing, shelter, the basic needs)","20:120":"But Satan whispered to him (The selfish desire was teaching him a sinister lesson), \"O Adam! Shall I lead you to the tree of eternal life and ownership that is ever-lasting","20:121":"Man and woman both ate the fruit of the Tree. People started dividing among themselves and their basic necessities of life ceased to remain guaranteed. They had to toil and contend with one another to earn their livelihood. This exposed the flaws in their character. They tried to hide their selfish behavior with superficial courtesy. Adam and his mate had disobeyed their Lord and gone astray","20:122":"Thereafter his Lord elected him and accepted his repentance and guided him","20:123":"He said, \"Go down hence, O humans, males and females, foes to one another competing for sustenance! Nonetheless, there shall most certainly come to you guidance from Me. And whoever follows My Guidance will not go astray, nor will face hardship.\" (Nations who adopt Divine Principles, their economy will be abundant)","20:124":"But whoever will turn away from My remembrance, thus ignoring My Commands, his will be a narrow life.

(Being blind of reason, you disregarded them). And thus, this Day you will be left in oblivion","20:127":"Thus do We reward him who wastes his own \"Self\" and believes not in the Messages of his Sustainer. Indeed, the suffering for them in the life to come shall be severe and enduring","20:128":"Is it not a guidance for them to know how many a generation Our Law destroyed before them, amid whose dwelling-places they now walk? In this, behold, are Signs for men and women of thought","20:129":"Now if it were not for a decree that has already been issued by your Lord, setting a term, (the Law of Respite), the Ultimate Requital would have come upon them at once","20:130":"Hence, (O Prophet) be patient about what they say.

Our Law makes their deeds of instant gratification pleasing in their eyes and so they keep stumbling blindly to and fro","27:5":"It is they whom the worst suffering awaits, and they will be the greatest losers in the Hereafter","27:6":"Surely, you are receiving the Qur'an from the Presence of One Wise, Aware","27:7":"(Moses was also given a clear book. When he and his family were in a cold and dark valley), Moses said, \"Behold, I see a fire. I may bring you news from there (about our location). Or bring you a burning torch so that you might warm yourselves","27:8":"But when he came close to it, he was called, \"Blessed are all who are in and near the Light! And Exalted is Allah, Lord of the Worlds.\" (See (9:32) for the allegory of Fire + Light = Divine Guidance. (7:)","27:9":"O Moses! It is I, Allah, the Almighty, the Wise","27:10":"Allah (revealed Guidance to Moses and) said, \"Now rehearse the Truth.\" When Moses did that, he felt that he had the vibrant Force of Truth in hand. Yet he was awe-struck by the uphill task before him, like grabbing a huge dragon. God said, \"O Moses! Fear not - behold, the Messengers fear not in My Presence.\" (Please note 'kaannaha jann' = as if it was a dragon, concerning the 'asa' or staff in (27:10). Additional Tasreef: (7:108), (20:17-24), (26:10-15), (26:32-33)","27:11":"Nor anyone who has replaced the wrong with good should have any fear. For, verily I am Forgiving, Merciful","27:12":"Now, when you present the Light in your heart with forceful Logic, it will shine with unblemished Truth. Take the Nine of My Messages to Pharaoh and his people - for, verily they are a nation drifting away from the Right Path.\" ((28:32). Nine, and not ten Commandments","27:13":"But when they received Our Light-giving Messages, they said, \"This is clearly a spellbinding deception","27:14":"And they rejected the Messages wrongfully and out of pride, although they were convinced within themselves. And behold what happened in the end to the corrupters","27:15":"And indeed, We bestowed upon David and Solomon knowledge and they used to say, \"Praise be to Allah Who has blessed us more than a great many of His believing servants","27:16":"Solomon was David's heir in continuation of Allah's Revelation. He said, \"O People! We have been given a great cavalry of ready horses with the best knowledge of training them, and given every blessing. This evidently is a great Bounty on our nation.\" ((21:79), (34:10). Solomon ruled as King from 965 to 926 B.C","27:17":"Solomon's army included warrior tribes of the woods and the mountains, dwellers of townships, and great riders of the tribe of Taer. They were well disciplined, and dedicated to any appointed mission","27:18":"Once (when Solomon was on an expedition to the South), they came upon the valley ruled by Queen An-Naml. The Queen, (realizing the power of Solomon), ordered her armies, \"Go back in your barracks, lest Solomon and his armies crush you without knowing that we are a peaceful tribe","27:19":"Solomon smiled joyously at her words and said, \"My Lord! Enable me to be grateful for your blessings upon me and my parents. Enable me to work for the betterment of humanity and thus please You. Include me, by Your Grace, among your righteous servants","27:20":"(Leaving the peaceful tribe of An-Naml alone, Solomon marched forward.) As he examined the cavalry, he said, \"How is it that I do not see the commander","27:21":"(Absconding from the marching army was a breach of discipline.) Solomon said, \"Unless the commander presented a good reason I would punish him or demote him to a low rank","27:22":"But before long","27:23":"Behold, the country is ruled by a Queen who has been given everything and she has a tremendous throne","27:24":"I found her and her people worshiping the sun instead of Allah. Their ego makes them think that they are doing right. Satan (the priesthood of the Sun Temple) hinders them from the Right Path. So they cannot find the Right Way","27:25":"They do not understand that they must adore Allah Who brings forth from His Unseen treasures in the heavens and the earth, and Who knows all that you hide and declare","27:26":"(They need to know that) there is no god but Allah, the Lord of the Supreme Control","27:27":"Solomon listened to the report and decided to carry out further investigation to ascertain the truth. Said he, \"We shall see whether you have told the truth or are one of the liars","27:28":"(He gave a letter to the Commander of the cavalry to take to the court of Sheba, and to watch their response), \"Go with this letter of mine and make sure you convey it to them, and then come back with the answer they give","27:29":"The Queen said, \"O Chiefs! Behold, a very noble letter has been conveyed to me","27:30":"It is from Solomon and it says, 'With the Name of Allah, the Instant and Sustaining Source of all Mercy and Kindness","27:31":"Exalt not yourselves against me, but come to me as those who surrender.'\" (The Kingdom of Queen Bilqis Sheba of Yemen-Abyssinia had hostile plans towards the North)","27:32":"She said, \"O Chiefs! Advise me in this matter. (You know that) I take no decisions without you","27:33":"They said, \"We have the power, we are tough in warfare, and the command is yours. Think about (other aspects of the situation) and order as you will","27:34":"She said, \"Behold, when kings invade a town, they ruin it and humiliate its dignitaries. This is what they shall do","27:35":"Hence, I am going to send a gift to them and see the response that our envoys bring.\" (The intelligent Queen made a prudent decision disregarding the advice of her loyal chiefs. She was cognizant of King Solomon's might, and she was impressed by the benevolent message in the letter)","27:36":"The envoys reached Solomon with the gift and a letter from the Queen. Solomon said, \"What! Do you want to please me with a gift of vanity? Allah has given me better than what He has given you (material wealth and Guidance). Nay, it is you who may exult in your gift.\" (Historically, the gift was studded with precious jewels and diamonds. Solomon, being a Prophet of God and a powerful emperor expected the Queen to denounce her hostile intentions in the region and to reflect about the One True God)","27:37":"Solomon said to the envoys, \"Go back to them, (and tell them that) we verily will come to them with forces they cannot withstand. We shall drive the leaders out of power and humiliate them to shame.\" (Historically the Kingdom of Sheba flourished from 1100 to 115 B.C. At their zenith they were the richest nation in the world. Their economy was based on excellent agriculture and international trade. They had the most advanced irrigation systems of the times, with great water dams. Their Kingdom included today's whole of Yemen, Somalia and Ethiopia, and boasting a strong army, they frequently had expansive designs further south and up north. As the inevitable result of worshiping multiple false deities, including the sun, their society was not without inequities of caste and creed. Solomon, the King and the Prophet, planned to subdue the Sheba Empire to thwart their aggressive designs and to protect the region from oppression. And he succeeded magnificently. Queen Bilqis of Sheba and her nation embraced Solomon's Message and reverted to the worship and obedience of the One True God)","27:38":"(When Solomon found out that the Queen was coming), he said, \"O Chiefs! Which one of you can present the best plan to get her throne before they come to me surrendering?\" (1500 miles between Ma'arib, the capital of Sheba to Jerusalem)","27:39":"One of the strong commanders of the mountain division said, \"My troops can accomplish this mission with lightening speed, before you rise up to think of and assign anyone else. Behold, I am competent and trustworthy for this job","27:40":"Another powerful commander, who had knowledge of the correspondence, said, \"I can accomplish the mission even sooner, before your gaze returns to you (before you having to rethink).\" (Solomon dispatched the forces, and the mission was smoothly accomplished. The Queen's throne was brought to Jerusalem before she arrived and) he saw it set in his presence. He said, \"This success is a blessing from my Lord, that He may try me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. Whoever is grateful is grateful for his own good, and whoever is ungrateful, should know that my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Supremely Honorable","27:41":"Solomon then said, \"Alter her throne for her that we may see whether she gets the point and comes to guidance or she remains unguided.\" (Solomon's workmen had erased the images of the sun god, inscribed sensible inscriptions and made the throne look even more gorgeous)","27:42":"So, when she came, she was asked, \"Is your throne like this?\" She said, \"It seems that this is it! We already knew that the Truth is on your side and my chiefs and I have surrendered to it.\" (The previous knowledge about Solomon's character and Kingdom, the distinguished letters he wrote to her and reports by her envoys, and now his superb court had convinced the intelligent and open-minded Queen)","27:43":"King Solomon redirected her from worshiping others than Allah. She had been one of the disbelieving folk, before. (Solomon advised her that obeying the Laws of Allah could bring not only the best provision in the world but insure eternal success. Queen Sheba embraced the Message and stopped worshiping the sun, and other creations of Allah)","27:44":"She was escorted to the palace. It was said, \"Enter the hall.\" When she saw the smooth polished glass floor, she thought that it was a pool of water and she was spellbound. ('Kashafat 'an saqaiha' idiomatically means that she was spellbound, and not that she bared her calves; a common error of many translators. For example, tying one's hand to the neck means miserliness). Solomon said, \"This is a palace paved smooth with slabs of glass.\" She said, \"I have been doing wrong to myself, and now I submit with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.\" (She realized that following the Divine Laws ensures the best bounties in this life as well. There are some historical accounts that Solomon and Bilqis got married. But the Rabbinical Talmudic traditions propose that they committed adultery then and there, out of which Nimrod Nebuchadnezzar, the tyrant emperor of Babylon was born! That is of course inconceivable of a Prophet of God)","27:45":"And, indeed, We sent to Thamud their brother Saleh saying, \"Serve Allah alone.\" They had become divided into two contending classes (the rich and the poor)","27:46":"Saleh said, \"O My people! Why do you hasten to commit evil instead of doing good? Why do you not (mend your ways and) ask Allah to forgive you, so that you may become worthy of His Mercy","27:47":"They answered, \"We consider you, and your companions a bad omen for us.\" He said, \"Your omen is determined by Allah's Laws. Nay, you are but a folk who are being tested","27:48":"Now there was a gang of nine leaders in the city who spread disorder in the land, and blocked all reform","27:49":"They called a meeting and after swearing to one another in the name of Allah, said, \"Indeed, we shall ambush him and his family by night, and afterward we shall boldly say to his tribe, We know nothing about their death. And, behold, we are men of truth","27:50":"And so they devised an evil scheme. But Our ever-vigilant Law of Requital invariably has counter designs. And they perceived it not","27:51":"Behold, then, how their scheme ended. Our Law annihilated them (the corrupt leaders) and their nation, all of them. (The excuse of the masses that their leaders had led them astray will be of no avail 14: 21-22, 34:31)","27:52":"And now their dwellings are empty, ruined as an outcome of their violation of human rights. Herein, behold, is a sign for those who make use of what they learn","27:53":"And We saved those who believed in Our Laws and walked aright","27:54":"And Lot! (We saved likewise) as he said to his people, \"Will you commit this abomination while you see and understand","27:55":"You approach men with lust instead of women. Nay, you are people who disregard what you know","27:56":"But the answer of his people was nothing but, \"Expel Lot's followers from your town! For, they are people who show off to be pure","27:57":"Thereupon We saved Lot, his household and his followers but his wife - whom We knew was destined to remain behind for her disbelief","27:58":"And We rained a rain upon them. Dreadful is the rain for those who have been warned","27:59":"Say, \"All Praise to Allah and salutation on His servants whom He has raised in ranks!\" Is Allah Best or the 'partners' people ascribe to Him","27:60":"Nay, who is it that has created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water from the sky? And with it We cause to spring forth beautiful orchards. It was never of your doing to make the trees in them grow - any god beside Allah? Nay, they who think so are people who are deviating (from reality)","27:61":"Nay, who is it that has made the earth habitable, and caused rivers to run through it, and has set upon it firm mountains, and has set a barrier between two great bodies of water - any god beside Allah? (25:53). Nay, most of them do not use their knowledge","27:62":"Nay, who is it that responds to the distressed when he calls out to Him, and removes the distress, and made you mankind inheritors of the earth - any god beside Allah? (24:54-55). How seldom do you keep this in mind","27:63":"Nay, who is it that shows you the way in the darkness of land and sea, and sends forth the winds as heralds of His Grace - any god beside Allah? Sublime, Exalted is Allah from all that they associate with Him","27:64":"Nay, who is it that initiates creation, then reproduces it? And who is that provides for you from the heaven and the earth - any god beside Allah? Say, \"If you think so bring your evidence if you are men of truth","27:65":"Say, \"None in the heavens and the earth knows the Unseen - none whatsoever but Allah. Nor do they perceive when they will be raised","27:66":"Nay, their knowledge of the Hereafter stops short of conviction. Nay, they are in doubt concerning it. Nay, they block their mind in blindness from realizing (the unwavering Law of Requital)","27:67":"And so, they who are bent upon denial say, \"What! After we have become dust, and our forefathers, shall we indeed be brought forth again","27:68":"Indeed we were promised this, and our forefathers. It is nothing but fables of ancient times","27:69":"Say, \"Travel in the land and see what has been the end of the guilty","27:70":"And grieve not for them, nor distress yourself because of their plots","27:71":"And they say, \"When is this promise to be fulfilled, if you are men of truth","27:72":"Say, \"You are already going through some of the suffering you challenge","27:73":"Now verily, your Lord is indeed limitless in His bounty to mankind, but most of them do not give thanks (by sharing with others)","27:74":"But, verily, your Lord knows what their hearts conceal, and all that they proclaim","27:75":"And there is nothing hidden in the heaven and the earth but it is in a clear Record","27:76":"Behold, this Qur'an explains to the Children of Israel most of wherein they differ (such as the nature of Jesus)","27:77":"And, verily, it is a Guidance and Grace for all who believe in it","27:78":"Verily, your Lord will judge between them in His Wisdom, for, He is the Mighty, the Knower","27:79":"Hence, put your trust in Allah alone, for, behold, you are taking stand on Truth self-evident","27:80":"But verily, you cannot make the dead (or the \"living-dead\") hear, nor can you make the deaf of heart to hear the call when they turn back to retreat","27:81":"Nor can you lead the blind of reason out of their error. You can only make those hear who believe in Our Signs, so they submit","27:82":"Now, when the Word stands fulfilled against them (humanity paying no heed) We bring forth from among the humbled ones who tell them (by way of rebellion) that mankind has not had conviction in Our Laws.

Or what else was it that you were doing","27:85":"And the Word shall be fulfilled about them since they had oppressed one another. And then, they will be dumbfounded","27:86":"Do they not see that We have made the Night for them to rest in and the Day to give them light? Verily, in this are signs for any people who will believe. (The Divine Laws are as operational in the human society as they are in the Universe)","27:87":"And on the Day when the Trumpet is sounded, everyone of the elite and of the humbled will be horrified, except such as Allah wills to exempt. And, all will present themselves to Him in humility. (6:74), (18:99), (20:102), (2)","27:88":"And the powerful elite that you deem firm as mountains, will float around like weightless clouds. Such is the Design of Allah Who disposes off all things in perfect order. Verily, He is fully Aware of what you do","27:89":"In those times nations that do good to humanity and make way for peace and security, will be best rewarded.

Commandments were given to Moses at Mount Sinai","28:2":"Now these are Messages of the Book clear in itself and it makes things clear","28:3":"We narrate to you some history of Moses and Pharaoh, setting forth the Truth for the benefit of those who will believe","28:4":"Behold, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and divided its people into castes. A tribe among them (the Israelites) he oppressed, killing their sons and sparing their women. Verily, he was of the corrupters. (2:49), (7)","28:5":"But it was Our Will to bestow favor unto those who were oppressed in the land, and to make them leaders, and to make them inheritors","28:6":"And to establish them in the earth, and to show Pharaoh (the King) and Haman (the Chief Adviser and High Priest) and their troops what they feared from the Israelites (rebellion)","28:7":"We inspired the mother of Moses, \"Nourish him and when you worry for his life, then (place him in a box and) cast him into the river, and have no fear nor grieve. We shall bring him back to you and make him one of Our Messengers","28:8":"And the family of Pharaoh picked him up, not knowing that he would become an enemy unto them and a source of grief. That is because Pharaoh, Haman and their troops were a folk bent on committing fault upon fault","28:9":"Now the wife of Pharaoh said, \"A joy to the eye for me and you! Slay him not. He may well be of use to us, or we may adopt him as a son.\" And they perceived not (the future)","28:10":"And the heart of the mother of Moses became void. She almost gave away his identity had We not strengthened her heart, so that she might remain a firm believer","28:11":"And so she said to his sister, \"Follow him -and the girl (the 12 year old Miriam) watched him from afar, while they were not aware","28:12":"Now from the very beginning We caused him to refuse suckling from foster mothers. She (Miriam, the sister of baby Moses) said, \"Shall I tell you of a family that can raise him for you and take good care of him","28:13":"And thus We restored him to his mother so that her eye might be gladdened and that she might grieve no longer, and that she might know that Allah's Promise always comes true. But most of them know not","28:14":"Now when Moses reached full strength and maturity, We blessed him with wisdom and knowledge. This is how We reward those who live a balanced, virtuous life","28:15":"And one day the young Moses entered the city at a time when most of its people were resting unaware of what was going on in the streets. And there he encountered two men fighting with each other. One was of his people (a Hebrew) and the other of his (Egyptian) adversaries. His tribesman cried out to him for help against the one who was of the enemies - Whereupon Moses struck him with his fist and thus, (accidentally) brought about his end. But then he said to himself, \"This is of Satan's doing! Verily, he is an open enemy, a misleader.\" (Moses, not yet commissioned to Prophethood, was denouncing his emotions)","28:16":"And he prayed, \"My Lord! Verily, I have hurt my 'Self'. Forgive me then.\" And He forgave him - for, indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. (Moses had intended only to help the weak and not to kill the other man)","28:17":"He said, \"My Lord! For You have bestowed Your Grace on me, nevermore shall I be a supporter of the guilty","28:18":"And next morning he was in the city, fearful and vigilant when, behold! The man who had asked him the day before cried out to him for help. Moses said to him, \"You are indeed one erring manifestly","28:19":"But then, as soon as he was about to lay his hands on their enemy the man said, \"O Moses! Would you kill me as you killed a person yesterday? Your aim is to become a tyrant in the land, for you care not to be of those who set things right","28:20":"And then and there a man came running from the other side of the city, and said, \"O Moses! Behold, the chiefs are considering your case with a view to killing you. You better leave immediately. Verily, I am of those who wish you well","28:21":"So he escaped from there, fearful, vigilant. He said, \"My Lord! Save me from the oppressive people","28:22":"As he turned his face towards Midyan, he said to himself, \"It may well be that my Lord will guide me onto the right road","28:23":"Now when he arrived at the wells of Midyan, he found a crowd of people watering their herds and flocks. And he found two women who were keeping away their flocks. He asked, \"What is the matter with you?\" They said, \"We cannot water our flocks until the shepherds take back their flocks. And our father is a very old man","28:24":"So he watered their flocks for them; then he turned back to the shade (of the tree he had been relaxing under). And he said, \"My Lord! I am in dire need of any good that You bestow upon me and any opportunity that You provide me for doing good","28:25":"Shortly afterwards, one of the two maidens came to him walking shyly, and said, \"Behold, my father invites you, so that he might duly reward you for having watered our flocks for us.\" As soon as Moses came unto him and told him the story, he said, \"Have no fear! You are now safe from those oppressive folk","28:26":"Said one of the two maidens, \"O My father! Hire him! For, the best one you can hire is the competent, the trustworthy","28:27":"He (the father) said, \"Behold, I am willing to let you marry one of these two daughters of mine on the understanding that you will remain eight pilgrimages (years) in my service. Then if you make it ten, it will be a grace from you. I do not want to impose any hardship on you. God Willing, you will find me righteous in all my dealings","28:28":"He (Moses) said, \"Be that the agreement between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there will be no injustice to me. And Allah be Witness to all that we say.\" (Moses married Shoaib's daughter Zipporah and in time they had two sons)","28:29":"And when Moses had fulfilled his term, and was traveling with his family, he saw a fire on the slope of Mount Toor of Sinai. He said to his family, \"Stay here. Behold, I have seen a fire. I hope to bring you some information from there, or a burning torch, that you may warm yourselves","28:30":"But when he came close to it, he was called from the right side of the valley in the blessed field, from the tree, \"O Moses! Behold! I, verily I am Allah, the Lord of the Worlds","28:31":"(God said), \"Rehearse your supporting power of Truth.\" Moses felt as if the mission assigned to him was like holding a huge dragon, and he retreated hesitating. (See (27:10) 'kannaha jann' -'as if it was a dragon, applies to the living Truth as well as to the great mission). We said, \"O Moses! Draw near (to conviction), and fear not - for, behold, you are secure from harm.\" (7:107-108), (20:17-24), (26:32-3)","28:32":"The Guidance enshrined in your heart will shine unblemished when you present it with confidence. And guard your heart against all fear. Then these two shall be your evidences from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs, (the Divine Truth and your confident presentation). Verily, they are people drifting away from Moral Values","28:33":"Moses said, \"My Lord! I killed a man among them and I am afraid they will kill me","28:34":"And my brother Aaron - he is far better in speech than I am. Send him, therefore, as a helper, so that he might more eloquently bear witness to my speaking the truth. I am afraid that they will accuse me of lying","28:35":"God said, \"We shall strengthen your abilities with your brother, and We will give both of you power that they will not be able to touch you. By Our Commands! You shall triumph, - you two as well as those who follow you","28:36":"But as soon as Moses came to them with Our clear Messages, they said, \"This is a mysteriously fabricated lie. We have never heard such sermon from our ancestors","28:37":"And Moses replied, \"My Lord is best Aware as to who comes with Guidance from Him, and to whom the future belongs. Verily, the oppressors do not attain a happy state of mind","28:38":"Pharaoh said, \"O Chiefs! I did not know that you could have any god other than myself. Well, then, O Haman! Kindle me a fire for baking bricks and then build me a lofty tower so that I may have a look at the god of Moses - although, behold, I deem that he is of the liars","28:39":"Thus Pharaoh and his forces continued to behave with unjust pride in the land - just as they thought that they would never have to appear before Us","28:40":"And so We seized him and his armies, and threw them into the sea. And behold, what happened to those oppressors in the end","28:41":"And We made them leaders, a pattern, of those who take people to the Fire, and no help shall they find on the Resurrection Day","28:42":"In this world We did cause a rejection to follow them, and they shall be among the despised ones on the Day of Resurrection","28:43":"And, indeed, We had given the Scripture to Moses, after We had annihilated several earlier communities, - to give Insight to people, and Guidance and Mercy, that they take heed","28:44":"And (O Prophet) you were not present on the Western slope (of Mount Sinai) when We expounded the Commandments to Moses, nor were you among those who witnessed his times","28:45":"Nay, but between them and you We brought forth many generations, and long was their life-span. And neither did you dwell among the people of Midyan, conveying to them Our Messages. Nay, but We have been sending Messengers","28:46":"And neither were you present on the slope of Mount Sinai when We called Moses. But you are sent as an act of your Lord's Grace, to warn people to whom no Warner has come before you, so that they may reflect. ((32:3), (36:6). Prophet Ishmael, the ancestor of Arabs, cannot be considered a Prophet to them since Children of Ishmael multiplied and inhabited Arabia as the Arab community long after his death. See (2:125) and introduction to Surah 11 Hud","28:47":"Otherwise, if disaster struck them as a result of their own actions, they might say, \"Our Lord! Why did You not send a Messenger to us, that we might have followed Your Revelations and been of the believers","28:48":"And yet, now that the Truth has come to them from Us, they say, \"Why is he not given the like of what Moses was given?\" (The supernatural miracles they had heard about). But, did not the generations before this Revelation reject the Truth of what Moses was given? They used to say, \"Two examples of delusion, supporting each other (Moses and Aaron)! And they went ahead, \"Behold, we refuse to accept either of the two (brothers)","28:49":"Say, \"Produce then, a Book from Allah that would offer better Guidance than either of these two (the Torah and the Qur'an) - and I shall follow it! Do it if you are men of truth","28:50":"And since they cannot respond to this challenge of yours, know that they are only following their desires. And who could be more astray than he who follows his own desire, devoid of Guidance from Allah? For, Allah does not intervene to guide people who displace Reason with desire","28:51":"Now, indeed, We have caused this Word to reach mankind step by step, so that they might take it to their heart. ('Wassalna' embraces 'step by step)","28:52":"As for those whom We have given the Scripture before (and who understand that this Qur'an is a Divine Revelation like the ones before it) come to believe in this one as well","28:53":"And whenever it is conveyed to them, they say, \"We believe in it, for it is the Truth from our Lord. Indeed, even before it we have been of those who submit (to a Supreme Authority)","28:54":"These will receive a twofold reward because they persevere, counter harsh behavior in a kind manner and distribute Our provision of guidance and sustenance among others","28:55":"(Additionally) whenever they hear vain talk of ridicule, they withdraw from it decently and say, \"To us our deeds and to you yours; Peace be upon you, we do not seek to join the ignorant","28:56":"Verily, you cannot guide aright everyone you love, but it is Allah Who guides him who wishes to be guided. And He is best Aware of those who will be rightly guided. (2:272), (4:88)","28:57":"They (the Quraish) say, \"If we were to follow the Guidance to which you invite us, we would be torn away from our land.\" Why - Have We not established for them a Secure Sanctuary, to which are brought all kinds of produce, a provision from Our Presence?

Behold, this might hurt the Prophet, and he would be shy to say so. But Allah is not shy of telling you what is Right. And if you ask something you need from the ladies (the household of the Prophet), ask them from behind the curtain. This is good for your hearts and for their hearts. (Respect of privacy is an essential component of mutual respect). It is not for you to hurt the Messenger, nor that you should ever marry his wives after him. Verily, this would be a great offense in the Sight of Allah.

This is easy and proper, so that they may be recognized and not bothered. Allah is Absolver of imperfections, Merciful","33:60":"Thus it is. If the hypocrites and they in whose hearts is a disease, and the alarmists in the City do not cease, We indeed give you the authoritative mastery over them. Then they will be your neighbors no more than a short while","33:61":"Accursed, they will be seized wherever found and slain one and all. (That is the penalty for men who keep annoying innocent women on the street, assault them or rape them)","33:62":"That was the Way of Allah among those who lived before. And never will you find any change in Allah's Way. (The Divine Laws in the Universe never change, and the Law of Requital never fails to requite)","33:63":"People ask you about the Hour. Say, \"The knowledge of the Hour is with Allah alone. Yet for your purposes, the Hour may be near","33:64":"Verily, Allah rejects those who reject the Truth, and has readied for them a blazing Fire","33:65":"Therein to abide forever, they will find then no patron nor helper","33:66":"On the Day when their faces shall be tossed about in the Fire, they will say, \"Oh, We wish we had obeyed Allah, and obeyed the Messenger","33:67":"And they will say, \"Our Lord!

Yet man, with his free will, is the only one who breaches this trust of compliance. For, verily, he wrongs himself without knowing it. (Haml = Accept or bear and = Betray the trust - Like Haram = Forbiddingly bad and = Sacred)","33:73":"And so it is. (After making the Laws clear, and giving them the free will, Allah holds mankind accountable for their actions).

For them is the protection of forgiveness and honorable provision of mind and body","34:5":"Whereas those who strive against Our Revelations trying to defeat their purpose, theirs will be a suffering of painful anxiety","34:6":"Those who make use of the perceptual and conceptual knowledge that they have been given, see that the Revelation to you (O Prophet) from your Lord, is the Truth. And that it leads to the Path of the Almighty, the Owner of Praise","34:7":"But those who are bent upon denying, say, \"May we show you a man who says that after you are dispersed in dust completely - lo and behold! - You will be created anew","34:8":"Has he invented a lie against Allah or is he a madman?\" Nay, but those who disbelieve in the life to come are wandering in the wilderness of thought and in a profound error","34:9":"Have they not observed the heaven and the earth however little lies open before them, and however much is hidden from them? If We so Willed, We could have caused the earth to swallow them, or caused masses from the sky fall down upon them.

Few of My servants are truly grateful in practice","34:14":"When We decreed death for him (Solomon), nothing showed his death to the Wild Tribes until a creature of the earth ate away the strength he had mustered. When the power base fell, the Wild Tribes rebelled regretting that they should have done it sooner only if they knew the new unjust King.

Historically, ten of the Israelite Tribes also broke away from the Kingdom at that point)","34:15":"The People of Sheba had a homeland that was a marvel indeed, with gardens everywhere on the right and the left (Yemen-Somalia-Abyssinia). \"Enjoy what your Sustainer has provided for you, and render thanks to Him - a goodly land and a Sustainer Absolver of imperfections","34:16":"But they turned away from Divine Values and We sent on them the Flood of the 'Arim' released from water dams. And We turned their Gardens into 'gardens' producing wild bitter fruit, and a thorny Lote-tree here and a tree there","34:17":"This was Our Requital for their ingratitude. Do We ever punish anyone but the ungrateful? (Ingratitude = Refusing to share Allah's bounties in equity. It appears that in the Kingdom of Sheba people were divided into two classes, the very rich and the very poor)","34:18":"And We had set, between them and the towns We had blessed (Syria-Palestine), many oases with townships within sight of one another, and thus We had made traveling easy, \"Travel safely in this land by night or by day","34:19":"But now, their ungrateful attitude was saying, \"Our Lord! Make our journey-stages longer.\" (Make the trade route insecure, unprofitable and deserted). They wronged people and thus harmed themselves.

It is you who set up (yourselves as) rivals against Him.\" Both parties will then be ashamed when they see the Requital. We will put shackles around the necks of all those who rejected the Truth.

So they dismantled their dwellings by their own hands and the hands of the believers.

The widows. Those who have no means of earning their livelihood. The disabled who cannot move around looking for the Bounty of Allah. The homeless son of the street. Those who are on their way to join you, and Those who travel a distance to seek help","59:8":"And it is for the poor refugees who have been expelled from their homelands and their property. And they seek Allah's Bounty and Approval, and support Allah and His Messenger. It is they, they who are true to their faith","59:9":"Also those who resided in the city (Madinah) before them and attained faith. They love those who immigrated to them, and find no hesitation in their hearts in helping them. But rather give them preference over themselves, even though poverty be their own lot.

And if you are attacked, certainly shall we help you.\" But Allah bears witness that they surely are liars","59:12":"For indeed, if they (Bani'n Nadhir) are driven away, they (the hypocrites) will not go forth with them, and if indeed they are attacked they will help not. And even if they try to help them, they will turn their backs in flight, and themselves find no help","59:13":"Nay, you believers arouse a fear in their hearts more intense than even the fear of Allah. This is because they are a people who do not understand (that all strength comes from following Divine Laws)","59:14":"Never will they fight you, even if they form a coalition, other than from within fortified strongholds or from behind walls. Within themselves is great adversity for each other. You may think they are united but their hearts are far apart.
