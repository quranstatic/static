Go you down to a town! You will certainly get there what you want!\" And they were hit by the ignominy and the poverty, and they incurred Allah's wrath.

Do not then suppress the Truth.\" Even then, people learnt from the two that with which they could bring about separation between man and his wife - and they could not harm anyone therewith except by Allah's leave - and they learnt what harmed, and not what benefited, them.

If two men are not available, then one man and two women, you choose from among those present, should bear witness, so that if one of the women retracts, the other stands by her evidence.

Take us out of this town, whose people are oppressors and raise for us from You a guardian and raise for us from You a helper","4:76":"Those who believe fight in Allah's Path; and those who suppress the Truth, fight in the path of the false god. Fight then against those who are friends of the Satan. The Satanic strategy is indeed weak","4:77":"Do you see these people who were asked to wit old their hands and to establish the prayer and pay the zakaat (poor due)? Then, when fighting was ordained for them, a section of these very people started fearing men, as they should fear Allah, or even more! And they said, \"O Lord! Why have you ordained fighting for us? Had you but given us a little more time!\" Say, \"Short is the enjoyment of this world. And the other world is better for him who fears Allah. And you shall not be wronged, even a bit","4:78":"Wherever you are, death will overtake you even if you are within fortified fortresses. And if any good comes to them, they say, \"This is from Allah.\" And if anything bad afflicts them, they say, \"This is from you ?\" Say, \"All things are from Allah.\" And what's the matter with these people that they are unable to understand the statement","4:79":"Whatever good comes to you, it is from Allah. And whatever bad befalls you, it is from you yourself.\" And We have sent you as Messenger to mankind. And Allah is sufficient as Witness","4:80":"Whoever obeys the Messenger, does surely obey Allah. And whoever turns away, We have not sent you as guardian of such persons","4:81":"They declare their obedience. Then, once out of your presence, a section of them pass all night in doing other than what you advise them to do. And Allah records their nocturnal doings. So, leave them alone, and trust Allah! And Allah suffices as Trustee","4:82":"Do they not then ponder over the Qur'aan? And had it been from anybody other than Allah, they would certainly find in it many a contradiction","4:83":"And when there comes to them any matter of peace or fear, they make it public. And had they referred it to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, it would have been properly scrutinized by the investigators among them. And had it not been for Allah's Favour upon you, and His Mercy, you would certainly have followed Satan, save a few of you","4:84":"Fight, then, in Allah's Path. You will be beld responsible for none but you yourself, and exhort the believers. It may be that Allah will contain the power of those who suppress the Truth. And Allah is the strongest in power and the most severe in giving punishment","4:85":"Whoever intercedes in a good cause, for him a share thereof; and whoever intercedes in a bad cause, for him a part thereof. And Allah is the Controller over all things","4:86":"And when you are greeted with a greeting, then return the greeting in a better or similar manner. Indeed, Allah is the Comptroller over all things","4:87":"Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but He. He will certainly gather you together on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. And who can be more truthful in word than Allah","4:88":"What is the matter with you, then, that, on the question of the hypocrites you are divided into two opposing camps? And Allah has turned them back because of what they have earned. Do you wish to guide him whom Allah has sent astray!? And whomsoever Allah sends astray, you shall find no way for him","4:89":"They desire that you should suppress the Truth as they have suppressed it, so that you become all alike. Take not from among them friends, then, until they move out in Allah's Path. Then if they turn back, seize them and kill them wherever you find them.hAnd take not, from among them, anyone, either as a close friend or to help you out in any matter","4:90":"Except those who join a people between whom and you there is a treaty, or who come to you with their minds averse to fighting you or fighting their own people. And had Allah willed, He would have empowered them to fight you. So if they withdraw from you and fight with you not, and offer you peace, then Allah has opened no way for you to act against them","4:91":"You will find others who desire that they should be safe from you and safe from their own people. Whenever they are put to the test, they readily yield to temptations therein. So if they do not withdraw from you, offer you peace and restrain their hands, then seize them and kill them wherever you get hold of them. And against these We have given you a clear authority","4:92":"And it does not behove a believer to kill a believer except by mistake. And whoever kills a believer by mistake, he should free a believing slave, and blood-money should be paid to the deceased's family unless they remit it as charity. If he was from a people hostile to you and was a believer, then the freeing of a believing slave, and if he was from a people, between whom and you there is a convenant, the blood-money should be paid to the deceased's family along with the freeing of a believing slave, and he who cannot find one should fast for two consecutive months in order to seek repentance from Allah. And Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise","4:93":"And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his punishment is to abide forever in Hell. And Allah has sent His wrath and curse on him. And He has prepared for him a severe punishment","4:94":"O you who believe! When you set out in Allah's way, ascertain facts and do not say to any one, who offers you peace, that he is not a believer, seeking benefits of this worldly life. With Allah, on the other hand, there are bounties abundant. You were like this before, when Allah conferred His Grace on you! So ascertain the facts. Allah is indeed aware of what you do","4:95":"Not equal are those among the believers who sit back at home — disabled men excepted — and those who strive in Allah's Path with their wealth and with their persons. Allah has favoured those, who strive with their wealth and with their persons, with higher rank than those who sit back. And Allah has promised the good to both, but Allah has favoured those who strive, over those who sit back, with a great reward","4:96":"Ranks from Him and forgiveness and mercy. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","4:97":"While causing those persons to die who were unjust to their own souls, the angels did indeed ask them, \"Why were you so in there?\" They said, \"We were in a weak position on the earth.\" The angels asked, \"Was not Allah's earth spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?\" These people then would have their abode in Hell, and it is an evil destination","4:98":"Except the weak from among the men, women and children who neither have the means nor can they find a way","4:99":"Allah may then pardon such people. And Allah is Lenient, Forgiving","4:100":"And whoever emigrates in Allah's Path, he will find on the earth many places of refuge and abundance. And whoever leaves home as an emigrant unto Allah and His Messenger, and then death overtakes him, his reward falls due upon Allah. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","4:101":"And when you are on a journey on the earth, no sin upon you if you shorten the prayer out of fear that those who suppress the truth may cause you mischief. Indeed, the suppressors of truth are your open enemy","4:102":"And when you are among them and lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand up with you, taking their arms with them. Then when they have prostrated, let them go to your rear, and let another group who have not prayed come forward and pray with you, being on their guard and taking their arms. Those who suppress the Truth desire that you are off-guard as regards your arms and your property, so that they may then turn upon you in a single decisive swoop. And no blame on you, if you are inconvenienced by rain or if you are ill, that you put off your arms; but be on your guard. Indeed, Allah has prepared a disgraceful punishment for the suppressors of Truth","4:103":"Then when you are due to perform the prayer, remember Allah, standing, sitting and while resting on your sides. Then when the situation for you becomes conducive, offer the prayer properly. Indeed the prayer is ordained for the believers at fixed times. . It is a war-like situation that is envisaged in Verses and above. But, in this Verse , other peace-time situations, like when one is travelling in a public transport, in a non-Islamic country, at the fixed time of the ritual prayer, are also envisaged. Stress is laid here on the performance of the salaah at the time fixed even though one is travelling, say, in a public transport bus. The prayer can be performed on a notional basis, then, just by remembering Allah, without going through the normal procedure for the prayer. This Verse is also the authority for the very ill, bedridden, person to offer his/her salah even while lying down","4:104":"And relent not in pursuing the enemy. If you have suffered, they too have suffered as you have, and you expect from Allah what they do not. And Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise","4:105":"WE have indeed sent down to you (singular) the Book with the Truth so that you decide things among mankind on the basis of what Allah has shown you. And do not side with the treacherous","4:106":"And seek forgiveness of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","4:107":"And argue not on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Indeed, Allah loves not one who is a sinful deceiver","4:108":"They may conceal things from people and not from Allah; for, He is with them when they draw secret schemes, which please Him not. And Allah is in complete control of what they do","4:109":"Here you are those, who plead for them in this worldly life, but who will plead with Allah for them on the Day of Resurrection? Or, who will then be their advocate","4:110":"And he who commits an evil act or wrongs his own self and then seeks Allah's forgiveness, he will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful","4:111":"And he, who commits a sin, commits it only against his own self. And Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise","4:112":"And he who commits a mistake or a sin and then throws the blame therefor on to an innocent, he has indeed burdened himself with slander and manifest sin","4:113":"And had it not been for Allah's Favour upon you and His mercy, a section of themhad certainly planned to mislead you. And they mislead not but their own selves and they can cause you no harm. And Allah has sent down upon you the Book and the Wisdom, and He has taught you what you did not know. And great is Allah's Favour upon you","4:114":"No good in most of their secret talks except for one that would lead to an act of charity, propriety or reconciliation between people. And whoever does this for Allah's pleasure, We will give him a great reward","4:115":"And whoever opposes the Messenger after what guidance has come clearly to him and follows a way other than that of the believers, We will keep him turned to what he himself has turned to and make him burn in hell. And it is an evil destination","4:116":"Indeed, Allah forgives not that partners are set up for Him, and He forgives, whom He wills, any sin besides. And he, who sets up partners to Allah, has indeed strayed far off","4:117":"They invoke none but women instead of Him. And they invoke none but a rebellious Satan","4:118":"Allah has excommunicated him. And he had said, \"I will take (influence) a certain number of Your devotees","4:119":"And I will certainly lead them astray and arouse in them vain desires, and make them slit the ears of the cattle, and make them disfigure Allah's creation.\" And he, who takes the Satan instead of Allah as master, shall surely suffer a manifest loss","4:120":"He makes promises to them and arouses vain desires in them. And the Satan promises them nothing but vain and delusive things","4:121":"Abode of these people shall be Hell, and they shall find no escape from it","4:122":"And as for those who believe and do good deeds, We shall admit them to gardens with rivers flowing underneath, and they will abide therein for ever. Allah's promise is the Truth. And whose statement could be truer than Allah's","4:123":"It will not be in accordance with your wishes and it will not be in accordance with the wishes of the people of the Book. He, who does a wrong, shall be punished for it, and he will find for himself neither a guardian nor anyone to help, besides Allah","4:124":"And such people — as the one, male or female, who does good deeds and is a believer — shall enter the Garden, and they shall not be subjected to even a speck of injustice","4:125":"And who can be better in way of life than he who submits himself entirely to Allah, and is a doer of good, and devotedly follows Abraham's Creed ? And Allah did hold Abraham dear","4:126":"And to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth. And Allah is encircling each and every thing","4:127":"And they seek decrees from you regarding the women. Tell them that Allah has decreed to you about them. And the decrees are those recited unto you, in the Book, regarding the orphaned/helpless women whom you wish to marry without paying what is ordained for them and regarding the weak and oppressed children,h and that you stand up for justice for the orphans. And whatever good you do, Allah would indeed be aware of it","4:128":"And if a woman fears from her husband cruelty or desertion, no blame accrues on either of them, if they effect reconciliation between themselves. And reconciliation is better. And human beings are subject to greed. And if you do good deeds and fear Allah, then Allah is indeed aware of what you do","4:129":"And you are unable to be fairly just between wives, even though you may ardently wish to, but turn you not altogether away so as to keep her, as it were, in suspense. And if you make amends and fear Allah, then Allah is indeed Forgiving, Merciful","4:130":"And if they separate, Allah will make each of them free from want out of His immense resources. And Allah is Immense in resources, Wise","4:131":"And for Allah it is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And We did direct the People of the Book before you, and now We do direct you, to fear Allah.

And if you swerve or turn away, then, indeed, Allah is aware of what you do","4:136":"O you who believe! Believe in Allah, His Messenger, the Book He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Book He had previously sent down. He, who denies Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Hereafter, has gone far astray","4:137":"Indeed, those who believe and then suppress the Truth, and again believe and then suppress the Truth, and then go on suppressing the Truth! Allah will neither be disposed to forgive them nor to guide them to the Right Path","4:138":"Let the hypocrites know that for them is a painful punishment","4:139":"Do they, who take the suppressors of Truth, rather than the believers, as close friends, seek honour from those suppressors of Truth? But, then, all honour does indeed rest with Allah","4:140":"And it is certainly laid down for you in the Book that when you hear Allah's Verses being denied or ridiculed, you should not sit with those people until they enter another topic of talk; otherwise, you shall be like them. Indeed Allah shall gather the hypocrites and the deniers all together in Hell","4:141":"These are they, who wait and watch to see how things shape for you. If there be a victory for you from Allah, they say: \"Were we not with you?\" And if the suppressors of Truth gain a share of success, they say, \"Did we not guard your interests and protect you from the believers.\" Then Allah will judge between you and them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah has not provided a way for the suppressors of Truth to go (triumph) over the believers","4:142":"Indeed, the hypocrites strive to deceive Allah, and it is He, who deceives them!

And he became one of those, doomed.h","5:31":"Then Allah sent a crow digging the earth so as to show him how to dispose of the dead body of his brother. He said, \"Woe to me! Have I not the competence even to be like this crow to dispose of the dead body of my brother?\" And he was ashamed","5:32":"on that ground. We ordained for the Children of Israel that if one killed a person — not in retaliation for killing another person or for spreading mischief on earth — it is as if he/she killed the entire mankind. And one who saved a life, it is as if he/she saved the entire mankind. And certainly Our Messengers came to them with clear signs. Then indeed, thereafter, many of them did commit transgression on the earth","5:33":"The reward for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive to spread mischief on earth is only that they should be killed, or crucified, or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides, or they should be excommunicated. This is, for them, a disgrace in this world, and, in the Hereafter, they shall suffer a grave punishment","5:34":"Except for those who repent before you overpower them. So be aware that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","5:35":"O you who believe! Fear Allah and seek means of approach to Him and struggle in His Path, so that you get success","5:36":"Indeed, if those who suppress the Truth had all that is in the earth, and the like of it besides, to offer as ransom against the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, it shall not be accepted from them. And for them there shall be a painful punishment","5:37":"They will long to go out of the Fire, and they shall find no way out therefrom. And, for them, it is a lasting punishment","5:38":"And cut off the hand each of the man who steals and the woman who steals, as an exemplary punishment from Allah for what they have earned. And Allah is Omnipotent, Wise","5:39":"And he who repents after he has committed his crime and reforms himself, then, indeed, Allah will accept his repentance. And Allah is indeed Forgiving, Merciful","5:40":"Don't you know that to Allah belongs the absolute sovereignty over the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He wills and forgives whom He wills. And Allah has power over all things","5:41":"O Messenger! Let not those make you sad, who are quick in suppressing the Truth from among those who say, with their mouths, \"We believe\" and their hearts do not believe, and from among those who are Jews. They listen to falsehood. They listen to others who do not come to you. They transpose the word after it had been placed in its proper context, saying, \"If you are given this, take it, and if you are not given this, beware!\" And if Allah wills to put anyone to distress and hardship, you can do nothing for him against Allah. Allah does not want to purify the hearts of such people. Disgrace it is for them in this world, and a grave punishment for them in the Hereafter","5:42":"They listen to falsehood. They eat what is forbidden. So if they come to you, judge between them or ignore them. And if you ignore them, they won't do any harm to you. And if you judge, judge between them fairly. Indeed, Allah loves those who are just","5:43":"And how could they make you a judge? And they have the Torah, wherein is Allah's Judgment, and yet they turn away thereafter! And such as these are no believers","5:44":"We did indeed send down the Torah, with guidance and light therein. Therewith, the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah, and the Rabbis and the doctors in religious law, required to guard part of the Book of Allah and be witnesses thereto, judged for the Jews. Therefore fear the people not and fear Me, and do not buy a small benefit in exchange for My Verses/signs.h And they, who judge not by what Allah has sent down, are the suppressors of the Truth","5:45":"And We ordained for them therein that life is for life, and eye for eye, and nose for nose, and ear for ear, and tooth for tooth, and a wound is a retaliation for a wound. But if one foregoes the retaliation by way of charity, it shall be expiation for him. And they, who judge not by what Allah has sent down, are the oppressors","5:46":"And We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming what was before him of the Torah. And We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light, and confirming what was before it of the Torah and guidance and admonition for those who fear Allah","5:47":"And the followers of the Gospel ought to judge by what Allah revealed in it. And they, who judge not by what Allah has sent down, are the transgressors/profligates","5:48":"And We have sent down to you the Book with the truth, to confirm what has come before it of the Book and to act as an authority thereupon. So judge among them by what Allah has sent down, and follow not their vain desires which deviate from the truth that has come to you. For all of you, We have generated social customs and ways of life. And had Allah so willed, He would have made you a single community, but He wanted to test you in what He has given you, so compete with one another in doing good deeds.h To Allah is the return of all of you. He will then explain to you what you differed in","5:49":"And so you do judge among them by what Allah has sent down, and follow not their vain desires, and be cautious of them lest they tempt you away from some part of what Allah has enjoined upon you. If they then turn away, know that it is Allah's Will to afflict them with hardship for some of their sins. And a great number of the people are indeed the transgressors/profligates","5:50":"Is it then that they desire the rule of the times of ignorance? And who is better to rule, for a people who are firm in Faith, than Allah","5:51":"O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians for close, intimate friends.h They are close to one another. And whoever amongst you is close to them, then, indeed he is one of them. Indeed Allah does not guide the wrong-doers","5:52":"And you will see those, in whose hearts is a disease, to be active in their company. They say, \"We fear a turn of fortune afflicting us.\" And it may well be that Allah will bring about victory or such event, by His Will, that they become ashamed of their secret feelings","5:53":"And those who believe say, \"Are these the people who swore intensely by Allah that they were indeed with us? Their deeds have been in vain, and they are doomed","5:54":"O you who believe! If there be any from among you who turns back from his religion, then, in place of such people, Allah will bring a people whom He will love and who will love Him, humble with the believers, stern with those who suppress the Truth. They will strive in Allah's Path and will not fear the criticism of any critic. That is Allah's Favour which He gives to whom He wills. And Allah is Generous, Wise","5:55":"Your only close friends are Allah, His Messenger and those who believe, establish prayers, give charity and bow down in submission to Allah","5:56":"And the one who seeks closeness to Allah, His Messenger and those who believe, may rest assured that it is Allah's group that shall indeed be triumphant","5:57":"O you who believe! Do not consider persons — from among those who were given the Book before you and from among the suppressors of Truth — who take your religion for a mockery and fun, as your close friends. And fear Allah if you do believe","5:58":"And when you make a call for prayer they take it but as a mockery and fun. They do so because they are a people who understand not","5:59":"Say, \"O people of the Book! Do you take vengeance on us for no other reason than that we believe in Allah and in what is sent down to us and in what was sent down before, and [is not a fact] that most of you are transgressors/profligates","5:60":"Say, \"Shall I inform you of a worse retribution than this from Allah? Those whom Allah has cursed and upon whom His wrath has fallen, and those of them whom He made apes and pigs, and those who worshipped the false god — those are the people in a worse position, and further astray from the Right Path","5:61":"And when they came to you, they said, \"We believe\". And they in fact came in suppressing the Truth, and they in fact went out doing the same. And Allah knows what they were hiding","5:62":"And you see many of them vie with one another in sin and hostility, and in their eating of what is unlawful. What they are doing is certainly bad","5:63":"Why did the Rabbis and the Priests not prohibit them from their sinful utterances and from eating unlawful things? What they are bringing about is certainly bad","5:64":"And the Jews say, \"Allah's hand is bound!\" Their hands are bound and they are cursed for what they said. Nay, both His hands are spread out, He expends as He pleases. And what has been sent down to you from your Lord will certainly make many of them more steeped in insolence and suppression of the Truth. And We have put enmity and hatred amongst them until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire for war, Allah extinguished it. And they strive for mischief on earth. And Allah does not love the mischief mongers","5:65":"And if the people of the Book had indeed believed, and feared Allah, We would certainly have cleared their bad deeds from them and We would certainly have made them enter gardens of bliss","5:66":"And had they only stood by the Torah and the Gospel and that which is sent down to them from their Lord, they would certainly have got provision to eat from above them and from beneath their feet. Among them are people who keep to the right course. And what many of them do is bad","5:67":"O Messenger! Deliver what has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not do so, then you have not delivered His Message. And Allah will guard you against the people. Indeed, Allah guides not people that suppress the Truth","5:68":"Say, \"O followers of the Book! You stand on no basis till you stand by the Torah and the Gospel and that which is sent down to you from your Lord.\" And what has been sent down to youh from your Lord will certainly make many of them more steeped in insolence and suppression of the Truth. Grieve not therefore for the people who suppress the Truth","5:69":"Indeed, those who believe, the Jews, the Saabioon and the Christians — whosoever believed in Allah and in the Last Day, and acted righteously — fear then shall overpower them not; nor shall they grieve!h","5:70":"We did take the Covenant of the Children of Israelhand We sent to them Messengers. Whenever a Messenger came to them with what their hearts did not like, he was either contradicted or killed","5:71":"And they thought that there would be no retribution, so they became blind and deaf. Then Allah forgave them, and thereafter too, many of them became blind and deaf. And Allah is watchful over what they do","5:72":"They did certainly suppress the Truth, who said, \"The Messiah, son of Mary, is indeed Allah.\" And the Messiah said, \"O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Whoever indeed associates others with Allah in his worship, then Allah has forbidden to him the Garden, and his abode is the Fire. And there shall be none to help the unjust","5:73":"They did certainly suppress the Truth, who said, \"The third of the Trinity is indeed Allah.\" And there is none worthy of worship but the One Allah, and if they desist not from what they say, a painful punishment shall afflict those among them who suppress the Truth","5:74":"Will they not then turn to Allah in repentance and ask for His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","5:75":"The Messiah, son of Mary, was but a Messenger. Messengers did come and pass away before him. And his mother was a truthful woman. They both used to eat food. See how We make the Verses/signs clear to them. Then see how they are turned away","5:76":"Say, \"Do you worship, besides Allah, that which is incapable of inflicting any harm on you, or conferring any benefit? And Allah — He is the One listening, knowing","5:77":"Say, \"O people of the Book! Commit no unjust excesses in your religion (way of life), and follow not the vain desires of people who went astray before, and who led many astray and went astray from the Right Path.\"h","5:78":"Cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary, were those who suppressed the Truth from among the Children of Israel. That was because they disobeyed and were transgressors","5:79":"They were not forbidding one another from the forbidden things they did. What they did was certainly bad","5:80":"You see many of them being close to those who suppress the Truth. What their sensual selves have sent ahead for them is certainly so bad that Allah is displeased with them. And in punishment shall they abide","5:81":"And had they believed in Allah, in the prophet and in what is sent down to him, they would not have taken them for close friends. But most of them are transgressors/profligates","5:82":"You will certainly find the Jews and the polytheists to be the bitterest people in hostility towards those who believe. And you will certainly find the nearest in friendship to those who believe, to be those who say, \"We are Christians.\" That is because there are priests and monks among them who do not behave proudly","5:83":"And when they listen to what has been sent down upon the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they recognise. They say, \"Our Lord! We believe, so enlist us among those who give witness","5:84":"And why should we not believe in Allah and in that which has come to us of the truth? And we earnestly desire that our Lord admits us to be with the righteous people","5:85":"Allah then would reward them, on account of what they say, gardens, with rivers flowing underneath, to abide therein. And this is the reward of those who do good deeds","5:86":"And those who suppress the Truth and treat Our Verses/signs as lies — they are the dwellers of the Fire","5:87":"O you who believe! Forbid not the good, wholesome things which Allah has made lawful for you, and transgress not! Indeed, Allah loves not those who transgress","5:88":"And eat of the lawful and good, wholesome things that Allah has provided for you, and fear Allah, Whom you believe","5:89":"Allah does not call you to account for anything trivial in your oaths, but He calls you to account for the binding terms of your oaths. The expiation of it, then, is the feeding of ten poor persons with the average food you feed your families with, or their clothing, or the freeing of a neck. And for the one, who cannot afford, three days of fasting. This is the expiation of your oaths when you take them. And guard your oaths! Thus Allah does make clear to you His Verses, so that you may feel grateful","5:90":"O you who believe! Intoxicants, games of chance, animals sacrificed at the altars of idols and divining by arrows are just aspects of an abomination from among Satan's doings. Shun it then, to attain salvation","5:91":"The Satan only desires to cause enmity and hatred in your midst by means of intoxicants and games of chance, and to keep you off remembrance of Allah, and off prayer. Won't you then desist","5:92":"And obey Allah and obey the Messenger and have fear. If you then turn back, know that the responsibility on Our Messenger is but clear conveyance of the divine Message","5:93":"Upon those who believed and did good deeds, there is no sin in what they had eaten earlier, so long as they feared Allah, and believed, and did good deeds. Then they feared Allah and believed. Then they feared Allah and did good work. And Allah loves those who do good work","5:94":"O you who believe! Allah will certainly test you in respect of game within reach of your hands and your lances, that Allah might know who fears Him unseen. A painful punishment then for the one, who transgresses after this","5:95":"O you who believe! Kill not the game while you are in the state of Ihram. And whoever among you kills it intentionally, the penalty is the like of what he killed, from the cattle, as adjudged by two just persons among you, as an offering to be brought to the Kaabah — Or the expiation therefor is the feeding of the poor or commensurate fasting — so that whoever killed the game, may taste the burden of his deed. Allah has forgiven what is past. And whoever does it again, Allah will take retribution from him. And Allah is Omnipotent, Capable to take retribution","5:96":"Lawful to you is the sea game and its food — a provision for you and for the travellers — and the land game is forbidden to you so long as you are in the state of Ihram. And fear Allah, to Whom you shall be gathered","5:97":"Allah has made the sacred house of the Kaabah a symbol for the people to stand by, so also the sacred month, the offerings and the animals with garlands. It is a symbolic recognition that Allah has knowledge of all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and that Allah is aware of all things","5:98":"Know that Allah is severe in punishment, and that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","5:99":"The Messenger's responsibility is but to deliver. And Allah knows what you reveal, and what you conceal","5:100":"Say, \"The impure and the pure are not the same, although many of the the impure things may please you. So, O those endowed with insight, fear Allah to become successful","5:101":"O you who believe! Do not put questions about things, which, if clarified to you, may cause difficulties for you. And if you put questions about them when the Quran is being revealed, they may be clarified to you. Allah has absolved you of any obligation thereon. And Allah is Forgiving, Kind","5:102":"A people before you did ask such questions, and then became suppressors of the Truth, on that account.h","5:103":"Allah has not made any bahirah, saibah, wasilah or ham, but those who suppress the Truth fabricate the lie against Allah. And most of them understand not","5:104":"And when it is said to them, \"Come to what Allah has sent down and to the Messenger\", they say, \"What we found our fathers with, is sufficient for us\". What! Even though their fathers knew nothing and followed not the right guidance","5:105":"O you who believe! You are responsible for your own selves. He who errs cannot hurt you when you are on the right path.To Allah you all are to return, when He will inform you of what you did","5:106":"O you who believe! When death approaches any of you, call to witness among you, at the time of making the will, two just persons from among you, or two from among others than you if you are travelling in the land and death befalls you. Detain the two after the prayer, then, if you are in doubt, they shall both swear by Allah, \"We will not sell it for a price — and even though it is for a relative — and we will not hide the testimony. By Allah, then, certainly, we should be among the sinners","5:107":"Then if it becomes known that they both have been guilty of a sin, two others shall stand up in their place from among those, nearest in kin, who have a rightful claim. Then the two should swear by Allah, \"Certainly our testimony is truer than the testimony of those two, and we have not committed any trespass. We should then indeed be of those who oppress","5:108":"That should make the testimony more transparent. Or else, they may fear rejection of other testimonies after theirs. And fear Allah and listen. And Allah does not guide the transgressing people","5:109":"The day when Allah will assemble the Messengers, then ask them, \"What response did you get?\", they will say, \"We have no knowledge. Indeed! You are the Knower of the unseen things","5:110":"When Allah will say,\"O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My Favour on you and on your mother, when I supported you with the holy Spirit, you spoke to the people in the cradle and as an adult, and when I taught you the Book and the wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel, and when you made out of clay a bird-like figure by My permission, then you breathed into it and it became a bird by My permission, and you healed the blind and the leprous by My permission, and when you brought out the dead by My permission, and when I restrained the children of Israel from you as you came to them with clear signs, but those who suppressed the Truth from among them said, 'This is nothing but pure magic","5:111":"And when I inspired the disciplesto believe in Me and in My Messenger, they said, \"We do believe and bear witness that we do submit","5:112":"When the disciples asked, \"O Jesus, son of Mary! Can your Lord send down to us a table spread with food from heaven?\" He said, \"Fear Allah, if you are believers","5:113":"They said, \"We wish to eat therefrom, satisfy our minds, know that you have indeed told us the truth and be of the witnesses to it","5:114":"Jesus, son of Mary, said, \"O Allah, our Lord! Send down to us from the heaven a table spread with food which should be to us — to the first of us and to the last of us — a festival, and a sign from You. And give us food, and You are the Best of the givers of food","5:115":"Allah said, \"I am indeed going to send it down to you, but then if anyone thereafter suppresses the Truth from amongst you, I will indeed give him such punishment as I have not given to anyone in the worlds","5:116":"And when Allah will say, \"O Jesus, son of Mary! Did you tell mankind to take you and your mother for two gods besides Allah?\" He (Jesus) will say, \"Glory be to You, I couldn't say anything that I had no right to. If I had said it, You would indeed have known it. You know what is in my mind, and I do not know what is in Your mind. You are indeed the Knower of the things unseen","5:117":"I did not tell them anything except what You enjoined me with: 'Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.' And I was a witness over them so long as I remained among them, but when You caused me to die, You were the Guard over them.hAnd You are Witness over all things","5:118":"If You punish them, then indeed they are Your worshippers; and if You forgive them, then indeed You are the Omnipotent, the Wise","5:119":"Allah will say, \"This day, their truthfulness shall benefit the truthful ones. For them are gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them for ever.\" Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Allah. That is the highest success","5:120":"The absolute sovereignty over the heavens and the earth and over what is in them belongs to Allah; and He has power over all things","6:1":"The praise is for Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and made the darknesses and the light. Yet, those who suppress the Truth sit in judgement over the attributes of their Lord","6:2":"He it is Who created you from clay, and then decreed a term. And it is a term denominated with Him. But, then, you are in doubt","6:3":"And it is Allah Who pervades the heavens and the earth. He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn","6:4":"And no sign/Verse has ever come to them, of the signs/Verses of their Lord, from which they have not turned aside","6:5":"They did reject the truth when it came to them. And the details of what they mocked at will soon come to them","6:6":"Do they not see how many a generation We destroyed before them? We have not established you as firmly as We had established them on the earth. And We made the sky pour rain on them in abundance, and We made the rivers flow beneath them. Then We destroyed them on account of their sins and raised up, after them, other generations","6:7":"And even if We had sent to you a book on paper so that they could touch it with their hands, those who suppress the Truth would certainly have said, \"This is nothing but pure magic","6:8":"And they say, \"Why has not an angel been sent down to him?\" And had We sent down an angel, the matter would have certainly been decided then and there, and they would have been given no respite","6:9":"And if We had made him an angel, We would certainly have made him a man, and We would certainly have made their confusion worse confounded","6:10":"And, certainly, Messengers before you were mocked at, but the very thing they mocked at surrounded those who, among them, scoffed","6:11":"Say, \"Travel on earth and then see what end the rejecters met with","6:12":"Ask, \"To whom does all that is in the heavens and the earth belong?\" Say, \"To Allah. He has made mercy an obligatory attribute of Him Himself. He will certainly gather you on the Resurrection Day, wherein there is no doubt. Those, who have lost their souls, believe not","6:13":"And to Him belongs what lives by the night and the day. And He is the One Who hears, the One Who knows","6:14":"Say, \"Shall I take for a wali anyone instead of Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, and Who feeds and is not fed?\" Say, \"I am indeed commanded to be the first among those who submit.\" And be not you, of the polytheists","6:15":"Say, \"I do indeed fear punishment on a dreadful Day, if I disobey my Lord","6:16":"He/she from whom it is averted on that day, Allah surely has shown mercy to him/her. And this is the most manifest success","6:17":"And if Allah afflicts you with some harm, there is none to take it off but He. And if He gives you something good, then He it is Who is able to do anything","6:18":"And He it is Who has Supreme Power over His creatures. And He is the Most Wise, the One Who knows about all things","6:19":"Ask them what thing is the weightiest in testimony? Say, \"Allah! HE is witness between you and me.

Those who have lost their souls — they will not believe","6:21":"And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie about Allah or rejects His Verses/signs? Indeed, the unjust will not be successful","6:22":"And, one day, We shall gather them all together, then ask those who associated others with Allah, \"Where are your associates you surmised","6:23":"They will then be left with no excuse but to say, \"By Allah, our Lord, we were not polytheists","6:24":"See how they would lie against their own selves, and how that which they forged would desert them","6:25":"And of them there are some who come to hear you, and We have put veils over their minds and deafness in their ears, so they do not understand what you tell them. And even if they see every Sign, they will not believe in it. So much so, that when they come to you to argue with you, those, who suppress the Truth, say, \"These are nothing but tales of the ealier people","6:26":"And they prevent others from it and they keep themselves away from it, and they destroy not but their own selves and they perceive not","6:27":"And if you could but see the scene when they would be held over the fire! They would then say, \"Would that we were sent back! We would not then reject the Verses/signs of our Lord and we would be of the believers","6:28":"Nay! What they concealed before would just become manifest to them. And were they to be sent back, they would certainly commit that which they are forbidden, and certainly indeed they are liars","6:29":"And they say, \"There is nothing but our life of this world, and we shall not be resurrected","6:30":"And if you could but see the scene when they would be standing before their Lord! HE will ask, \"Is not this the Truth?\" They will say, \"Yes, and by our Lord!\" HE will say, \"Taste then the punishment for being suppresors of the Truth","6:31":"They surely are doomed, who deny their appointment with Allah. Until, when, all of a sudden, the Hour dawns on them, they say, \"Alas for us that we gave no thought to it!\" And they bear their burdens on their backs. It is evil, what they bear; isn't it","6:32":"And the life of this world is nothing but play and pastime. And, certainly, the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah. Don't you then understand","6:33":"We do know indeed that what they say certainly grieves you. Still, surely, it is not you that they reject, but it is Allah's Verses/signs that the wicked people deny","6:34":"And surely Messengers before you were rejected, but they bore their rejection and persecution with patience, until Our help reached them. And none can change Allah's Words. And, surely, some of the tales of the Messengers have come to you","6:35":"And if their aversion is hard on you, then, if you can, seek an opening deep into the earth or a ladder [link] up into the heavens, and then bring them a sign. And if Allah had so willed, He would certainly have gathered them all on guidance. Be not then of those who are ignorant","6:36":"Only those respond, who hear! And as for the dead, Allah will resurrect them, then to Him they shall be returned","6:37":"And they say, \"Why is a sign not sent down upon him from his Lord?\" Say, \"Allah can indeed send down a sign.\" But most of them would not know it as a sign","6:38":"And there is no creature crawling on earth or bird flying with its two wings, but lives in communities like yours. — We have neglected nothing in the Book. — Then unto their Lord shall they be gathered","6:39":"And they who reject Our Verses/signs are deaf and dumb in darknesses. Allah sends astray whom He wills.

He would then, if He wills, remove the distress, the removal of which you prayed for, and you would then forget the others you worshipped besides Him","6:42":"And certainly We did send down Messengers and Messages to peoples before you. We then seized them with distress and affliction in order that they might humble themselves","6:43":"Then why did they not, when Our punishment came to them, humble themselves? But their hearts hardened and the Satan made what they did, look fair to them","6:44":"Then when they forgot what they had been reminded of, We opened for them the doors of all things. Until, when they were engrossed in rejoicing what they were given, We seized them suddenly. Then it was when they were driven to desperation and despair","6:45":"And the roots of the wicked people were cut off. And all praise to Allah, the Lord of the worlds","6:46":"Say, \"You see, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight, and put seals on your hearts, which god, other than Allah, can restore it to you?\" Look, how We explain the Verses/signs, yet they turn away","6:47":"Say, \"You see, if Allah's punishment were to come to you, suddenly or with due notice, would any but the wicked people be destroyed","6:48":"And We did not send the Messengers but as harbingers of good news and warners. Then those who believe and mend their ways, they shall have no fear, nor shall they grieve","6:49":"And those who reject Our Verses/signs, punishment shall afflict them because they are committing transgression","6:50":"Say, \"I do not say to you, I have Allah's treasures with me, nor do I know the unseen, nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I do not but follow what is revealed to me.\" Say, \"Are the blind and the seeing alike?

Neither are you responsible for anything in their account, nor are they responsible for anything in your account. If you still turn them away, you should be among the wicked people","6:53":"And thus have We tried some of them through others, so that they say, \"Are these the peoplehupon whom Allah has conferred benefits from amongst us?\" Does not Allah know who the grateful are","6:54":"And when those who believe in Our Verses/signs come to you, say, \"Peace on you! Your Lord has made mandatory upon Himself the attribute of mercifulness. So if any of you does a bad thing in ignorance, and thereafter repents and mends his/her ways, then He is indeed Forgiving, Merciful","6:55":"And thus do We explain the Verses/signs in detail to make the way of the guilty manifest","6:56":"Say, \"I am indeed forbidden to worship those, other than Allah, whom you pray to.\" Say, \"I follow not your desires. I should be gone astray otherwise, and I should not be of those who are guided","6:57":"Say, \"I stand on manifest authority from my Lord, and you deny it! I have no power over what you hasten for. The decision is for none but Allah to take. HE tells the truth and He is the Best of the judges","6:58":"Say, \"Had I the power over what you hasten for, the matter between you and me would have certainly been decided. And Allah knows the wicked people","6:59":"And with Him are the keys of the unseen — none knows them but He. And He knows what is there in the land and the sea. And not a leaf falls, but He knows it. And no grain in the darknesses of the earth, or anything green or dry, but it is all recorded in a book manifest","6:60":"And He it is Who takes your souls at night. And He knows what you strive for in the day, then raises you up therein to fulfill an appointed term. Then to Him is your return, when He will inform you of what you had been doing","6:61":"And He is the One Supreme above His subjects, and He sends guardians over you. Until when death comes to one of you, Our Messengers take his/her soul up, and they make no mistake","6:62":"They are then returned to their True Master. Isn't His the Command and isn't He quick in taking account","6:63":"Say, \"Who is it that delivers you from darknesses of the land and the sea when you pray to Him in humility and secrecy, 'If He delivers us from this, we should certainly be of the grateful ones","6:64":"Say, \"Allah delivers you from those and from every distress, but, then, you go and worship others besides Allah","6:65":"Say, \"He has the power to send punishment upon you from above you or from beneath your feet, or to clothe you in sectarian garbs and make some of you taste the hostility of others.\" See how variously do We explain the Verses/signs so that they may understand","6:66":"And your people have declared it to be a lie, and it is the Truth. Say, \"I am not given the responsibility of managing your affairs","6:67":"And you will in time come to know that every information given is based on Truth","6:68":"And when you see people denying and ridiculing Our Verses/signs, withdraw from them until they enter another topic of talk. And if the Satan causes you to forget, then, after remembering the divine directive, sit not in the company of the wicked people","6:69":"And those who fear Allah shall not be responsible for anything in those wicked people's account, but their responsibility it is to remind the wicked people, so that the latter may also fear Allah","6:70":"And leave alone those who have taken their religion (way of life) as just play and pastime, and whom this world's life has deceived. But do remind them with itlest an individual self is given up to destruction for what it has earned. It shall not have, other than Allah, any wali nor an intercessor, and even if it offers all possible ransom, it shall not be accepted from it. These are they who shall be given up to destruction for what they earned. For them will be a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment, because they had been suppressing the Truth","6:71":"Say, \"Shall we pray to someone — other than Allah — who can do us neither good nor harm, and shall we turn back on our heels, after Allah has guided us, like him whom the devils have made to move about perplexed in the earth and who has companions calling him to their guidance?\" Say, \"Indeed, Allah's guidance is the guidance. And we are commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds","6:72":"And that we should establish prayer and fear Him.\" And He it is to Whom you shall be gathered","6:73":"And He it is, as a matter of fact, Who has created the heavens and the earth. And the time He says, 'Be', it is! His word is the truth. And His is the Sovereignty, the day the Trumpet is blown. HE is the Knower of the unseen and the seen. And He is the Wise, the Aware","6:74":"And when Abraham told his father, Azar, \"Do you take idols as gods? I do indeed see you and your people in manifest error","6:75":"And thus did We show to Abraham the Reality of sovereignty over the heavens and the earth so that he was of those, strong in Faith","6:76":"So when the night fell on him, he saw a star. He said, \"This is my Lord.\" But when it set, he said, \"I do not love things that set","6:77":"Then when he saw the moon rising, he said, \"This is my Lord.\" But when it set, he said, \"If my Lord does not guide me, I shall certainly be of the people gone astray","6:78":"Then when he saw the sun rising up, he said, \"This is my Lord. This is the greatest. But when it set, he said, \"O my people! I am indeed absolved of worshipping those, other than Allah, whom you worship","6:79":"I have indeed turned my face wholeheartedly to Him Who has created the heavens and the earth, and I am not of those who worship others besides Allah","6:80":"And his people quarrelled with him. He said, \"Do you quarrel with me about Allah, Who certainly has guided me? And I do not fear those you worship besides Him in anything except what my Lord wills. My Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. Don't you remember","6:81":"And why should I fear those whom you worship besides Allah, when you do not fear that you worship that, besides Allah, for which He has not sent down to you any authority. Then tell me if you do know which of the two parties has a greater claim to security","6:82":"Those who believe, and do not obscure their belief with wickedness, those are they who shall have the security and those are they who are guided","6:83":"And that was Our argument which we gave to Abraham against his people. We raise whom We will in rank. Indeed, your Lord is Wise, Knowledgeable","6:84":"And We gave him Isaac and Jacob. We guided everyone. And, before that, We guided Noah, and of his progeny, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. And thus do We reward those who do good","6:85":"And Zachariya and John and Jesus and Elias, all of them righteous men","6:86":"And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot, and to all of them We gave favours over the worlds","6:87":"And from among their fathers and their progeny and their brethren, We chose some and guided to the Straight Path","6:88":"This is Allah's guidance. He guides thereby whom He wills of His subjects. And if they worship other gods, certainly, what they did would become useless for them","6:89":"They are those whom We gave the Book and the authority and the prophecy. As their peoples suppressed and denied the Truth thereof, We then entrusted it to a people who do not suppress and deny the Truth in it","6:90":"They are those whom Allah had guided. Follow their guidance then! Say, \"I do not ask you for any reward for it. It is the Book of Guidance, to be referred to often, not just for you but for all the worlds","6:91":"And they do not appreciate Allah's unique Majesty and Power as it should be appreciated, when they say, \"Allah has not sent down any revelation upon man.\" Say, \"Who revealed the Book that Moses brought, a light and guidance to men, which you made into sheets you show — while you conceal much — and you were taught what you or your fathers did not know?\" Say, \"Allah!\" Then leave them to play with their vain talk in which the Truth is suppressed and ridiculed","6:92":"And We have sent down this blessed Book, confirming that which is before it, so that you may warn the Mother City and settlements around it. And those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they guard their prayers","6:93":"And who can be more wicked than he who forges a lie against Allah, or says, 'It has been revealed to me' while nothing has been revealed to him, and who says, \"I shall reveal the like of what Allah has revealed\"? And if you could but see the wicked people when they are in the throes of death and the angels stretch out their hands saying, \"Take out your lives! It's time you are recompensed with a contemptible punishment for speaking false things about Allah and for being too proud to accept His Verses/signs","6:94":"And certainly you have come to Us alone just as We had created you the first time. And you have left behind your backs the things which We had given you. And We do not see with you your intercessors about whom you had asserted that they were gods besides Allah for you. Certainly, the ties between you are cut off and what you had been asserting has deserted you","6:95":"Indeed, Allah causes the grain and the date stone to split. He brings forth the living from the dead and He is the One Who brings forth the dead from the living. That One is Allah! How are you then turned away from the Truth","6:96":"He causes the daybreaks. And He has made the night for rest, and the sun and the moon for timekeeping. This is the setting arranged by the Omnipotent, the Knowledgeable","6:97":"And He it is Who has made the stars for you that you may find your way thereby in the darkness of the land and the sea. We have certainly made the Verses/signs plain for people who know","6:98":"And He it is Who has brought you into being from a single human being, then there is for you a domicile and a depository.hWe have certainly made the Verses/signs plain for people who understand","6:99":"And He it is Who sends down water from the sky. Then We bring forth with it every kind of growth. Then We bring forth from it greenery from which We produce grain clustered in ears. And of the palm-tree — of its sheaths — come forth clusters of dates within reach. And gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates, alike and unlike — look at its fruit when it bears fruit and when it ripens. Indeed, there are signs in these things for people who believe","6:100":"And they worship the jinn as associates of Allah, and He created them! And, without knowledge, they falsely attribute sons and daughters to Him. Glorified is He! He is far too high and exalted above what they ascribe to Him","6:101":"The One to bring into being the heavens and the earth! How could He have a son when He has no consort? And He Himself created everything, and He is the One Who knows all things","6:102":"That One is Allah, your Lord! There is no god but He. HE is the Creator of all things, so worship Him! And He is the One Who looks after all things","6:103":"No vision can grasp Him, and He grasps all visions. And He is Aware of the minutest detail","6:104":"Evidences have certainly come to you from your Lord. Whoever then sees the evidences, it is for his own good; and whoever is blind to them, it is to his own detriment! And I am not a guardian over you","6:105":"And thus do We variously explain the Verses/signs so that they say, \"You have repeated [what you had already said before]\" and that We may make it clear to people who know","6:106":"Follow what is revealed to you from your Lord! There is no god but He. And turn away from those who worship others besides Allah","6:107":"Had Allah so willed, they would not have worshipped others besides Him. And We have not appointed you as a caretaker over them. And you are not there to look after all their affairs","6:108":"And do not abuse those whom they pray to, besides Allah, lest they should abuse Allah out of enmity and ignorance. To every people thush We have made their own deeds look fair. Then to their Lord shall be their return when He will inform them of what they used to do","6:109":"And they swear by Allah, with the strongest of their oaths, that if a sign comes to them they would certainly believe therein. Say, \"Signs are only with Allah.\" And what should make you perceive that, when it comes, they will not believe","6:110":"and that We will turn their hearts and their sights away, as they failed to believe in it, first thing after its occurrence, and that We will leave them to wander blindly in their transgression?h","6:111":"And even if We had sent down to them the angels and the dead had spoken to them and We had brought together all things before them, they would not have believed unless Allah willed, but most of them are ignorant","6:112":"And thus did We make shayateen, from among mankind and jinn, hostile to every prophet — they deceive one another with sweet talk. And had your Lord so willed they would not have done it. Leave them then alone with what they fabricate","6:113":"So that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may get inclined to what they fabricate and that they may be well pleased with it and that they may earn what they earn of evil","6:114":"Shall I then seek a judge other than Allah? And He it is Who has revealed to you the Book explained in details. And those whom We have given the Book know that it is, in fact, revealed by your Lord. So be not of those who doubt","6:115":"And the word of your Lord is complete in truth and justice. None can change His words. And He is the One Who listens, the One Who knows","6:116":"And if you (singular in number) obey most of those on the earth, they will lead you astray from Allah's Path. They follow nothing but conjecture and they do nothing but guess","6:117":"It is your Lord, indeed, Who knows who goes astray from His Path. And He it is Who knows those who follow the Guidance","6:118":"Eat then of that on which Allah's name has been mentioned, if you do believe in His Verses/signs","6:119":"And why should you not eat of that on which Allah's name has been mentioned, and He has already made plain for you what He has forbidden — except under compelling circumstances — to you? And, indeed, many do unknowingly lead people astray by their own personal likes and dislikes. Indeed, your Lord it is Who knows those who transgress","6:120":"And desist from committing a sin openly and from secret approaches to it. Indeed, they who earn sin shall be recompensed for what they earned","6:121":"And eat not of that on which Allah's name has not been mentioned, and doing so would indeed be a rebellion against Allah. And the devils do indeed inspire their friends to contend with you. And if you obey them, you shall certainly be those who worship others besides Allah","6:122":"Is he whom We raised from the dead and for whom we made a light by which he walks among the people, like him who is in darkness from which there is no way out? Thus what the suppressors of Truth do has been made to look fair to them","6:123":"And thus have We made, in every human settlement, the biggest of the criminals to plot therein. And they plot not but against their own selves, and they perceive this not","6:124":"And when a Verse/sign comes to them they say, \"We will not believe till we are given the like of what Allah's Messengers are given. Allah knows with whom to place His Message. The criminals shall get disgrace and severe punishment from Allah because they plotted against the divine scheme of things","6:125":"And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his mind for Islam, and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his mind narrow and restricted as though he were ascending up into the sky. Thus does Allah lay disgrace on those who do not believe","6:126":"And thisis the Straight Path of your Lord. WE have certainly explained the Verses/signs plainly for a people who ponder","6:127":"For them, there shall be the home of peace with their Lord, and He will be their Wali by virtue of their deeds","6:128":"And on the Day when He shall gather them all together, \"O assembly of jinn! You did frequent some among mankind.\" And their awliya from among mankind shall say, \"Our Lord! We did benefit one another, and we have reached our destination You fixed for us.\" HE shall say, \"The Fire shall be your abode. You shall dwell therein forever, except as Allah wills. Indeed, your Lord is Wise, Knowledgeable","6:129":"And thus do We make the wrongdoers awliya of one another because of what they earned","6:130":"O assembly of jinn and mankind! Did there not come to you Messengers from amongst you, recounting to you My Verses/signs and warning you of your appointment for this Day?\" They shall say, \"We bear witness against our own selves.\" And the life of this world deceived them, and they shall bear witness against their own selves that they were suppressing the Truth","6:131":"The Messengers were sent because your Lord would not destroy human settlements oppressively, while their inhabitants were unaware","6:132":"And all have ranks according to what they do. And your Lord is not unaware of what they do","6:133":"And your Lord is the Self-sufficient One, Mercy being (one od His) Attributes. If He so wills, He may destroy you, and make whom He wills successors after you, just as He raised you up from the seed of another people","6:134":"Indeed, that which you are promised must come to pass, and you are in no position to prevent it","6:135":"Say, \"O my people! You do your best and I do what I do. You will duly come to know for which of us the final abode will be. Surely, the wicked persons shall not be successful","6:136":"And they assign to Allah a share out of what He has created of tilth and cattle! And they arbitrarily apportion, \"This is for Allah, and this for those whom we worship besides Allah.\" Then what is apportioned for those whom they worship besides Allah, does not reach Allah. And what is apportioned for Allah, reaches those others they worship! Evil is the way they judge","6:137":"And thus those, other than Allah, whom they worship have made killing of their children look fair to most of the polytheists, in order to lead them to their own destruction and cause confusion in their religion. And if Allah had willed, they would not have done it. So leave them and their fabrications alone","6:138":"And they arbitrarily say, \"These cattle and tilth are prohibited. None shall eat them except such as we please.\" And they say there are cattle whose backs are forbidden, and cattle on which they would not mention Allah's name, fabricating a lie against Him. HE shall requite them for what they used to fabricate","6:139":"And they say, \"What is in the wombs of these cattle is especially for our males, and forbidden to our females. And if it be stillborn, then they share therein.\" HE will 'reward' them for their prescriptions. He is indeed Wise, Knowledgeable","6:140":"Doomed surely are they who have killed their children foolishly without knowledge, and have forbidden what Allah has provided for them, fabricating a lie against Allah. They have surely gone astray, and are not those who follow divine Guidance","6:141":"And He it is Who produces gardens, trellised and untrellised, and date palms and seed- produce of which the fruits are of various sorts, and olives and pomegranates, like and unlike. Eat of its fruit when it bears fruit, and pay its dueon the day of harvest, and squander not! Indeed, He loves not the squanderers","6:142":"And of cattle there are those that are beasts of burden and those to be laid down on the ground for slaughter and food. Eat of what Allah has provided for you and follow not the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you an open enemy","6:143":"Of eight cattle in pairs, consider two of sheep and two of goats. Ask them, \"Which ones has He forbidden — the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Inform me, with knowledge, if you are truthful","6:144":"And consider two of camels and two of cows. Ask, \"Which ones has He forbidden — the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Were you witnesses when Allah enjoined this on you? Who, then, can be more unjust than he who, without knowledge, fabricates a lie against Allah, to lead mankind astray? Indeed, Allah does not guide the people who are unjust","6:145":"Say, \"I do not find in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden for anyone to eat except that which has died of itself, or blood poured forth, or flesh of swine — for that indeed is unclean — or that which is a transgression, on which a name other than Allah has been invoked. But then whoever is driven by necessity, without being disobedient or transgressing, then indeed your Lord is Forgiving, Merciful","6:146":"And to those who were Jews We had forbidden every animal having claws. And of oxen and sheep We had forbidden to them the fat of both, except such as was on their backs or in the entrails or what was mixed with bones. This was a punishment We gave them on account of their rebellion, and We are indeed Truthful","6:147":"Then if they deny you, say, \"Your Lord is the Embodiment of vast mercy. And His punishment cannot be averted from the criminals","6:148":"Those, who worship others besides Allah, will say, \"If Allah had willed, we and our fathers would not have worshipped others besides Him, nor would we have forbidden anything.\" Thus did those before them deny until they tasted Our punishment. Say, \"Have you any knowledge that you can put forth for us? You follow nothing but conjecture and you do nothing but guess","6:149":"Say, \"With Allah then is the conclusive argument. And had He so willed, He would certainly have guided you all","6:150":"Say, \"Produce your witnesses who can testify that Allah has forbidden this.\" Then if they testify, do not testify with them. And follow not the desires of those who reject Our Verses/signs and who do not believe in the Hereafter and hold others as equals to their Lord","6:151":"Say, \"Come, I will recite what your Lord has forbidden to you. He has enjoined that you do not worship anything besides Him, that you be good and kind to your parents, that you do not kill your children because of poverty — We provide sustenance for you, and for them — that you do not come near indecencies, whether done openly or in secrecy, and that you do not kill anyone, which act Allah has forbidden, except for the requirements of justice. This He has enjoined you with, that you may understand","6:152":"And approach not the property of the orphan, but in the morally most appropriate manner, until he/she attains maturity. And give full measure and weight, with justice. We do not burden a person beyond one's capacity. And be just when you speak, even if it be to a near and dear one. And fulfill your obligation to Allah. This He has enjoined you with, that you may remember","6:153":"And this then is My Straight Path, so follow it. And follow not the paths that alienate you from His Path. This He has enjoined you with, that you may be pious","6:154":"Also, We gave Moses the complete Book for those who would do good deeds, with details on every thing, and as a guidance and a mercy, so that they should believe that they were scheduled to meet their Lord","6:155":"And We have sent down this Book as a blessing. Follow it then and fear Allah so that mercy is shown to you","6:156":"Lest you say, \"The Book was sent down only to two groups before us, and We were truly unaware of lessons therein","6:157":"Or lest you say, \"If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would certainly have been guided better than they.\" So now, surely, there has come to you a Clarification, Guidance and Mercy from your Lord.Who then is more unjust than he who rejects Allah's Verses/signs, and turns away therefrom? We will repay those who turn away from Our Verses/signs with an evil punishment because of their turning away","6:158":"Are they waiting for nothing but that the angels should come to them or that your Lord should come, or that some of the signs of your Lord should come? The day when some of the signs of your Lord do come, one's belief then shall be of no benefit to anyone who had already not attained faith or earned good points through one's faith before! Say, \"Just you wait! We too are waiting","6:159":"You have indeed no concern with those who divide their religion into sects. Their matter goes to Allah, Who will then tell them what they did","6:160":"One who comes up with a good deed, shall have the credit of ten like it, and one who comes up with an evil deed, shall have the recompense of only the like thereof and they shall not be wronged","6:161":"Say, \"As for me, my Lord has indeed guided me to the Straight Path of the right religion — the creed of Abraham, the upright man; and he was not of those who worship others besides Allah","6:162":"Say, \"Indeed, my prayer, my sacrifice, my life and my death are all for Allah, the Lord of the worlds","6:163":"He has no associate whom I should worship. And this am I commanded with, and I am the first of those who submit","6:164":"Say, \"Shall I seek a lord other than Allah? And He is the Lord of all things! And none earns anything but for one's own self. And no bearer of burden shall bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return. He will then explain to you the things in which you differed","6:165":"And He it is Who has made you His representatives on earth, and raised some of you above others in ranks so that He may test you in what He has given you. Indeed, your Lord is swift in retribution, and He is indeed Forgiving, Merciful","7:1":"Alif Lam Meem Sad","7:2":"A Book sent down upon you — let there be no reservations in your mind on that account — which you may warn thereby.

Little do you remember","7:4":"And in many a human settlement that We have destroyed, Our punishment came to it by night or while its inhabitants were having their midday nap","7:5":"They could say nothing — when Our punishment came to them — but that, \"We were indeed in the wrong","7:6":"Then, surely, We shall question those to whom the divine Message was sent, and, surely, We shall question the Messengers","7:7":"Then, surely, We shall narrate to them with knowledge, and We were never absent","7:8":"And the weight that day shall be the genuine one. Those then whose scale will be heavy, those shall be successful","7:9":"And those whose scale is light, those are they who have caused their own doom because they wronged Our Verses/signs","7:10":"And We did provide for your boarding and lodging on earth, and created in it means of livelihood for you. You give but little thanks","7:11":"And We did create you, then fashioned you, and then We said to the angels, \"Prostrate to Adam.\" They then prostrated, but Iblees did not! He wouldn't be of those who prostrate","7:12":"Allah asked, \"What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?\" Iblees said, \"I am better than he. You created me of fire, and You created him of dust","7:13":"Allah said, \"Down you go then from here! You cannot behave arrogantly here. Get out! You are indeed of those who have belittled themselves","7:14":"Iblees said, \"Grant me respite till the Day they are raised up","7:15":"Allah said, \"You are indeed one of those to whom respite is granted","7:16":"Iblees said, \"Since You have led me astray, I will certainly lie in wait for them in Your Straight Path","7:17":"Then I will certainly come to them from the front and from behind them, and from the right and from the left of them. And You shall not find a great number of them grateful","7:18":"Allah said, \"Get out of here, as one rebuked and expelled! I will certainly fill Hell with you all — you and whoever of them will follow you","7:19":"And O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Garden. Eat whatever you like, and go not near this tree! Otherwise, you will be of the wicked people","7:20":"And the Satan then tempted them both to lay bare to them what had been hidden from them of their carnal desires. And he said, \"Your Lord forbade you from this tree lest you two should become angels or of the immortal beings","7:21":"And he swore to them both, \"I am indeed one of your sincere advisers","7:22":"So he misled them both by deceit. And when they tasted of the tree, their carnal desires became manifest to them, and they both began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden. And their Lord called out to them, \"Did I not forbid you both from that tree and tell you that the Satan is an open enemy to you both","7:23":"They said, \"Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. And if You forgive us not, and have mercy on us not, we shall certainly be of the losers","7:24":"HE said, \"Down you go! Some of you would be inimical to some others. And there is for you in the earth provision for lodging and boarding, for a period of time","7:25":"HE said, \"Therein shall you live, and therein shall you die, and therefrom shall you be raised","7:26":"O Children of Adam! We have certainly sent down to you clothing to hide and keep in control your carnal desires and as a means to adorn yourself with. And the clothing of piety is the one that is better. This is of Allah's Verses/signs for them to remember","7:27":"O Children of Adam! Let not the Satan tempt you just as he did to your parents, causing their expulsion from the Garden and stripping them both of their clothing to expose to them their carnal desires. Indeed, he and his tribe see you from where you cannot see them. We have indeed made the devils to be the awliya of those who believe not","7:28":"And when they commit an indecency they say, \"We found our fathers doing this, and Allah has enjoined it on us.\" Say, \"Allah does indeed not enjoin indecency. Do you say what you know not about Allah","7:29":"Say, \"My Lord has enjoined justice. And you should pray to Him, in complete attention and devotion, at every place of worship, and keep the Religion pure for Him. Just as He brought you into being in the beginning, so shall you return [to life again]","7:30":"Some He guided and some deserved to go astray. They indeed took the devils, instead of Allah, as their awliya, and thought that they were guided","7:31":"O Children of Adam! Be well-dressed, clean and tidy at every place of worship,h and and eat and drink, but indulge not in extravagance. HE does not indeed like those who indulge in extravagance","7:32":"Say, \"Who has prohibited Allah's decorations and the wholesome provisions which He has brought forth for His subjects?\" Say, \"These are for the believers in the life of this world, and exclusively for them, on the Resurrection Day.\" Thus do We make the Verses/signs clear for people who know","7:33":"Say, \"My Lord has prohibited only indecencies, those of them that are apparent as well as those that are concealed, and sin and unjustified rebellion, and that you worship others besides Allah, for which He has not sent down any authority, and that you say about Allah that which you know not","7:34":"And for every community there is an end. So when their end comes, not a moment can they delay it nor advance it","7:35":"O Children of Adam! As and when Messengers come to you from amongst you relating to you My Verses/signs, then on those who take heed and mend themselves, there shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve","7:36":"And as for those who reject Our Verses/signs and arrogantly turn away from them, they will be the dwellers of the Fire and will abide therein forever","7:37":"Who is then more wicked than he who concocts a lie against Allah or rejects His Verses/signs? Such persons get what is destined for them in this life, until, Our Messengers come to them causing them to die and ask, \"Where are those whom you used to invoke and worship besides Allah?\" They would say, \"They have deserted us.\" And they shall bear witness against themselves that they were suppressors of the Truth","7:38":"He will say, \"Enter the Fire among communities of jinn and humans that have passed away before you.\" Every time a community enters, it curses its sister community, until when they all will have reached it, the community that followed shall say with regard to the community that preceded it, \"Our Lord! These led us astray, so give them a double punishment of the Fire.\" He will say, \"It's double for every one, but you know not","7:39":"And the community that preceded will say to the community that followed, \"So you have no preference over us. You taste then the punishment for what you used to earn","7:40":"Indeed, the doors of heaven shall not be opened for those who reject Our Verses/signs and arrogantly turn away from them, nor shall they enter Paradise until the cable [thick rope] passes through the eye of the needle. And thus do We reward the sinners","7:41":"For them shall there be a bed of Hell and over them coverings thereof. And thus do We reward the wicked people","7:42":"And as for those who believe and do good deeds, We burden not anyone beyond one's capacity. They will be the dwellers of Paradise and will abide therein forever","7:43":"And We will remove any ill-feeling they had in their minds, and beneath them the rivers shall flow. And they will say, \"All praise is due to Allah Who guided us to this! And had Allah not guided us we would never have found the way. Messengers of our Lord had certainly brought the Truth. And it shall be announced to them, \"This is the Paradise for you. You have inherited it on account of what you used to do","7:44":"And the dwellers of Paradise will call out to the dwellers of the Fire, \"We have indeed found what our Lord promised us to be true. Have you too found what your Lord promised to be true?\" They will say, \"Yes!\" Then an announcer in between them will announce, \"Allah's curse is on the wicked people","7:45":"On those who hindered people from Allah's Path and sought to distort it. And they believed not in the Hereafter","7:46":"And between the two there shall be a veil. And on the heights there will be men who will recognise all others by their distinguishing features. And they will greet the dwellers of Paradise, \"Peace on you.\" They will not have yet entered it, but will hope to","7:47":"And when their eyes will be turned towards the dwellers of the Fire, they will say, \"Our Lord! Place us not with the wicked people","7:48":"And the dwellers of the heights will call out to men whom they will recognise by their distinguishing features, \"Of no avail were to you the wealth you amassed and the things you took pride in","7:49":"Are these — who were told, 'Enter Paradise! You shall have no fear, nor shall you grieve' — the same about whom you swore that Allah will not bestow mercy on them","7:50":"And the dwellers of the Fire will call out to the dwellers of Paradise, \"Let some water or some of the provisions Allah has given you overflow to us!\" They will say, \"Allah has indeed prohibited them both upon those who suppressed the Truth","7:51":"Who took their religion as just sport and pastime and their worldly life deceived them.\" So today We forget them, as they forgot their appointment for this day and denied Our Verses/signs","7:52":"And certainly We have brought them a Book, which We have explained on the basis of knowledge, and which is a guidance and a mercy for people who believe","7:53":"Are they waiting for it to occur first? On the day it occurs, those who had forgotten about it before, will say, \"Messengers of our Lord had indeed come with the Truth! Are there for us then any intercessors to intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back so that we do things other than what we used to do?\" Indeed they have doomed themselves and that which they concocted has deserted them","7:54":"Surely your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods of time, and Who then ascended the Throne. He brings the night as a cover over the day, the night pursuing the day incessantly. And the sun and the moon and the stars are subservient to His command. Aren't the Creation and the Command His? Blessed is Allah, the Lord of the worlds","7:55":"Invoke your Lord in humility and secrecy. He does not indeed like those who transgress the limits","7:56":"And make no mischief on the earth after its reformation, and invoke Him with fear and hope. Allah's Mercy is ever near those who are good","7:57":"And He it is Who sends the winds heralding the good news of His mercy, until, when it carries a heavily laden cloud, We make it serve as a water-carrier for a dead land. We then send water down on it, and bring out with it all kinds of fruits. Thus shall We raise the dead, may you remember","7:58":"And as for the good land, its vegetation springs forth by the permission of its Lord, and as for the infertile one, its vegetation comes forth but scantily.

They were indeed a blind people","7:65":"And to AAadWe sent their brother Hood. He said, \"O my people! Worship Allah, you have no god other than Him. Will you not then guard yourselves against evil","7:66":"The leaders of those who suppressed the Truth from among his people said, \"We do indeed see you in folly, and we do indeed consider you to be among the liars","7:67":"He said, \"O my people! There is no folly in me, but I am a Messenger of the Lord of the worlds","7:68":"I deliver to you Messages of my Lord and I am a trustworthy adviser to you","7:69":"Does it surprise you that a Reminder has come to you from your Lord through a man, from amongst you, so that he may warn you?

So remember Allah's Graces so that you may succeed","7:70":"They said, \"Have you come to us to make us worship Allah alone and give up what our fathers used to worship? Then, if you are of the truthful ones, bring to us what you threaten us with","7:71":"He said, \"Disgrace and wrath from your Lord have indeed befallen you. Do you argue with me about names which you and your fathers have given, and for which Allah has not sent any authority? Then wait! I am with you, among those who wait","7:72":"We then saved him, and those with him, by Mercy from Us. And We cut off the roots of those who treated Our Verses/signs as lies. And they believed not","7:73":"And to ThamoodhWe sent their brother Salih. He said, \"O my people! Worship Allah, you have no god other than Him. Clear proof indeed has come to you from your Lord: this Allah's she-camel is a sign for you.

You build for yourselves palaces on its plains and carve out houses in the mountains. So remember Allah's Graces, and do not go about making mischief on the earth","7:75":"The leaders of those who behaved arrogantly among his people said to those who believed, among the weak, \"Do you know that Salih is sent by his Lord?\" They said, \"We are indeed believers in what he has been sent with","7:76":"The arrogant ones said, \"We do indeed reject what you believe in","7:77":"Then they hamstrung the she-camel and behaved insolently towards the Command of their Lord.

Nay! You are a people who transgress","7:82":"And the response of his people was but to say, \"Drive them out of your place; they are men who want to cleanse themselves","7:83":"We then saved him and his family, except for his wife; she was of those who remained behind","7:84":"And We rained upon them a rain. Look! What the sinners end up with","7:85":"And to Midian We sent their brother Shu'aib. He said, \"O my people! Worship Allah, you have no god other than Him.

It is better for you if you do believe","7:86":"And do not lie in wait on every path, cajoling away and hindering one who believes in Allah from His way, seeking to make it crooked, complicated or difficult.And remember when you were but few, He increased you in number.

But they denied the Truth! So We seized them because of what they had earned","7:97":"Did those people then feel secure from Our punishment coming to them by night while they slept","7:98":"Or, did they feel secure from Our punishment coming to them in the morning while they played","7:99":"Did they then feel secure from Allah's plan? But none felt secure from Allah's plan except those who were doomed","7:100":"Has it not dawned on those who have inherited the earth from their earlier occupants that if We please, We would punish them for their sins and set a seal on their minds so they wouldn't hear","7:101":"These places of human habitation! We relate to you some of their stories. And their Messengers did come to them with evidences. But they could not believe because, earlier, they had denied ! Allah thus seals the minds of those who suppress the Truth","7:102":"And We found most of them unreliable. And We did indeed find most of them to be dissolute","7:103":"We then, after them, sent Moses with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his chieftains, but they wronged those Signs! See then what end the transgressors met with","7:104":"And Moses said, \"O Pharaoh! I am indeed a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds","7:105":"It is just and proper for me that I say about Allah nothing but the Truth. I have come to you indeed with evidence from your Lord.

Nay! The cause for anything happening to them lay only with Allah, but most of them knew not","7:132":"And they said, \"Whatever be the sign you bring to beguile us with, we will not believe in you","7:133":"We then sent upon them the storm, the locusts, the lice, the frogs and the blood as distinct signs ; but they behaved haughtily and they were a sinning people","7:134":"And when the calamity fell upon them, they said, \"O Moses! Pray for us to your Lord as He has a covenant with you. If you remove the calamity from us, we will certainly believe in you and we will certainly send the children of Israel with you","7:135":"But when We removed the calamity from them for a term within which to fulfil their promise, they broke the promise","7:136":"We then took our revenge from them and drowned them in the sea because they rejected Our signs and paid no heed to them","7:137":"And We leased the lands to the East and to the West of the earth, in which We have placed Our Blessings, to the people deemed to be weak.

Reveal yourself to me so that I may see You.\" He said, \"You cannot see Me, but look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, then will you see Me.\" But when his Lord manifested His glory to the mountain, He made it crumble and Moses fell down in a swoon. Then when he recovered, he said, \"Glory to You! I turn to You in repentence, and I am the first of the believers","7:144":"He said, \"O Moses! I have indeed distinguished you above the people with My Messages and with My speaking to you directly. So hold on to what I give you and be of the grateful ones","7:145":"And We wrote down for him in the tablets, every kind of advice/admonition, and everything in detail. \"So hold on to them firmly and enjoin your people to hold on to the excellence thereof.

This is because they rejected Our Verses/signs and were heedless of them","7:147":"And as for those who reject Our Verses/signs and the meeting of the Hereafter, their deeds have gone in vain. Shall they be rewarded except for what they have done","7:148":"And Moses' people, after he left, made a calf of their ornaments — just a body, which emanated a sound.Could they not see that it did not speak to them nor guide them to any way? They took to it and indulged in wrong-doing","7:149":"And when they repented and saw that they had gone astray, they said, \"Should our Lord show no mercy on us and forgive us not, we shall certainly be of those who are doomed","7:150":"And when Moses returned to his people, in anger and grief, he said, \"What an evil thing you have done after I left! Were you so hasty for the command of your Lord? \" And he threw down the tablets and caught hold of his brother by the head, dragging him towards him. He said, \"Son of my mother! Indeed, the people reckoned me weak and had almost killed me. So make not the enemies gloat over me and do not count me among the wicked people","7:151":"He said, \"My Lord! Forgive me and my brother and admit us to Your Mercy, and You are the Most Merciful","7:152":"Those indeed who took to the calf, wrath from their Lord and disgrace in this world's life shall overtake them, and thus do We recompense the fabricators of lies","7:153":"And your Lord is indeed Forgiving and Merciful to those who do evil deeds, but then repent thereafter and believe","7:154":"And when Moses calmed down, he took up the tablets. And in the inscription thereof, there was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord","7:155":"And Moses chose from his people seventy men for the appointment with Us.hSo when the violent shaking seized them, he said, \"My Lord!

Say, \"The spoils are for Allah and the Messenger. So fear Allah and improve mutual relationships among yourselves. And obey Allah and His Messenger if you do believe","8:2":"The believers are only those whose hearts are moved with fear when Allah is mentioned. And when His Verses/signs are recited to them, it (recitation) strengthens them in faith. And in their Lord do they trust","8:3":"Those who establish proper prayer and spend out of what We have given them","8:4":"These are the real believers. For them are high grades from their Lord, and forgiveness, and good wholesome provisions","8:5":"Likewise, in truth, did your Lord cause you to go forth from your house. And indeed ah section of the believers were against it","8:6":"They disputed with you the truth after what had become clear, as if they were being driven, with their eyes wide open, to death","8:7":"And when Allah promised you that one of the two enemy groups shall be yours, and you preferred that the one not armed should he yours, Allah desired to make manifest the truth of His words and to cut off the root of those who suppress the Truth","8:8":"That He may establish the truth and destroy the falsehood, the wrong-doers' dislike notwithstanding","8:9":"As you sought aid from your Lord, so He answered you, \"I will assist you with waves after waves of a thousand of the angels","8:10":"And Allah did not make it but as a good news, so that your hearts might be at peace thereby. And there is no help except from Allah. Allah is indeed Omnipotent, Wise","8:11":"Whene caused you to be overcome with drowsiness as a means of mental peace from Him and sent down upon you water from the cloud that He might thereby purify you. And He rid you of satanic pollution that He might fortify your hearts, and might steady your footsteps thereby","8:12":"When your Lord revealed to the angels, \"I am with you, so make the believers firm and steady. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who suppress the Truth. Then hit on their necks and cut all fingers off them","8:13":"This is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger. And whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, then, indeed, Allah is severe in punishment","8:14":"This it is, so taste it; and punishment for the suppressors of the Truth is the Fire","8:15":"O you who believe! When you meet the suppressors of the Truth in war, turn not your backs to them","8:16":"And whoever turns his back to them on that day — unless it is only to turn back to fighting or to withdraw to one's own company — then he does indeed incur Allah's wrath, and his abode is Hell. And it is an evil destination","8:17":"Then it was not you who killed them, but it was Allah Who killed them. And it was not you who threw when you threw, but it was Allah Who threw. And He did it to test the believers with a good test from Himself. Indeed, Allah listens, knows","8:18":"Thus it is that Allah undermines the scheme of the suppressors of the Truth","8:19":"If you had sought a decisive judgment, it certainly has then come to you in the form of victory to the believers. And if you desist from waging a war against them henceforth, then that will be good for you. And if you return, We return! And your forces, though numerous, shall avail you nothing. And you should know that Allah is with the believers","8:20":"O you who believe! Obey Allah and His Messenger and turn not away while listening to him","8:21":"And be not like those who said, `We hear', and they did not hear","8:22":"Indeed, the worst moving creatures, in Allah's sight, are the deaf and dumb that understand not","8:23":"And if Allah had known any good in them He would have made them hear, and if He makes them hear they would turn away and contradict","8:24":"O you who believe! Respond to Allah and His Messenger when he calls you to that for which Allah gives you life. And know that Allah intervenes between man and his mind, and that to Him you shall be gathered","8:25":"And beware of a trial which may not afflict only those of you in particular who do wrong. And know that Allah is severe in punishment","8:26":"And remember when you were few, deemed weak in the land, fearing lest people might carry you off by force. Then He sheltered you, strengthened you with His aid and provided you with good things so that you feel grateful","8:27":"O you who believe! Betray not Allah and the Messenger, nor betray your trusts, knowingly","8:28":"And know that your property and your children are a trial, and that, with Allah, there is a magnificent reward","8:29":"O you who believe! If you fear Allah, He will create in you an ability to distinguish between right and wrong and do away with your evil tendencies, and forgive you. And Allah possesses great Grace","8:30":"And those who suppressed the Truth plotted to confine you, kill you or drive you away. They plotted and Allah plotted. And Allah is the best of plotters","8:31":"And when Our Verses/signs are recited to them, they say, \"We have heard. We certainly could, if we pleased, say things like that. These are nothing but fables of the ancients","8:32":"And they said, \"O Allah! If this is the Truth from You, then rain upon us stones from the sky or bring on us a painful punishment","8:33":"But Allah was not going to punish them while you dwelt among them, nor was Allah going to punish them while they may yet ask for forgiveness","8:34":"And why should Allah not punish them when they hinder people from the Sacred Place of Worship and when they cannot be its custodians. Its custodians can only be those who fear Allah, but most of them know not","8:35":"And their prayer before the House is nothing but whistling and clapping. Taste then the punishment; for, you have been suppressing the Truth","8:36":"Indeed, those who suppress the Truth spend their wealth to hinder people from the Path of Allah. And they shall continue to spend it so, till they are overcome with intense regret thereupon. And those, who suppress the Truth, shall be driven together to Hell","8:37":"That Allah might separate the bad from the good, and pile up the bad, one upon another, and then cast them together into Hell. These are the ones that are doomed","8:38":"Tell those who suppress the Truth that if they desist, that which is past shall be forgiven to them. And if they persist, what happened to the ancients is already on record","8:39":"And fight with them until revolt/insurrection stops, and the way of life is restored in its entirety to Allah. Then if they desist, Allah does indeed see what they do","8:40":"And if they turn back, then know that Allah is your Patron — the best Patron and the best One to help","8:41":"And know that whatever booty you get, a fifth of it is for Allah and for the Messenger and for those near and dear, the orphans, the needy and the wayfarer, if you do believe in Allah and in that which We bestowed upon Our Slave on the day right was distinguished from wrong, the day on which the two armies met. And Allah has power over all things","8:42":"The scenario was that you were on the nearer side, and they on the farther side, and the caravan was in the valley down below you. And even if you had planned to attack the caravan, you would certainly have missed the target, so that Allah might accomplish a matter which was to be accomplished — that he would manifestly perish that He wished to perish, and he would manifestly keep alive that He wished to keep alive. And indeed Allah listens, knows","8:43":"Then Allah showed them to you in your dream as few. And if He had shown them to you as many, you would certainly have lost courage and you would have quarrelled over the matter. But Allah acted to set things right. He is indeed aware of what goes on in your minds","8:44":"And then He showed them to you, when you met, as few in your eyes and He made you to appear few in their eyes, in order that Allah brought a matter, which was to be done, to fruition. And to Allah are all matters returned","8:45":"O you who believe! When you face an enemy in battle, be firm, and remember Allah a great deal, so that you may be successful","8:46":"And obey Allah and His Messenger and do not quarrel; for, then, you will lose courage and your power will go away. And be patient! Indeed, Allah is with those who are patient","8:47":"And be not like those who came out of their homes boasting and showing off, and who turned people away from the Path of Allah. And Allah surrounded all that they did","8:48":"And then the Satan made their deeds fair seeming to them, and said, \"No man can overcome you this day, and indeed I am your supporter.\" But when the two armies confronted each other, he turned his back and said, \"I do indeed bear no responsibility for you. I do indeed see what you do not see. I do indeed fear Allah. And Allah is severe in giving punishment","8:49":"The hypocrites and those in whose hearts was a disease said, \"Their religion has deceived them.\" And when anyone places his trust on Allah, then indeed Allah is Omnipotent, Wise","8:50":"And if you could see the angels causing those who suppress the Truth to die, you would see them (angels) smiting their faces and their backs, and saying, \"Taste the torment of the Fire","8:51":"This is because of what your own hands have sent in before. And Allah is not in the least unjust to those whom He created and who ought therefore to obey Him","8:52":"Like Pharaoh's people and those before them: they suppressed the Truth in Allah's Verses/signs, and then Allah seized them for their sins. Allah is indeed strong, severe in punishment","8:53":"That was because Allah has never changed a favour which He has conferred upon a people until they themselves become responsible for any change in it. And because Allah listens, knows","8:54":"Like Pharaoh's people and those before them: they rejected the Verses/signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them on account of their sins and We drowned Pharaoh's people, and they were all unjust","8:55":"Indeed, the worst of the moving creatures, in Allah's sight, are those who suppress the Truth. And then they would not believe","8:56":"Those with whom you had a covenant, and they broke it every time and they did not fear Allah","8:57":"And if you face them in war, make a deterrent example of them for those who would follow them","8:58":"And if you fear treachery on the part of a people, then throw back the covenant to them in an equitable manner. Indeed, Allah does not like the treacherous people","8:59":"And let not those who suppress the Truth think that they will get away. They will certainly not escape","8:60":"And prepare against them what force and means of transport you can muster, to deter thereby the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them, whom you do not know but Allah knows. And whatever thing you spend in Allah's path, it will be paid back to you in full and you shall not be wronged","8:61":"And if they incline towards peace, then incline towards it and trust in Allah. HE does indeed listen, know","8:62":"And if they intend to deceive you, then Allah is indeed sufficient for you. He it is Who strengthened you with His help and with the believers","8:63":"And He united their hearts. Had you (singular) spent all that is in the earth, you could not have united their hearts, but Allah united them. He is indeed Omnipotent, Wise","8:64":"O Prophet! Allah is sufficient for you and for such of the believers that follow you","8:65":"O Prophet! Exhort the believers to fight. If there be twenty of you exercising patience, they shall overcome two hundred; and if there be a hundred of you, they shall overcome a thousand of those who suppress the Truth, because they (the latter) are a people who do not understand","8:66":"For now, Allah has made your burden light, and He knows that there is weakness in you. So if there be a hundred of you exercising patience, they shall overcome two hundred; and if there be a thousand, they shall overcome two thousand by Allah's permission. And Allah is with those who are patient","8:67":"It is not fit for a prophet that he should have captives unless he is firmly established on the earth. You desire to avail goods of this world, while Allah desires for you the Hereafter. And Allah is Omnipotent, Wise","8:68":"Had it not been for an ordinance from Allah already gone forth, surely there would have befallen you a great calamity in what you had taken","8:69":"Eat then of the lawful and good things which you get as windfall or spoils of war. And fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","8:70":"O Prophet! Say to those of the captives who are in your hands, \"If Allah knows there is anything good in your hearts, He will give you better than that which has been taken away from you and He will forgive you. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","8:71":"And if they intend to be unfaithful to you, they were indeed unfaithful towards Allah before, so He gave you power over them. And Allah is Aware, Wise","8:72":"Those indeed who believed and migrated and struggled hard in Allah's path with their property and their lives, and those who gave shelter and help — these are awliya of one another. And as for those who believed but did not migrate, you have no responsibility of being their wali until they migrate. And if they seek aid from you in matters of religion, aid is obligatory on you except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty. And Allah sees what you do","8:73":"And as for those who suppress the Truth, they are the awliya of one another. If you do it not, there will be disorder on earth and great discord","8:74":"And as for those who believed and migrated and struggled hard in Allah's path, and those who gave shelter and help, those are the true believers. They shall have forgiveness and honourable provision","8:75":"And as for those who believed afterwards and migrated and struggled hard along with you, they are of you. And blood relatives are nearer to one another in Allah's Record. Allah does indeed know all things","9:1":"Abrogation of any obligation, by Allah and His Messenger, under any treaty you made with any polytheists.h","9:2":"So travel freely on earth for four months and know that you cannot frustrate Allah and that Allah will bring disgrace to those who suppress the Truth","9:3":"And a proclamation from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the day of the great pilgrimage that Allah and His Messenger are free from any contractual obligations to the idolaters. If you then repent, it will be better for you, and if you turn away, then know that you cannot frustrate Allah. And pronounce painful punishment to those who suppress the Truth","9:4":"But as for those of the polytheists with whom you have a treaty, then they have not failed you in anything and have not backed up any one against you, fulfill their treaty to the end of its term. Indeed, Allah loves those who fear Him and do righteous things","9:5":"Then when the prohibited months pass away, kill the idolaters wherever you find them, seize and besiege them and lie in wait for them at every place for ambush. Then if theyh repent, establish proper prayer and give charity, leave their way free to them. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","9:6":"And if any of the idolaters seeks protection from you, grant him protection till he hears Allah's Word, then take him to his place of safety. It is so ordained because they are a people who do not know","9:7":"How can there be a treaty for the polytheists with Allah and with His Messenger except for those with whom you made a treaty at the Sacred Place of Worship? Then, as long as they are true to you, be true to them. Allah does indeed love those who fear Him and do righteous deeds","9:8":"And how can there be a treaty when, if they prevail against you they would not heed ties of relationship with you, or those of a covenant. They please you with their mouths while their hearts are averse. And most of them are corrupt","9:9":"They have traded Allah's Verses/signs for a small price and then they turn people away from His Path. What they do is certainly bad","9:10":"They do not heed ties of relationship with a believer, or those of a covenant. And these are the hostile ones","9:11":"Then if they repent, establish proper prayer and give charity, they are your brethren in faith. And We make the Verses/signs clear for people that are knowledgeable","9:12":"And if they break their terms after their covenant and taunt your religion, then fight the leading lights of the suppression of Truth — the terms are nothing to them, indeed — so that they may desist","9:13":"Will you not fight a people, who broke their terms of agreement and tried hard for expulsion of the Messenger and attacked you first!? Are you afraid of them? But Allah it is Who has the right to be afraid of, if you do believe","9:14":"Fight them! Allah will punish them by your hands, bring them to disgrace and assist you against them. And He will heal the hearts of a believing people","9:15":"And remove the anguish of their hearts. And Allah grants pardon to whom He wills. And Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:16":"Do you think that you will be spared before Allah has known those of you who have struggled hard in Allah's Path and have not taken any sanctuary besides Allah, His Messenger and the believers? And Allah is aware of what you do","9:17":"The idolaters cannot be maintainers of the places for worshipping Allah while bearing witness against themselves to suppression of the Truth. These it is who have nullified their deeds, and in the Fire shall they abide","9:18":"Only he shall visit and maintain the places for worshipping Allah who believes in Allah and the Last Day, establishes proper prayer, gives charity and fears none but Allah. These it is who are among those on right guidance","9:19":"Do you consider serving drinks to the pilgrims and maintaining the Sacred Place of Worship like the deed of one who believes in Allah and the Last Day and strives hard in Allah's Path? They are not equal in Allah's sight. And Allah does not guide the people who do wrong","9:20":"Those that believed and migrated, and strove hard in Allah's Path with their wealth and their lives, are higher in rank in Allah's sight. And those are the achievers","9:21":"Their Lord gives them good news of His mercy and pleasure and of gardens wherein there shall be everlasting blessings for them","9:22":"They shall live therein for ever. Indeed, Allah has a great reward with Him","9:23":"O you who believe! Do not take your fathers and your brothers as awliya if they love suppression of the Truth more than faith in the Truth. And those of you who take them as awliya, those it is that do wrong","9:24":"Say, \"If your fathers and your sons and your brethren and your mates and your kinsfolk and property which you have acquired, and the trade — slackness of which you fear — and dwellings which you like, are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger and striving in His Path, then wait till Allah manifests His command. And Allah does not guide the corrupt people","9:25":"Certainly Allah helped you in many battlefields and on the day of Hunain, when your being in great numbers pleased you, but they availed you nothing and the earth, vast as it is, narrowed upon you. Then you turned back retreating","9:26":"Then Allah caused His Messenger and the believers to be calm and He sent down forces you did not see and He punished those who suppressed the Truth. And that is the recompense for the suppressors of the Truth","9:27":"Then, after that, Allah pardons whom He wills. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","9:28":"O you who believe! The polytheists are nothing but pollution. So they shall not approach the Sacred Place of Worship after this year. And if you fear poverty then Allah will enrich you out of His grace if He wills. Indeed, Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:29":"Fight those who do not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor prohibit what Allah and His Messenger have prohibited, and fight those people of the Book, who do not follow the Religion of the Truth, until they willingly pay tax as subjects","9:30":"And the Jews say, \"Uzayr is the son of Allah.\" And the Christians say, \"The Messiah is the son of Allah.\" These are their oral sayings. They imitate the saying of those who suppressed the Truth before. May Allah destroy them; how deluded are they","9:31":"They have taken their rabbis and their priests and the Messiah, son of Mary, for lords besides Allah. And they were not enjoined but that they have none but One Allah to worship. There is no god but He. HE is too high in glory, above what they worship besides Him","9:32":"They wish to put out Allah's light with their mouths, and Allah refuses to consent to anything but to perfect His light, even though the suppressors of the Truth are averse","9:33":"HE it is Who sent His Messenger with guidance and the Religion (Way of Life) of the Truth, that He might cause it to prevail over all religions, even though the polytheists are averse","9:34":"O you who believe! Indeed, many of the rabbis and the priests eat away people's property falsely, and turn them away from Allah's Path.h And to those, who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it in Allah's Path, announce a painful punishment","9:35":"On the day when ithshall be heated hot in the fire of hell, then their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded with it. This is what you hoarded up for yourselves, therefore taste what you hoarded","9:36":"Indeed, since the day when Allah created the heavens and the earth, the number of months recorded with Allah is twelve, of which four are sacred.That is the established way. So, commit no wrong in this regard and fight the polytheists in the same total way as they fight you. And know that Allah is with those who fear Him and do righteous things","9:37":"The intercalation in a calendar is only an addition to the suppression of the Truth, wherewith the suppressors are led astray. They treat a month as non-sacred during one year and make it sacred in another to make up the number of months that Allah has made sacred. Thus do they then violate the sanctity of what Allah has made sacred! The evil of their deeds is made to seem fair to them. And Allah does not guide the people who suppress the Truth","9:38":"O you who believe! What is the matter with you that when you are asked to set out in Allah's Path, you cling heavily to the earth? Do you prefer this life to the Hereafter when the provisions of this life count for nothing but little in the Hereafter","9:39":"If set you out not, He will punish you with a painful punishment and replace you with another people, and you can do Him no harm! And Allah has power over all things","9:40":"If you help him not, Allah did certainly help him when those who suppressed the Truth expelled him. He was one of the two in the cave when he said to his companion, \"Grieve not, Allah is indeed with us.\" Then Allah caused him to be calm and peaceful and strengthened him with armies you couldn't see. And He lowered the word of those who suppressed the Truth and raised the word of Allah high. And Allah is Omnipotent, Wise","9:41":"Set out light and heavy, and strive hard in Allah's Path with your property and your persons! This is better for you, if you would know","9:42":"Had it been a near expedition and a short journey, they would certainly have followed you, but the long journey was too much for them. And they swear by Allah, \"If only we could, we would certainly have set out with you.\" They are killing their own souls, and Allah knows for certain that they are lying","9:43":"May Allah pardon you (the Prophet)! Why did you exempt them before it became clear to you as to who were speaking the truth and you knew who the liars were","9:44":"Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day do not ask you to exempt them from exerting themselves in Allah's Path with their wealth and their persons. And Allah knows those who guard against evil","9:45":"Only those, who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day, ask you for exemption and their hearts are in doubt. And they waver in their doubts","9:46":"And if they had really intended to set out, they would certainly have prepared for it. But Allah did not like them proceeding, so He held them back. And they were told to sit back with those who sit back","9:47":"Had they been out in your midst, they would have added nothing but corruption in your ranks, and they would certainly have been active seeking dissension amongst you. And among you there are those who would listen to them. And Allah is aware of the wrong-doers","9:48":"They certainly sought dissension before, and upset matters for you, until the truth came and Allah's commandment prevailed, despite their dislike","9:49":"And among them, there is one who says, \"Allow me and try me not.\" Have they not already failed in the trial? And Hell does indeed encompass those who suppress the Truth","9:50":"If anything good comes your way, it grieves them. And if hardship afflicts you, they say, \"Certainly, it was to our good that we had taken our affairs into our own hands beforehand.\" And they turn back happy","9:51":"Say, \"Nothing afflicts us save what Allah has ordained for us. He is our Patron.\" And on Allah then let the believers put their trust","9:52":"Say, \"Do you expect anything but either of two good thingsappening to us? And for you we expect punishment from Allah Himself or by our hands. So wait; we too will wait with you","9:53":"Say, \"Whether you make the contribution willingly or unwillingly, it shall not be accepted from you. Indeed, you are a people working against Allah's commandments","9:54":"And nothing prevents their contributions being accepted from them, except that they disbelieve in Allah and in His Messenger. And they do not come to prayer but sluggishly, and they do not contribute but unwillingly","9:55":"Let not their wealth and their children then impress you. Allah wishes only to punish them with these, in this life, and to cause their souls to depart while they suppress the Truth","9:56":"And they swear by Allah that they are indeed with you. And they are not with you, but they are a people who are scared","9:57":"If they could find a refuge or caves or a place to go to, they would certainly have rushed thereto","9:58":"And among them are those who blame you for misuse of the welfare funds. If they are given anything from it they are pleased. And if they are not given anything from it, they are indignant","9:59":"And if only they were content with what Allah and His Messenger gave them! And had they only said, \"Allah is sufficient for us. Allah and His Messenger will give us out of His grace. To Allah indeed we do turn in hope and humility","9:60":"The Sadaqaatare to be spent only for the poor, the needy, the administrators over them, for those whose hearts are to be reconciled, the captives, those in debts, in the way of Allah and for the wayfarer. It's a mandatory ordinance from Allah. And Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:61":"And among them are those who hurt the Prophet and say, \"He is all ear.\" Say, \"His ear ish for what is good for you. He believes in Allah and believes those who believe and is a mercy for those of you who believe.\" And for those who hurt the Messenger of Allah, a painful punishment","9:62":"They swear to you by Allah, so that they might thereby please you! Allah — and His Messenger — has a greater right that they should please Him, if they do believe","9:63":"Do they not know that he, who opposes Allah and His Messenger, shall surely have the fire of Hell to abide in? That is the great disgrace","9:64":"The hypocrites fear lest a chapter of the Qur'aan should be sent down to them telling them plainly of what is in their hearts. Say, \"Mock you may ! Allah will indeed bring out what you fear","9:65":"And if you should question them, they would certainly say, \"We were just passing our time with idle talk.\" Say, \"Was it at Allah and His Verses and His Messenger that you mocked","9:66":"Make no excuses. You have resorted to suppression of the Truth indeed after you had registered your belief. If We do pardon a section of you, We do punish another because they are sinners","9:67":"The hypocritical men and the hypocritical women are all alike. They enjoin evil and forbid good and wit old their hands from doing good. They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them. Indeed these — the hypocrites — are the rebels","9:68":"Allah has promised to the hypocritical men, the hypocritical women and the suppressors of the Truth, the fire of Hell to abide therein. It is enough for them. And Allah has cursed them. And they shall have lasting punishment","9:69":"Like those before you; they were stronger than you in power and more abundant in wealth and children, and they enjoyed their lot. And you have enjoyed your lot as those before you enjoyed their lot. And you indulged in vain talk like they did. Those it is that lost their deeds in this world and in the other. And those are the ones that are doomed","9:70":"Has not the information about those before them come to them — of the people of Noah, AAad and Thamood, the people of Abraham, the dwellers of Madian and the overturned cities [of the people of Lot]? Their Messengers came to them with clear Messages. And it was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves","9:71":"And the believing men and the believing women have close friendly relations with one another. They enjoin good and forbid evil, establish proper prayers, give charity and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah will be merciful to them. Allah is indeed Omnipotent, Wise","9:72":"Allah has promised to the believing men and the believing women gardens, beneath which rivers flow. They will live therein in well-furnished houses built within gardens of perpetual abode. And the best thing there will be Allah being well-pleased with them. That then is the highest success","9:73":"O Prophet! Wage a struggle against the suppressors of the Truth and the hypocrites and be severe on them. And their abode is Hell, and it is the worst destination","9:74":"They swear by Allah that they did not utter, and certainly they did utter, the word signifying suppression of the Truth. And they suppressed the Truth after they had declared their faith in Islam. And they intended to do what they could not. And they avenged not except for this that Allah and His Messenger enriched them out of His grace.Now if they repent, it will be good for them. And if they turn back to their evil ways, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and in the Hereafter. And they shall have none to be close to or to help them on earth","9:75":"And there are those of them who sought a covenant with Allah, \"If He gives us out of His grace, we will certainly subscribe to the Welfare Fund, and we will certainly be of those who do good deeds","9:76":"But when He gave them out of His grace, they became miserly with it and they turned back and withdrew","9:77":"So He made hypocrisy to follow them in their hearts till the Day when they shall meet Him because they broke their covenant with Allah and because they lied","9:78":"Do they not know that Allah knows their hidden thoughts and their secret counsels, and that Allah is the great Knower of the unseen things","9:79":"As for those who criticise and scoff at the believers who obediently contribute to the Welfare Fund, and at the believers who find nothing to give but their earnings, Allah scoffs at such scoffers, and they shall have a painful punishment","9:80":"Whether you ask forgiveness for them or not — and even if you ask forgiveness seventy times for them — Allah will forgive them not! That is because they suppress the Reality of Allah and His Messenger. And Allah does not guide the people who rebel against Allah's commandments","9:81":"Those that remained back were pleased with their sitting back against Allah's Messenger and they were averse to striving in Allah's Path with their wealth and their lives. And they said, \"Do not travel in the heat.\" Say, \"The Hell fire is the most severe in heat, if only they could understand","9:82":"They shall laugh little then and weep more as a consequence of what they earned","9:83":"Then if Allah brings you back to any section of them and they ask your permission to go out on an expedition, say, \"Never shall you go out with me and never shall you fight an enemy with me. You were indeed content to stay put the first time, stay put now too with those who stay behind","9:84":"And never offer prayer for any one of them who dies, and never stand by his grave. They did indeed suppress the Reality of Allah and His Messenger. And they shall die in a state of rebellion against Allah's commandments","9:85":"And let not their wealth and their children impress you. Allah only wishes to punish them with these in this world and to cause their souls to depart while they indulge in suppression of the Truth","9:86":"And when a Qur'aanic Chapter is revealed, exhorting people to believe in Allah and engage themselves in righteous struggle along with His Messenger, those with means plead with you and say, \"Grant us leave to be with those who stay back","9:87":"They chose to be with those back home, and a seal is set on their hearts so they do not understand","9:88":"But the Messenger and those who believe with him engage themselves in righteous struggle with their wealth and their lives. And for those certainly, are the good things. And those it is that succeed","9:89":"Allah has prepared for them gardens, beneath which rivers flow, wherein to live. That is the highest success","9:90":"And there came to you those from among the Bedouins who had excuses to offer for exempting them from joining the expedition.

A painful punishment shall afflict those of them who suppressed the Truth","9:91":"There is no blame on the weak, the sick, or on those who do not find the means to spend for the expedition, so long as they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger. No ground to blame the righteous people. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","9:92":"And there is no blame on those who when they came to you to equip them for the expedition, you said, \"I find no means to equip you.\" They went back and their eyes welled up with tears for grief at not finding the means to bear the expenses for the expedition","9:93":"The blame lies only on those who ask you to grant them leave despite being rich. They chose to be with those staying back home. And Allah has set a seal upon their hearts so they do not know","9:94":"They will come up to you with excuses when you go back to them. Say, \"Give no excuses, we won't believe you! Allah has already informed us about you. And Allah and His Messenger will watch your deeds. Then you shall be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the seen. Then He will inform you of what you had been doing","9:95":"They will swear to you by Allah when you return to them, in order that you take no action against them. Do leave them alone! They are indeed pollution. And their abode is Hell — a retribution for what they earned","9:96":"They will swear to you in order that you may be pleased with them. And even if you are pleased with them, Allah is indeed not pleased with the people who rebel against Allah's commandments","9:97":"The Bedouin Arabs are more involved in suppression of the Truth and in hypocrisy, and more disposed not to know the laws that Allah has revealed to His Messenger. And Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:98":"And among the Bedouin Arabs there are those who take what they spend [in Allah's way] as an imposition, and they wait for turns in fortune for you. But it is upon them that the evil turn shall befall. And Allah listens, knows","9:99":"And among the Bedouin Arabs there are those who believe in Allah and the Hereafter and take what they spend as means of nearness with Allah and blessings of the Messenger. Surely it shall be the means of nearness for them. Allah will admit them to His Mercy. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","9:100":"And Allah is pleased with the first and the foremost of those who migrated and with those who gave shelter, and with those who followed them in goodness. And they are pleased with Him. And He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein to live for ever. That is the highest success","9:101":"And some of the Bedouins around you are hypocrites, and so are some residents of Medina. They are insolent in hypocrisy. You do not know them; We know them. Twice shall We punish them. And then will they be brought back for the highest punishment","9:102":"And there are others who have confessed that they were at fault. They have mingled a good deed with a bad one. Allah may pardon them. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","9:103":"Take a fine as sadaqa from them to cleanse and purify them thereby, and pray for them! Your prayer does indeed give them peace of mind. And Allah listens, knows","9:104":"Do they not know that it is Allah Who accepts repentance from His subjectsh and takes the sadaqaat, and that Allah is the Acceptor of repentance, the Merciful","9:105":"And say, \"Go on, do your deeds! Allah, His Messenger and the believers will watch your deeds. And you shall be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen. Then He will inform you of what you did","9:106":"And there are others whose cases are deferred for Allah's decree. He may punish them or He may pardon them. And Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:107":"And those who established a masjid to cause harm and for suppression of Truth and to cause disunion among the believers and to serve as a base for him who made war against Allah and His Messenger before. And they will certainly swear, \"Our intentions were nothing but good.\" And Allah bears witness that they are most surely liars","9:108":"Never should you stand in it! Certainly the masjid founded on piety from the very first day is more deserving that you stand therein. In it are men who love to be pure and clean. And Allah loves those who get themselves purified and cleaned","9:109":"Who is better then: the one who lays his foundation on fear of Allah and His good pleasure, or the one who lays his foundation on the brink of a crumbling hollowed bank, and which crumbles down with him into the fire of Hell ? And Allah does not guide the people who deliberately do wrong, unjust things","9:110":"This structure which they have built will not diminish the doubt in their hearts, unless their hearts get cut into pieces. And Allah is Knowledgeable, Wise","9:111":"Indeed, Allah has bought from the believers their lives and their property for this, that they shall have the Paradise. They fight in Allah's Path, so they kill and get killed. It is a promise which He has bound Himself to, in the Torah, the Gospel and the Qur'aan. And who can be more faithful to one's promise than Allah? So rejoice at the bargain you have struck; for, that is the highest success","9:112":"And give this good news to those who repent, obey, praise Allah, fast, bow down and prostrate to Him, enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and, abide by Allah's laws","9:113":"It does not behove the Prophet and those who believe that they should ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they are near relatives, after it has become clear to them that they would be inmates of the flaming Fire","9:114":"And Abraham asking forgiveness for his father was only because of to a promise which the former had made to the latter. But when it became clear to him (Abraham) that he (father) was an enemy of Allah, he disassociated from his father. Abraham was indeed very tender- hearted, kind","9:115":"Allah would never lead a people astray after guiding them to His Straight Path until He makes clear to them what they should guard against. Allah does indeed know all things","9:116":"Allah does indeed hold the absolute sovereignty over the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death. And there is none, other than Allah, to patronise and help you","9:117":"Certainly has Allah pardoned the Prophet, the refugees and the helpers — those who followed him in the hour of need, after the hearts of a section of them were about to deviate and He pardoned them. He is indeed Kind, Merciful to them","9:118":"And He pardoned the threewho were left behind, whose cases were deferred until the earth, vast though it is, became straitened unto them and their own selves became straitened to them. And they knew it for certain that there was no refuge from Allah but unto Him. Then He pardoned them that they might repent. Indeed, Allah is the One Who forgives, the One Who is Merciful","9:119":"O you who believe! Fear Allah and be on the side of the righteous ones","9:120":"It did not behove the inhabitants of Medina, and those around them of the Bedouins, to lag behind Allah's Messenger, nor to prefer their own selves over his. Because, no thirst, fatigue or hunger in Allah's way afflicts them, nor do they tread a path that enrages the suppressors of the Truth, nor do they attain from the enemy an attainment, but a good work is credited to their account therefor. Allah does indeed not allow the reward of good people to go waste","9:121":"And they spend not a spending, small or big, and they traverse not a valley, but it is credited to their account for Allah to reward them with the best of what they have done","9:122":"And the believers cannot move out, all of them, at one time. Then why should not a group from among every section move out to get deeper understanding of the Religion, so that they may warn their people when they come back to them to be pious","9:123":"O you who believe! Fight those of the suppressors of Truth who are near to you and they should find you stern and firm. And know that Allah is with those who fear Him","9:124":"And whenever a Chapter is revealed, there are some of them who say, \"Has it strengthened the faith of anyone amongst you?\" It has indeed strengthened the faith of those who believe, and they rejoice","9:125":"And as for those in whose hearts is a disease, it adds dirt to their dirt. And they die as suppressors of the Truth","9:126":"Do they not see that they are tried once or twice every year? Yet they repent not, nor do they take heed","9:127":"And whenever a Chapter is revealed, they cast glances at one another, \"Does any one see you?\" Then they leave. It is Allah Who has left their hearts because they are a people who do not understand","9:128":"Certainly, a Messenger has come to you from among yourselves. Solicitous of you, your distress is disturbing to him. To the believers he is compassionate, merciful","9:129":"Yet, if they turn away, say, \"Allah is enough for me; there is no god but He. On Him I do place my trust. And He is Lord of the Mighty Throne","10:1":"Alif Lam Ra. These are Verses of the Book of Wisdom","10:2":"Is it a matter to wonder at for the people that We revealed to a man from among themselves that he should warn the people and give good news to those who believe that there shall be a truly secure position for them with their Lord? The suppressors of the Truth say, \"This man is clearly indeed a magician","10:3":"Indeed, Allah, your Lord, is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods in time, then ascended to the Throne, assuming absolute command. No intercessor can dare intercede except after His permission. That is Allah, your Lord; so worship Him! Would you not then take heed","10:4":"To Him is your return all together — a promise of Allah in truth. He originates creation, and then He recreates it so that He may justly recompense those who believe and do good deeds. And as for those who suppress the Truth, they shall have boiling water to drink and shall suffer a painful punishment for their suppression of the Truth","10:5":"He it is Who made the sun a source of light and the moon a light, and ordained for it phases that you might count years and keep accounts. Allah did not create all that but on purpose. He explains the Verses/signs for people who know","10:6":"Indeed, in the variation of the night and the day, and in what Allah has created in the heavens and the earth, there are signs for people who fear Him.h","10:7":"Indeed, those who do not expect to meet Us and are pleased with this world's life and are content with it, and those who are heedless of Our Verses/signs","10:8":"Their abode is the Fire because of what they earned","10:9":"Indeed, those who believe and do good deeds, their Lord shall guide them by their faith. There shall flow from beneath them rivers in gardens of bliss","10:10":"Their call in it shall be, `Glory to You, O Allah!' and their greeting in it shall be, `Peace.' And their call shall end with, `Praise is to Allah, the Lord of the worlds","10:11":"And if Allah should hasten bad things to happen to men as they desire the good things to hasten to them, their doom should certainly have been decreed for them. But We leave them to wander blindly in their inordinateness — those who expect not to meet Us","10:12":"And when any bad thing afflicts man, he calls Us, lying on his side, sitting or standing. But when We remove his affliction from him, he goes on as if he had never called to Us regarding the bad thing that afflicted him. Their deeds are thus made to look good to the transgressors","10:13":"And certainly We did destroy generations before you when they became unjust. And their Messengers had come to them with clear signs, but they would not believe. We did thus give the sinning people their dues","10:14":"Then We made you their successors on the earth to see how you act","10:15":"And when Our clear Verses are recited to them, those who expect not to meet Us, say, \"Bring a Qur'aan other than this, or change it.\" Say, \"I cannot change it on my own initiative. I follow naught but what is revealed to me. I do indeed fear the punishment of a great Day, if I disobey my Lord","10:16":"Say, \"If Allah had so willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would you have known anything about it. I did live a lifetime among you before it. Don't you then understand","10:17":"Who is then more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or denies His Verses/signs? Never shall the sinners succeed","10:18":"And they worship, besides Allah, what can neither harm them nor benefit them, and they say, \"These are our intercessors with Allah.\" Say, \"Do you inform Allah of what He knows not in the heavens and the earth!?\" Glorified and supremely exalted is He above what they worship besides Him","10:19":"And mankind is naught but a single community, and yet they differ. Had it not been for a word already gone forth from your Lord, the issues, on which they differ, would have certainly been decided among them","10:20":"And they say, \"Why is no sign sent to him from his Lord?\" Say, \"The knowledge of the unseen is only with Allah. Well, wait! I am indeed with you among those who wait.\"h","10:21":"And when We make people taste mercy after a bad thing afflicts them, then it is that they plan to subvert Our Verses/signs.

Spring forth therewith all kinds of vegetation on the earth, of which men and cattle eat. Until, when the earth puts on its golden raiment and it becomes adorned, and its people think that they have mastery over it, Our command comes to it, by night or by day, and We make it barren, as though it had not flourished anytime in the recent past. Thus do We explain the Verses/signs for a people who reflect","10:25":"And Allah invites to the abode of peace and guides, whom He pleases, to the Straight Path","10:26":"There is good — and more besides — for those who do good. And no gloom and no ignominy shall cover their faces. Those shall be the inmates of the Garden. Therein they shall abide","10:27":"And as for those who have earned evil, the punishment for an evil is the like thereof, and ignominy shall cover them — they shall have none to protect them from Allah — as if their faces were covered with slices of the dense darkness of night. Those shall be the inmates of the Fire. Therein they shall abide","10:28":"And on the day We gather them all together, We will say to those who worshipped others besides Allah, \"Be there where you are — you and your gods other than Allah!\" We shall then separate them, one from another. And their gods would say, \"It was not us that you worshipped","10:29":"And Allah is sufficient as a witness, between us and you, that we were quite unaware of your worship","10:30":"There, everyone will be tried for what it did before, and they shall be brought back to Allah, their true Patron. And what they concocted shall desert them","10:31":"Ask them, \"Who provides for you means of sustenance from the heavens and the earth? Or Who controls the hearing and the sights? And Who brings out the living from the dead, and the dead from the living? And Who plans the affairs prudently and executes them well?\" They will reply, \"Allah.\" Then ask, \"Won't you then fear Him","10:32":"This then is Allah, your true Lord! And what remains there after the truth but error? How could you then be turned away from this Absolute Truth","10:33":"Thus is your Lord's word, that they will not believe, proved true with regard to such as defiantly disobey Allah","10:34":"Say, \"Is there any one among those whom you worship besides Allah, who can pioneer the creation and then reproduce it?\" Say, \"Allah pioneers the creation and then He reproduces it. How then are you fooled by falsehood","10:35":"Say, \"Is there anyone, among those whom you worship besides Allah, who guides to the truth?\" Say, \"Allah it is Who guides to the truth. Is He then Who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed, or he who himself does not go aright unless he is guided? What's the matter with you? How wrongly do you make your decisions","10:36":"And most of them do not follow anything but conjecture. Conjecture will avail nothing indeed against the Truth. Allah is indeed aware of what they do","10:37":"And this Qur'aan is not such as could be forged by those besides Allah. But it is a confirmation of what came before it. And it is, no doubt, the book, explained in details, from the Lord of the worlds","10:38":"Or do they say that he (the Prophet) has forged it? Say, \"Then bring a chapter like this and invite whom you can, besides Allah, if you are truthful","10:39":"Nay, they reject all that is beyond their knowledge and comprehension, as false.

But can you make the deaf to listen even when they cannot understand","10:43":"And there are those of them who appear to be looking at you. But can you give guidance to the blind even when they cannot see","10:44":"Indeed, Allah does not wrong mankind in anything, but they wrong themselves","10:45":"And the day He will resurrect them and gather them all together, they will introduce one another as if they had halted but for a little while of daytime. Those who belied their meeting with Allah are indeed doomed, and they were not on right guidance","10:46":"And if We show you some of the things We promised to them, or if We cause you to die, yet to Us is their return, and Allah is witness to what they do","10:47":"And for every Ummaa Messenger. And when their Messenger came, they were judged equitably and they were not wronged","10:48":"And they ask, \"When will this prophecy come about, if what you say is true","10:49":"Say, \"I have no control over any harm, or any benefit, coming to me, except what Allah pleases. Every Ummah has its term. When their term comes, they shall not then remain here a moment more, nor can they go before their time","10:50":"Say, \"Have you ever considered that if His punishment overtakes you by night or by day, what then would there be for the sinners to ask for hastening of","10:51":"And will you believe in it only when it comes to pass? What then!? And you did want it hastened","10:52":"Then those who did wrong shall be told, \"Taste the everlasting punishment! Was it not but what you deserved","10:53":"And they ask you, \"Is that true?\" Say, \"Yes, by my Lord! It is indeed the truth.

Allah is indeed full of grace for mankind, but most of them are ungrateful","10:61":"And you are engaged not in anything, and you read not concerning it in any portion of the Qur'aan, and you do not do any deed, but We are witnesses over you when you get involved therein. And not an atom-weight of anything, in the earth or in the heavens, lies concealed from your Lord.

But they could not believe in what they had rejected before. Thus it is that We set seals upon the hearts of those who exceed the limits","10:75":"Then did We raise up after them Moses and Aaron and send them to Pharaoh and his nobles with Our signs. But they were too proud and they were a sinning people","10:76":"So when the truth came to them from Us they said, \"This indeed is magic manifest","10:77":"Moses said, \"Do you say this of the truth when it comes to you? Is this magic? And the magicians prevail not","10:78":"They said, \"Have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our fathers upon, and is greatness bestowed just on you two on earth?

Allah will indeed bring it to naught. Allah does indeed not promote the work of those who spread discord","10:82":"And Allah will show the truth to be the truth by His commands, even though the criminals may not like it","10:83":"So then none believed in Moses — except for the progeny of his own people — out of fear of Pharaoh and their nobles, lest he should persecute them. And indeed did Pharaoh have some power on the earth and indeed he was of those who committed excesses","10:84":"And Moses said, \"O my people! If you do believe in Allah and if you are of those who do submit to Him, then do trust Him","10:85":"So they said, \"On Allah do we trust. O our Lord! Subject us not to the persecution of the unjust people","10:86":"And do deliver us, by Your mercy, from the people who suppress the Truth","10:87":"And We told Moses and his brother, \"Prepare some houses in Egypt as spiritual centres for your people and establish prayer.

And, indeed, most people are oblivious to Our signs.\" @ @ This revelation about the saving of the Pharaoh's body was made in the seventh century A.D. Although the Bible recounts the exodus and the drowning of the Pharaoh, it makes no mention of his body having been saved — nor does the Torah do it. And there is no evidence at all that anyone knew about it when the Qur'aan made this revelation. And except for the believers, no one knew about it as a fact till the nineteenth century when the body was discovered [Watch the YouTube Video]. This is one of the many signs giving clear indication of the Qur'aan being divine.

Everything is in a manifest Record","11:7":"And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods of time — and His Throne was on ether — that He might test you as to which of you are better in deeds. And if you say, `You shall indeed be raised up after death', those who suppress the Truth would certainly counter, `This is nothing but sheer delusion","11:8":"And if We put off the punishment from them for a certain period of time, they will certainly say, \"What holds it back?\" Verily on the day when it will come to them, nothing can turn it away from them. And that which they scoffed at shall besiege them","11:9":"And, certainly, if We make man taste mercy from Us and then take it off from him, he is indeed sure to despair and be ungrateful","11:10":"And if We make him taste a favour after distress has afflicted him, he will certainly say, \"Bad days have gone away from me.\" He certainly indeed exults, boasts","11:11":"But not those who are patient and do good deeds. For them shall there be forgiveness and a great reward","11:12":"Then, in order that you abandon part of what is revealed to you and your mind becomes dustressed by it that they say, \"Why has not a treasure been sent down upon him or an angel come with him?\" You are only a warner; and Allah is the One to take care of all things","11:13":"Or, they say, \"He has forged it.\" Say, \"Then bring ten chapters similarly forged and call for aid from whom you can besides Allah, if what you say is the truth","11:14":"If they do not respond to you, then know that it (the Qur'aan) is revealed with Allah's knowledge and that there is no god but He. Will you then be the ones who submit","11:15":"Whoever desires the life of this world and its charm, We will repay them in full their deeds therein, and therein they shall not be wronged","11:16":"These are they for whom there is nothing but the Fire in the Hereafter. And what they do here, in this world, shall be of no use there. And what they do here is false and futile","11:17":"What then about the one who stands on clear evidence from his Lord and a witness from Him recites it — and before it, was there the Book of Moses, a precedent and mercy? Such are the ones that believe in it. And whoever, of the tribes, that suppresses the truth in it, the promise to him shall be the Fire. Be not then in doubt about it. It is indeed the Truth from your Lord, but most people believe not","11:18":"And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah? These shall be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses shall say, \"These are they who lied against their Lord.\" Verily Allah's curse is on the unjust —","11:19":"On those that turn people away from Allah's Path and seek to distort it — and those are the ones that believe not in the Hereafter","11:20":"They are in no position to frustrate Allah's Will on the earth, nor can they have any awliya besides Allah. The punishment shall be doubled for them. They could not hear nor see the Truth","11:21":"Those are the ones that have doomed themselves. And what they concocted has deserted them","11:22":"No doubt, they are the ones that shall in the Hereafter be doomed","11:23":"Indeed, as for those who believe and do good deeds and are humble towards their Lord, they are the dwellers of the Garden. They shall reside therein forever","11:24":"Are the examples of two persons — one blind and deaf, and the other who sees and hears — the same? Don't you then reflect","11:25":"And We did send Noah to his people. He told them, \"I have indeed come to give you a plain warning","11:26":"That you shall not worship anyone but Allah. I do indeed fear for you the punishment of a painful day","11:27":"And the chiefs of those who suppressed the Truth from among his people said, \"We do not consider you but a man like us, and we do not see any have followed you but those meanest amongst us who have just followed you without conviction. And we do not see in you any excellence over us; nay, we deem you liars","11:28":"He said, \"O my people! Do you see that if I have been on clear evidence from my Lord and He has bestowed upon me mercy from Himself, and it is obscure to you, can we force it on you while you are averse to it","11:29":"And, O my people! I ask you not for any material compensation for it; my reward is upon none but Allah. And I am not going to drive away those who believe. They shall certainly meet their Lord. And, on the other hand, I see you as an ignorant people","11:30":"And, O my people! Who is there to help me against Allah if I drive them away? Won't you reflect on this","11:31":"And I do not say to you that I have the treasures of Allah. And I do not know the unseen, and I do not say I am an angel, nor do I say that Allah will never grant any good things to those who are mean in your eyes. Allah knows well what is there in them. I would indeed be of the unjust, otherwise","11:32":"They said, \"O Noah! You did argue with us a great deal. Now bring us what you threaten us with, if what you say is the truth","11:33":"He said, \"Only Allah will bring it to you if He wills, and you won't be able to do anything to prevent it","11:34":"And if I intend to give you advice, my advice will not profit you if Allah intended that He should leave you go astray. He is your Lord, and to Him shall you be returned","11:35":"They do say, \"He has concocted it.\" Say, \"If I have concocted it, then it is my sin and I shall be punished for it. But the responsibility for the sin you commit shall not be on me.\"h","11:36":"And it was revealed to Noah, \"None of your people will believe except those who have already believed. So grieve not at what they do","11:37":"And construct the ark under Our supervision and guidance, and do not address Me for those who are unjust. They shall indeed be drowned","11:38":"And he began constructing the ark. And whenever the chiefs from among his people passed by him, they laughed at him. He said, \"If you laugh at us, we too indeed laugh at you as you laugh at us","11:39":"So you shall soon come to know on whom will a punishment come that will disgrace him, and on whom will the lasting punishment be imposed","11:40":"Until when Our command came to be executed and the oven boiled over, We said, \"Carryh in it two of every pair, your own family — except those against whom the divine decree has already come — and those who believe.\" And only a few had believed with him","11:41":"And he said, \"Get on board! In the name of Allah are its sailing and its anchoring. My Lord is indeed Forgiving, Merciful","11:42":"And it moved on with them amid waves like mountains, and Noah called out to his son, and he was isolated from others, \"O my son! Get on board with us and be not with those who suppress the Truth","11:43":"He said, \"I will take shelter on a mountain that shall protect me from the water.\" Noah said, \"There is no protection today from Allah's command but for him on whom He shows mercy.\" And a wave intervened between them, and he (the son) was drowned","11:44":"And it was decreed, \"O earth, swallow down your water, and O sky, stop!\" And the water was made to abate and the divine Will, accomplished. And the Ark came to rest on the Judi, and it was proclaimed, \"Away with the unjust people","11:45":"And Noah called upon his Lord and said, \"My Lord! My son indeed is a member of my family, and Your promise is indeed true, and You are the best Judge","11:46":"He said, \"O Noah! He is indeed not of your family. His deeds indeed are not good. Put Me no questions then about things of which you are given no knowledge. I do indeed admonish you lest you be of those who do things ignorantly","11:47":"He said, \"My Lord! I seek refuge in You lest I again put questions to You about things of which I am given no knowledge. And should You forgive me not and have no mercy on me, I should then be of those who are doomed","11:48":"It was said, \"O Noah! Disembark, with peace from Us and blessings on you and on those of the communities, who are with you. And there will be communities whom We shall provide for, and then a painful punishment from Us shall afflict them","11:49":"These are narratives relating to the unseen which We reveal to you. You did not know them — neither you nor your people — before this. Do have patience then! The end shall indeed be in favour of those who fear Allah","11:50":"And to the people of AAad We sent their brother Hood. He said, \"O my people! Worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. You do not but fabricate lies","11:51":"O my people! I do not ask of you any reward for it. My reward is only with Him Who created me. Don't you understand","11:52":"And, O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord and then turn to Him in repentance. He will send down on you abundant rain and add strength to your strength. And do not turn back to sin","11:53":"They said, \"O Hood! You have not brought to us any clear sign and we are not going to desert our gods on your word, and we do not believe in you","11:54":"We do not but say that some of our gods have worked evil on you.\" He said, \"I do indeed call Allah to witness — and you do bear witness — that I am absolutely free of the sin you commit of worshipping anyone","11:55":"other than Him. All of you do together scheme against me then, and give me no respite","11:56":"I do indeed have trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is no living creature but He holds it by its forelock. My Lord is indeed on the Straight Path","11:57":"And if you turn away, then indeed I have delivered to you what I have been sent to you with. And my Lord will bring another people in your place, and you can do Him no harm. My Lord is indeed the Guardian over all things","11:58":"And when Our decree came to pass, We saved Hood, and those who believed with him, as a mercy from Us. And We saved them from a hard punishment","11:59":"And these were the people of AAad! They disputed the Verses/signs of their Lord, disobeyed His Messengers and followed the bidding of anyone obstinately strong and powerful","11:60":"And they were pursued by curse in this world and so will they be, on the Resurrection Day. Verily, AAad suppressed the Truth about their Lord! Verily, indeed, AAad, the people of Hood perished","11:61":"And to the people of ThamoodWe sent their brother Salih. He said, \"O my people! Worship Allah, you have no god other than He. He brought you into being from the earth, and made you dwell on it. Ask forgiveness of Him then, and turn to Him in repentance. My Lord is indeed close and He does respond","11:62":"They said, \"O Salih! Before this, we did have great expectations in you. Do you now forbid us from worshipping what our fathers worshipped? And we are indeed in great doubt in that which you call us to","11:63":"He said, \"O my people! Do you see that if I have been on clear evidence from my Lord and He has bestowed upon me mercy from Himself, who will then help me against Allah if I disobey Him? You would then cause no increase in anything for me, other than in loss","11:64":"And, O my people, this is Allah's she-camel for you — a sign. So leave her free to pasture on Allah's earth. And do her no harm, for then, soon, a punishment will seize you","11:65":"But they crippled her. Then he said, \"Enjoy in your abode just for three days. That is a promise that shall not prove to be false","11:66":"So when Our decree came to pass, We saved Salih, and those who believed with him, by mercy from Us and from the disgrace of that day. Your Lord indeed is the One Strong and Omnipotent","11:67":"And the terribly rumbling sound struck those who were unjust, and they lay prostrate in their houses","11:68":"As though they had never flourished in them. Verily, Thamood suppressed the Truth about their Lord! Verily, Thamood perished","11:69":"And certainly Our messengers came to Abraham with good news. They said, \"Peace.\" \"Peace.\" said he, and he made no delay in bringing a roasted calf","11:70":"But when he saw that their hands were not extended towards it, he had misgivings about them and became fearful of them. They said, \"Fear not, we are sent but for people of Lot","11:71":"And his wife, standing by, laughed. Then We gave her the good news of Isaac, and of Jacob after Isaac","11:72":"She said, \"Alas! Shall I bear a son when I am an old woman and this my husband an old man? This is indeed a strange thing","11:73":"They said, \"Do you consider it strange that Allah does what He wills? Allah's mercy and His blessings are on you, O members of this household! He is indeed Praiseworthy, Glorious","11:74":"And when the fear was gone from Abraham and the good news came to him, he began pleading with Us for the people of Lot","11:75":"Abraham was indeed considerate and tender-hearted, often turning to Allah in repentance","11:76":"O Abraham! Forget it. The decree of your Lord on this has indeed come to pass. And a punishment, that cannot be undone, is indeed coming to them","11:77":"And when Our Messengers came to Lot, he was worried about them, and he felt powerless to protect them. And he said, \"This is a dreadful day","11:78":"And his people came rushing towards him, and they had indulged in evil deeds before. He said, \"O my people! These, my daughters, are purer for you. So fear Allah and do not disgrace me with regard to my guests. Is there no rightly-guided man amongst you","11:79":"They said, \"You do certainly know that we have nothing to do with your daughters. And you do indeed know what we want","11:80":"He said, \"I wish I had power to resist you, or had recourse to a strong support","11:81":"They said, \"O Lot! We are the Messengers of your Lord. They won't reach you. So leave this place, with your family, sometime in the night. And let none of you tarry, except for your wife. What happens to them shall indeed happen to her. The appointed time for them is the morning indeed. Is not the morning nigh","11:82":"And when Our decree came to pass, We turned them upside down and rained down upon them layer over layer of stones of dry and hardened mud","11:83":"These stand targeted with your Lord and never far from the unjust","11:84":"And to the people of Midian, We sent their brother Shu'aib. He said, \"O my people! Worship Allah. You have no god other than Him. And cheat not in measure and weight. I do indeed see you that you are in prosperity, and I do indeed fear for you the punishment of a Day that will not leave out anything","11:85":"And, O my people! Give full and fair measure and weight, and defraud not people of their things. And make no mischief on earth, spreading corruption","11:86":"What lawful gain Allah keeps back for you is better, if you but believe! And I am not a guardian over you","11:87":"They said, \"O Shu'aib! Does the code of your worship enjoin you that we should forsake what our fathers worshipped, or that we should not do what we please with our property? You have indeed been the considerate and right-thinking person","11:88":"He said, \"O my people! Do you see that, if I have been on clear evidence from my Lord and He has given me a good providence from Him Himself, and I do not wish to do, behind your backs, the very thing that I forbid you from, I desire nothing but reform so far as I am able to? And I get inspiration from none but Allah. On Him do I place my trust and to Him do I turn","11:89":"And, O my people, let not hostility to me make you commit sin so that there may befall on you the like of what befell the peoples of Noah, Hood or Salih. And the people of Lot were not very far in the past from you","11:90":"And ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance. My Lord is indeed Merciful, Loving","11:91":"They said, \"O Shu'aib! We do not understand much of what you say and we do indeed consider you weak amongst us. And were it not for your family we would surely have stoned you to death. And you have no power over us","11:92":"He said, \"O my people! Is my family more powerful for you than Allah? And you put Him behind your backs? What you do is indeed under the ever vigilant purview of my Lord.\"h","11:93":"And, O my people! Do what you can. I do what I do. You will soon come to know upon whom the disgracing punishment shall come and who the liar is. And you do wait! Indeed! I too am waiting with you","11:94":"And when did Our decree come to pass, We saved, by mercy from Us, Shu'aib and those who believed with him. And the terribly rumbling sound struck those who were unjust, and they lay prostrate in their homes","11:95":"As though they had never dwelt in them! Verily, the people of Midian perished just as the people of Thamood had perished","11:96":"And certainly We did send Moses with Our signs/Verses and clear authority","11:97":"To Pharoah and his chieftains who followed his rule. And Pharaoh's rule was not good","11:98":"He (Pharaoh) shall lead his people, on the Resurrection Day, to the Fire. And bad is the place which they shall be led to","11:99":"And curse followed them in this world and shall follow them on the Resurrection Day. Bad would be the gift they shall be given","11:100":"This is an account, We relate to you, of the peoples that inhabited this earth. Of them are some that still exist and others, destroyed","11:101":"And We wronged them not, but they wronged themselves. And their gods, whom they invoked besides Allah, did avail them nothing when the decree of your Lord came to pass. And they but added to their ruin","11:102":"And such was the seizure of your Lord when He seized the inhabitants of the earth while they did wrong. His seizure is indeed painful, severe","11:103":"There is indeed in this a sign for him who fears the punishment in the Hereafter. This is the day for the gathering together of mankind and this is the day for production of evidence","11:104":"And We won't convene the Hereafter till an appointed time","11:105":"The day when it is convened, no one shall speak except with His permission. Some of them then shall be miserable, and some happy","11:106":"The miserable ones, then, shall be in the Fire. For them there shall be sighing and groaning in it","11:107":"They shall abide therein so long as the heavens and the earth last, unless your Lord wills otherwise. Your Lord does indeed do what He wills","11:108":"And the happy ones, then, shall be in the Paradise. They shall abide therein as long as the heavens and the earth last, unless your Lord wills otherwise. It's a gift that shall never be terminated","11:109":"Be not then in doubt as to what these people worship: they do not worship but as their fathers did before. And indeed We will pay them back in full their due, undiminished","11:110":"And certainly did We give the Book to Moses, and disputes were raised therein. And had not a Word already gone forth from your Lord, the matter would surely have been decided between them. And the sceptics are indeed in doubt over it","11:111":"And your Lord will indeed pay back to them all for their deeds in full. He is indeed aware of what they do","11:112":"Stand firm then, you and those who have turned to Allah with you, on what you are commanded with, and transgress not. HE does indeed see what you do","11:113":"And do not incline towards those who are unjust, lest the Fire catches you. And you have no awliya other than Allah, and you shall not be helped","11:114":"And establish prayer at the two ends of the day and proximities of the night. Good deedsh do indeed eradicate the evil. This is a reminder to those who remember Allah much","11:115":"And be patient; for, Allah does indeed not let the good people do, go unrewarded","11:116":"If only there were, among the generations before you, more men of understanding forbidding mischief on earth! There were but a few men of understanding of those whom We saved from among them. And those who were unjust were preoccupied with the luxuries they were given. And they sinned","11:117":"And your Lord could not have unjustly destroyed habitations, while the people living there were good","11:118":"And if your Lord had so willed, He would certainly have made mankind a single community. And they shall not cease to differ","11:119":"Except for those to whom your Lord turns with mercy. And for this did He create them.h And the statement of your Lord is bound to be fulfilled, \"I will certainly fill Hell with the jinn and the human beings, together","11:120":"All that we relate to you of the accounts of the Messengers is to strengthen your mind therewith. And in this have come to you the Truth, Admonition and a Book, for being frequently referred to, for the believers","11:121":"And tell those who do not believe \"You act your way; we act ours","11:122":"And you wait. We too indeed wait","11:123":"And Allah's are the secrets of the heavens and the earth and to Him are all matters returned. Do worship Him then and do put thy trust in Him! And thy Lord is not unaware of what you do","12:1":"Alif Lam Ra. These are the Verses of the open, clear and self-explanatory Book","12:2":"We have indeed sent it down as an Arabic Quran in order that you understand it","12:3":"We narrate to you the best of narratives by Our revealing to you this Quran. And, before this, you were indeed among those who did not know","12:4":"When Joseph said to his father, \"O my father! I did indeed see eleven stars and the sun and the moon. I saw them prostrating to me","12:5":"He said, \"O my son! Do not relate your dream to your brothers, lest they devise a plan against you. The Satan is indeed an open enemy to man","12:6":"And accordingly [according to interpretation of the dream, that is,] your Lord will choose you and teach you the interpretation of events and complete His favour upon you and upon the children of Jacob, as He did complete it, before, upon your fathers, Abraham and Isaac. Your Lord is indeed Knowledgeable, Wise","12:7":"Certainly in Joseph and his brothers there are signs for the seekers","12:8":"When they said, \"Certainly Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we. And we are more in number and strength. Our father is indeed making a manifest mistake","12:9":"Kill Joseph or abandon him into a distant land, so that your father dotes on you exclusively. And thereafter you can become righteous people","12:10":"One of them said, \"Do not kill Joseph, but, if you must do something about him, put him down into the bottom of a well so that some travellers may pick him up","12:11":"They said, \"O our father! Why do you not trust us with regard to Joseph? And we are indeed his sincere well-wishers","12:12":"Send him with us tomorrow that he may eat, drink and play. And we will indeed guard him well","12:13":"Their father said, \"It does indeed grieve me that you should take him away. And I fear lest the wolf devour him while your attention is diverted from him","12:14":"They said, \"Surely if the wolf should devour him even when we are a strong group, we should then indeed be the doomed ones","12:15":"So then they went off with him and mutually agreed that they should put him down at the bottom of a well. And We revealed to him, \"They know it not, but you shall one day certainly tell them of this act of theirs","12:16":"And they came to their father in the evening, weeping","12:17":"They said, \"O our father! We did indeed get ourselves engaged in the racing game and left Joseph behind with our goods. Then, the wolf ate him. And you will not believe us though we do tell you the truth","12:18":"And they brought his shirt with fake blood thereon. He said, \"Nay, you yourselves have contrived this tale. All I can do is resort to graceful patience. And it is Allah's help that is sought, against what you tell me","12:19":"And a caravan of travellers did come there and they sent their man to draw water from the well and he let down his bucket. He exclaimed, \"O goodness! There is a boy there.\" And they took him along as an article of merchandise. And Allah knew what they did","12:20":"And they sold him for a paltry price — a few dirhams — and they had been eager to get rid of him","12:21":"And the man from the city who bought him said to his wife, \"Make his stay comfortable. Maybe he will be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son.\" And thus did We establish Joseph in the land and taught him the interpretation of events. And Allah is in complete control of what He does, but most people know not","12:22":"And when he attained his maturity, We gave him authority and knowledge. And thus do We reward those who are good","12:23":"And she, in whose house he lived, solicited him, closed the doors and said, \"Come on!\" He said, \"I seek Allah's protection. My master has indeed given me good shelter. Those who do wrong shall indeed not prosper","12:24":"And she did desire him. And he would have desired her too, had he not seen a clear sign from his Lord. Thus did We turn evil and indecency away from him. He was indeed one of Our sincere worshippers","12:25":"And they both hastened to the door, and she tore off his shirt from behind and they met her husband at the door. She said, \"What is to be done to him who wanted to molest your wife except to imprison him or give him some other painful punishment","12:26":"He [Joseph] said, \"It was she who tried to seduce me.\" And a witness from her own family said, \"If his shirt is torn off from the front, she speaks the truth and he is the liar","12:27":"And if his shirt is torn off from behind, she is telling a lie and he is telling the truth","12:28":"So when he (husband of the woman) saw his (Joseph's) shirt torn off from behind, he (the husband) said, \"It is indeed an instance of female cunningness. You women are indeed great at being cunning","12:29":"Joseph! You stay away from this; and (to his wife) You ask forgiveness for your sin, You are indeed the one at fault","12:30":"And the city women gossiped, \"The nobleman's wife has tried to seduce her young slave. She is surely overcome with love for him. We do indeed see her going manifestly astray","12:31":"So when she heard of their malicious talk, she sent for them and arranged comfortable seats for them. And she gave everyone of them a knife, and asked Joseph to come out before them. So when they saw him, they were so much stunned by his personality that they cut their hands, and said, \"Glory to Allah! This is not a man; this is none but a noble angel","12:32":"She said, \"This is the man whom you blamed me about. And I did certainly seek to seduce him, but he resisted. And if he does not do my bidding, he shall certainly be imprisoned, and he shall certainly suffer the ignominy","12:33":"He said, \"My Lord! I would prefer to go to jail rather than do what they invite me to. And unless You make their scheme against me ineffective, I will be tempted towards them and behave as one ignorant","12:34":"His Lord then accepted his prayer and made their scheme against him ineffective. He (Allah) does indeed hear, know","12:35":"Then, after weighing the pros and cons of the matter, they thought it advisable to keep him in the prison for the time being","12:36":"And two youngsters entered the prison with him. One of them said, \"I saw myself making wine.\" And the other said, \"I saw myself carrying bread on my head, birds eating wherefrom. Tell us what it means. We do indeed see you as a good man","12:37":"He said, \"I shall tell you both what the dreams mean before the food you eat is brought to you. This is one of the things my Lord has taught me. I have indeed forsaken the lifestyle of people who do not believe in Allah, and who deny the Hereafter","12:38":"And I follow the lifestyle of my forefathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. We do not have to worship anything other than Allah. This is by Allah's grace upon us and on mankind, but most people are ungrateful","12:39":"O my two prison mates! Are sundry lords better or Allah the One, the Almighty","12:40":"What you worship besides Him are but fictitious things to which you and your fathers have given names. Allah has not sent down any authority for them. The absolute authority is with Allah alone. He has commanded that you shall not worship anything or anybody but Him. This is the established way of life, but most people know not","12:41":"O my two prison mates! As for the first one of you, he shall serve wine to his lord. And as for the other, he shall be crucified, and the birds shall peck from his head. The matter you inquired about is so decreed","12:42":"And he (Joseph) said to the one of the two, whom he thought was definitely going to be saved, \"Mention me to your lord.\" But the Satan caused him to forget mentioning him to his lord, so he remained in the prison for a few years","12:43":"And the king said, \"I saw seven fat cows, but seven lean cows ate them up! And I saw seven ears of corn that were green and other ears that were withered and dry. O chieftains! Explain to me my dream, if you do know how to interpret dreams","12:44":"They said, \"Dreams are jumbled, and we do not know the interpretation of dreams","12:45":"And of the two prisoners, the one, who survived, recollected after a long time Joseph's request to him and said, \"I will give you its interpretation, and let me go out now to get it","12:46":"Joseph! O truthful one! Explain to us the dream in which there were seven fat cows, but seven lean cows ate them up! Besides, there were seven ears of corn that were green and other ears that were withered and dry. Explain, so that I may go back to those people and let them know","12:47":"Joseph explained, \"You shall sow for seven years continuously, then leave what you reap in ears, except the little that you need for immediate consumption","12:48":"Then there shall come thereafter seven years of hardship which shall eat away all that you would have preserved for those years, except for a little thereof","12:49":"Then there will come after that a year in which people shall have rain and in which they shall produce wine/oil","12:50":"And the king said, \"Bring him (Joseph) to me.\" So when the messenger came to him, he said, \"Go back to your lord and ask him about the case of the women who cut their hands. My Lord does indeed know their guile","12:51":"The king called for the women and asked them, \"What have you to say on the affair when you sought to seduce Joseph?\" They said, \"Glory to Allah! We knew of no evil on his part.\" And the chieftain's wife said, \"Now that the truth has come out, it was I who tried to seduce him, and he is indeed the truthful one","12:52":"This is to let him (Joseph) know that I have not betrayed him behind his back and that Allah guides not the scheme of the betrayers","12:53":"The Chieftain's wife continued, \"And I do not claim to be innocent. The self is indeed prone to evil, except for such as my Lord has had mercy on. Indeed! My Lord is Forgiving, Merciful","12:54":"And the king said, \"Bring him to me. I will make him my personal aide.\" So when Joseph was brought to him, the king said, \"You are indeed from today a trusted person in an honourable position with us","12:55":"Joseph said, \"Place me in authority over the treasures of the land. I know how to keep them well preserved","12:56":"And thus did We give Yusuf an honourable position in the land. He could settle therein in whatever way he liked. We bestow Our mercy upon whom We please. And We do not let good people go unrewarded","12:57":"And certainly the reward of the Hereafter is much better for those who believe and fear Allah","12:58":"And Joseph's brothers came and went in to him, when he recognised them and they did not recognise him","12:59":"And when he furnished them their provision, Joseph said, \"Bring to me the other brother you have from your father! Do you not see that I give you your full ration and offer you hospitality at its best","12:60":"But if you do not bring him to me, you shall have no ration from me, nor shall you come near me","12:61":"They said, \"We will plead for him with his father, and we will most certainly do that","12:62":"And Joseph told his men, \"Put back their payments secretly in their bags so that they come to know about it only when they go back to their family. It may induce them to come back here","12:63":"So when they returned to their father, they said, \"O our father, our ration would be denied to us. Therefore send our brother with us. We may then get our ration, and we will most certainly take care of him","12:64":"He said, \"Shall I entrust him to you just as I entrusted to you his brother before? But Allah is the best Protector, and He is the most Merciful","12:65":"And when they opened their goods, they found returned to them what they had paid therefor! They said, \"O our father, what more can we desire? Here is our capital returned to us! Now we can feed our family, take care of our brother, and have a surplus of a camel load of grains. This would make our problem of getting sufficient ration easy","12:66":"He said, \"I will not send him with you until you give me a pledge, in Allah's name, that you will most certainly bring him back to me unless in the circumstance that you are besieged. And when they gave him their pledge, he said, \"Allah is Witness and Trustee to what we say","12:67":"And he said, \"O my sons! Do not enter by one gate and enter by different gates. And I can avail you nothing against Allah. The absolute authority is with none but Allah. On Him I do trust. And on Him then let those who trust, put their trust","12:68":"And when they entered as their father had bidden them, it availed them nothing against Allah. It was an act deemed prudent by Jacob and he expressed it. And indeed he had the knowledge We taught him, but most people know not","12:69":"And when they went in to Joseph, he took his brotherhto stay with himself, and told him, \"I am your brother, therefore grieve not at what they do","12:70":"So when he gave them their provisions, he placed a cup in his brother's bag. Then someone cried out, \"O people of the caravan! You are most surely thieves","12:71":"Joseph's brothers in the caravan came forward and asked, \"What is it that you find missing","12:72":"Joseph's men replied, \"We find the king's cup missing, and he, who comes up with it, shall get a camel-load of extra grains.\" And Joseph added, \"I am guarantor of this","12:73":"Joseph's brothers said, \"By Allah! You know for certain that we have not come to make mischief in the land, and we are not thieves","12:74":"The men asked, \"But what should be the punishment for this, if you happen to be lying","12:75":"The brothers said, \"The punishment for this is that the person in whose bag it is found shall himself suffer it. Thus we do punish the wrongdoers","12:76":"So he (Joseph) began the search with their (his step-brothers') packs before searching the pack of his brother, and then he brought it (the king's cup) out from his brother's pack. Thus did We plan a stratagem for the sake of Joseph. He could not legally take and keep his brother with him under the king's laws, unless Allah pleased.We raise the ranks of whomsoever We please. And over every person of knowledge, there is one having better knowledge","12:77":"They said, \"If he has stolen, a brother of his did indeed steal before.\" And Joseph kept his secret with himself and did not disclose it to them. He said, \"You have been in a wicked state of mind and Allah knows the truth about the clarification you have given","12:78":"They said, \"Sir! He has a very old father; so, retain one of us in his place. We do indeed see you as a good man","12:79":"He said, \"Allah forbid that we seize a man other than him with whom we found our property. We would indeed then be doing a very wrong thing","12:80":"Then when they got despaired of him, they conferred among themselves. The eldest of them said, \"Do you not know that your father took from you a pledge in Allah's name, and that you committed excesses in respect of Joseph, before? Therefore I will not leave this place until my father permits me or Allah otherwise decrees for me. And He is the best Ruler","12:81":"Go back to your father.\" They went back and said, \"O our father! Your son did indeed commit theft, and we do not bear witness except to what we have known. And we could not keep watch over the unseen","12:82":"And make enquiries at the place in which we had been to and with the caravan with which we had proceeded. And what we say is most certainly true","12:83":"He (Jacob) said, \"Nay, you have made up a convenient story for yourselves! So it is better for me to be patient. Maybe, Allah will bring them all together to me. He is indeed Knowledgeable, Wise","12:84":"And, turning away from them, he silently cried, \"Alas for Joseph!\" And his eyes turned white with grief, and he did control his emotions","12:85":"They (Joseph's brothers) said to him, \"By Allah! You will cease not remembering Joseph until you get severely ill or get perished","12:86":"He said, \"I complain of my distress and grief only to Allah. And I know from Allah what you do not know","12:87":"O my sons! Go and make enquiries about Joseph and his brother, and despair not of getting relief from Allah. Indeed, none but the people who suppress the Truth despair of getting relief from Allah","12:88":"So when the brothers came back to Joseph, they said, \"Sir! Distress has afflicted us and our family and we have brought but little capital to pay for the rations. Give us the full ration and be charitable to us. Allah does indeed reward those that are charitable","12:89":"He said, \"Do you know how you treated Joseph and his brother in your ignorance","12:90":"They said, \"Are you indeed Joseph?\" He said, \"I am Joseph and this is my brother. Allah has certainly been gracious to us. Indeed, such is the reward for him who fears Allah and exercises patience. And, indeed, Allah does not let the reward, of those who do good, go waste","12:91":"They said, \"By Allah! HE has certainly chosen you over us, and we were indeed the sinners","12:92":"He said, \"No reproof against you this day. Allah may forgive you, and He is the most Merciful","12:93":"Take this shirt of mine and put it on my father's face. He will be able to see. And then come back to me with your entire family","12:94":"And when the caravan had set out, their father said, \"I do indeed get the smell of Joseph, unless you consider me delirious","12:95":"Those who were there with him said, \"By Allah, you are indeed in your old error","12:96":"And when the bearer of good news (Joseph's brother with Joseph's shirt) did arrive, he put the shirt on the face of Jacob, who then got back his sight. Jacob said, \"Did I not tell you that I know from Allah what you know not","12:97":"They said, \"O our father! Pray for forgiveness of our sins. We indeed did wrong","12:98":"The father said, \"I will pray to my Lord to forgive you. He is indeed Forgiving, Merciful","12:99":"When they then came to Joseph, he got his parents to stay with him and said, \"Welcome to Egypt. You will, Allah willing, be safe here","12:100":"And Joseph raised his parents upon the throne; and they fell down in prostration before him. And he said, \"O my father! This is the interpretation of the dream I had seen before. My Lord has indeed made it come true. And He was indeed kind to me when He brought me out from the prison and brought you from the desert after the Satan had fomented discord between me and my brothers. My Lord is indeed benevolent to whom He pleases. He is indeed Knowledgeable, Wise","12:101":"My Lord! You have given me some political power and taught me some knowledge on interpretation of events. Originator of the heavens and the earth! You are my waliin this world and the Hereafter. Make me die as one who willingly submits to You and make me join the ranks of the righteous people","12:102":"This is from annals of the unseen past which We reveal to you. And you were not with them when they got together to act, and they conspired","12:103":"And most men will not believe, though you desire eagerly that they believe","12:104":"And you ask them not for any reward for this. It is nothing but that which all human beings need to constantly refer to for rightful decisions and actions in their respective worlds","12:105":"And how many a sign, in the heavens and the earth, do they pass by? And yet they turn aside from it","12:106":"And most of them do not believe in Allah without worshipping others besides Him","12:107":"Do they then feel secure that some punishment from Allah will not envelope them or that the Hour may not come to them suddenly and unknowingly","12:108":"Say, \"This is my path: I call to Allah. I and my followers are on right guidance. And glory is to Allah! I am not one of those who worship others besides Allah","12:109":"And We did not send before you any but men, from among the same communities, to whom We sent revelations. Have they not then travelled on land and seen for themselves what end those before them met with? And the abode of the Hereafter is certainly better for those who fear Allah. Do you not understand this","12:110":"The Messengers continued propagating the divine Message to the people until the Messengers despaired and reckoned that the people would not believe them. Then did Our help come to them and every person, whom We pleased, was saved. And Our punishment was not dispensed with for the sinners","12:111":"In their annals there is certainly a lesson for those endowed with insight. This is not a fabricated hadeeth, but a confirmation of what has preceded it and a detailed explanation of all things and a guide and a mercy to people who believe","13:1":"Alif Lam Meem Ra. These are Verses of the Book. And that which is revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, but most people believe not","13:2":"Allah is the One Who raised the heavens without any visible support. He then established Himself on the Throne. And He made the sun and the moon subservient. Each pursues its course till an appointed time. He is the Commander and the Governor. He explains the Verses/signs in details so that you may be certain of meeting your Lord","13:3":"And He is the One Who has stretched the earth to make mountains and rivers therein. And of every kind of fruit He made a pair mate therein. He draws the night as a veil over the day. Indeed there are signs in this for people who reflect","13:4":"And on the earth there are tracts side by side with gardens of grapes and corn and palm trees — having one common root and others having distinct roots — all irrigated with same water. And yet We make some of them excel others in flavour. There are signs indeed in this for people who understand","13:5":"And if you would consider anything as strange, then strange it is that they say, \"When we turn to dust, shall we even then be there in a new creation?\" These are they, who suppress the Truth in regard to their Lord. And they shall have chains round their necks, and they shall be the inmates of the Fire. In it they shall ever be","13:6":"And they ask you to hasten what is not good rather than what is good, and there certainly have been examples of those before them. And indeed your Lord is full of forgiveness for people, notwithstanding their wrongdoings. And indeed your Lord is severe in punishment","13:7":"And those who suppress the Truth say, \"Why has not a sign been sent down upon him from his Lord?\" You are only a warner and, for every people, a guide.h","13:8":"Allah knows what any female conceives, and what makes the wombs shrink and what makes them swell. And everything with Him is measured","13:9":"Allah has the knowledge of the unseen and the seen. HE is the One Who is Great, the One Who is High/Exalted","13:10":"The one among you who speaks secretively, the one who speaks openly, the one who hides by night and the one who moves about freely by day — they are all the same for Allah; nothing can escape His notice","13:11":"For every human being there are angels who take turns, in front of him/her and behind, to guard him/her by Allah's command. Allah does indeed not change the condition of a people until they themselves change it. And when Allah wills adversity on a people, there is no averting it. And besides Him they have no ruling authority to defend and take care of them","13:12":"He it is Who shows you the lightning that causes both fear and hope. And He it is Who brings up the heavy cloud","13:13":"And the thunder proclaims His glory with His praise, and the angels stand in awe of Him. And He sends the thunderbolts and hits with them whom He wills. And they quarrel among themselves about Allah, whereas He is extremely powerful","13:14":"To Him is the true prayer! And those whom they pray to besides Allah give them no response on anything. It is just like one stretching his two hands out for water to reach his mouth, but it reaches not. And the prayer of those who suppress the Truth is nothing but an illusion","13:15":"And to Allah does prostrate everything in the heavens and the earth, willingly and unwillingly, as their shadows do morning and evening","13:16":"Ask, \"Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?\" Say, \"Allah.\" Ask, \"Do you take then, besides Him, awliya who have no control over any profit and loss to themselves?\" Ask, \"Are the blind and those able to see alike? Or can the darknesses and the light be equal? Or have they set up gods besides Allah, who have made creation like He has, and, as a result, the creation creates confusion for them?\" Say, \"Allah is the Creator of all things. And He is the One and Only, the Almighty","13:17":"He sends down water from the sky. And valleys flow with water as per their given measure. And the stream bears the swelling froth. And from what they melt in the fire for making ornaments or apparatus arises similar froth. Thus does Allah compare truth with untruth. Then, as for the froth, it just passes away as a worthless thing. And as for that which profits the people, it remains on the earth. Thus does Allah explain things giving examples","13:18":"The good is for those who respond to their Lord. And as for those who do not respond to Him, had they all that is in the earth and the like thereof with it, they would certainly offer it for a ransom. An evil reckoning shall await them and their abode shall be Hell — the worst place to rest in","13:19":"Is he who knows that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, then, like him who is blind?Only those endowed with insight will ponder on this","13:20":"Those that fulfill the promise to Allah and break not the covenant","13:21":"And those who maintain all the proper relationships that Allah has commanded to be maintained and fear their Lord and dread a bad account of their own deeds","13:22":"And those who exercise patience seeking the pleasure of their Lord, establish regular prayer, spend out of what We have given them secretly and openly, and repel evil with good. For them is the ultimate/best abode","13:23":"The gardens of perpetual abode which they will enter along with those who had done good deeds from among their parents and their spouses and their offspring. And the angels will enter in upon them from every gate, saying","13:24":"Peace on you because you exercised patience. How excellent, then, is the ultimate/best abode","13:25":"And those that break the pledge with Allah after affirming it, sever ties that Allah has ordered to be honoured and spread corruption in the land — for them there is the curse and the wicked abode","13:26":"Allah provides — in abundance or in short measure — for whom He wills. And they rejoice the life of this world, and the life of this world is nothing but a delusion in the Hereafter","13:27":"And those who suppress the Truth say, \"Why is not a sign sent down upon him from his Lord?\" Say, \"Allah does indeed let him go astray whom He wills. And He guides to Himself those who turn to Him","13:28":"Those who believe and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of Allah! Surely, in Allah's remembrance hearts do find satisfaction","13:29":"Those that believe and do good deeds — for them, a state of happiness and a good place to return to","13:30":"Just as We had sent Messengers to their peoples before, We have sent you to these people now, so that you recite to them what We have revealed to you. And they have been suppressing their belief in the Gracious Being! Say, \"He is my Lord. There is no god but Him. In Him do I trust and to Him is my return","13:31":"And the suppressors of the Truth like to think that they would believe if only the mountains were moved by the Qur'aan, or the earth was cut asunder thereby, or the dead were made to speak! But it is Allah Who can do anything and everything. Have the believers then become despaired of the Truth that had Allah so willed, He could have guided all mankind!? And disaster shall not cease to afflict those that suppress the Truth because of what they do, or to strike near their homes, until what Allah has promised comes to pass. And, indeed, Allah fails not to keep the appointment","13:32":"And Messengers that came before you did get mocked at. And I gave those that suppressed the Truth a long rope, and then seized them. And what a punishment it was","13:33":"And they worship others besides Allah — the One Who is ever alert over what everybody does and accordingly deserves! Say, \"Name them!\" Or, do they tell Him something on the earth of which He is not aware? Or, is it just a show that they make with the words they utter? Nay, the intrigue indulged in by the suppressors of the Truth is made to look pleasing to them and they are held back from the Right Path. And him whom Allah has led astray, no one can guide","13:34":"For them a punishment in the life of this world. And the punishment of the Hereafter is certainly harder. And, there is none to defend them against Allah","13:35":"Some of the things provided in the Garden promised to those who fear Allah: rivers flowing underneath, its fruits and shade everlasting. This is what those who fear Allah shall get in the end. And those who suppress the Truth shall end up in the Fire","13:36":"And those to whom We have given the Book rejoice in that which has been revealed to you. And among groups of people there are some who deny a part of it. Say, \"I am commanded that I should worship only Allah and none else. Him I pray to and to Him I return","13:37":"And thus have We revealed it as the divine code of conduct for humanity in Arabic. And if you follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, you shall have neither any wali nor anyone to defend you against Allah","13:38":"And We had certainly sent Messengers before you and gave them wives and children. And no Messenger could bring a sign save by Allah's leave. , For every age there is a Book decreed","13:39":"Allah obliterates or preserves what He wills. And with Him is the Master Copy of the (or the Original) Book","13:40":"And whether We let you see part of what We promise them or We cause you to die before that, your responsibility is only the delivery of the divine Message, and it is for Us to call them to account","13:41":"Do they not see that We are closing in on them from all sides? And Allah judges; His judgment is irrevocable. And He is swift to keeping accounts","13:42":"And those before them did make plans, but all planning is Allah's. He knows what every one earns, and those who suppress the Truth shall come to know for whom the Ultimate Abode is","13:43":"And those who suppress the Truth say, \"You are not a Messenger of Allah.\" Say, \"Allah — and whoever has knowledge of the Book — is a sufficient witness between me and you","14:1":"Alif Lam Ra. A Book that We have revealed to you to bring out mankind, by their Lord's permission, from darknesses towards light — towards the way of the Omnipotent, the Praised One","14:2":"Allah is He to Whom belongs whatever there is in the heavens and the earth. And woe, from severe punishment, unto those who suppress the Truth","14:3":"Those who love the life of this world more than the Hereafter, and turn people away from Allah's Path and seek perversity in it. They are in deep delusion","14:4":"And We did not send any Messenger with Our Message but in the language of his people, so that he might narrate it to them clearly. Allah then leaves whom He wills to stray away from His Path and He guides whom He wills to His Path. And He is the Omnipotent, the Wise","14:5":"And We did certainly send Moses with Our signs, \"Bring out your people from the darknesses towards light and remind them of the annals of Allah. Therein indeed are signs for everyone who is patient and grateful","14:6":"And when Moses said to his people, \"Remember Allah's favour upon you when He delivered you from Pharaoh's people who had subjected you to severe persecution, and killed your sons and spared your women. And in this there was a great test from your Lord","14:7":"And when your Lord declared, \"If you are grateful, I will certainly give you more. And if you are ungrateful, My punishment is indeed severe","14:8":"And Moses said, \"Even if you are ungrateful — you and those on earth all together — Allah certainly indeed can do without you being grateful to Him. HE is Self-sufficient, Praiseworthy","14:9":"Have you not heard of those before you — of the people of Noah and AAad and Thamood, and those after them? None knows them but Allah. Their Messengers came to them with clear signs. And they thrust their hands into their mouths in astonishment while witnessing those signs, but said, \"We do not believe in the Message that you are sent with, and we are indeed utterly in doubt about what you invite us to","14:10":"Their Messengers said, \"Is there any doubt about Allah, the Maker of the heavens and the earth? He invites you to Him so that He may forgive you your sins and give you time till an appointed term to redeem yourselves.\" They said, \"You are but mortals like us. You wish to turn us away from what our fathers worshipped. Bring to us then some clear evidence for this","14:11":"Their Messengers said to them, \"We are but mortals like you, but Allah bestows His favours upon whom He wills of His worshippers. And we cannot bring you any evidence except by Allah's permission. And in Allah then the believers should have trust","14:12":"And what reason have we that we should have no trust in Allah, when, surely, He has guided us to our paths? And we shall certainly bear your persecution with patience. And those that trust do trust in Allah","14:13":"And those who suppressed the Truth told their Messengers, \"We shall drive you out of our land, or you shall come back into our lifestyle.\" Their Lord then revealed to them, \"We will destroy the wicked people","14:14":"And We shall certainly settle you in the land after them. This is for him who fears standing in My presence and who fears My warnings","14:15":"And they sought victory and every obstinate tyrant was frustrated","14:16":"Behind him [every obstinate tyrant] is Hell waiting to quench his thirst with fetid water","14:17":"He will sip at it and it will not be easy for him to swallow it. And death will come to him from every quarter, but he shall not die. And further severe punishment shall await just behind him","14:18":"Deeds of those who suppress the Truth about their Lord are like ashes on which the wind blows hard on a stormy day. They shall have no power over any thing they earn. This is far too grievous a loss of way","14:19":"Do you not see that Allah created the heavens and the earth in Truth? If He wills He will take you off and bring a new creation","14:20":"And this is not at all difficult for Allah","14:21":"And they shall all present themselves before Allah. Then the weak shall say to those who were proud, \"We had indeed been your followers. Would you then withstand anything of Allah's punishment from us?\" They would say, \"If Allah had guided us, we too would have guided you. It is immaterial to us now whether we bewail or be patient. There is no place for us to escape to","14:22":"And the Satan shall say after the Judgment is pronounced, \"Allah did indeed give you the true promise. And I gave you promises, but failed to keep them. And I had no authority over you except to call you to me, and you obeyed me! So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot be of any help to you now, nor can you be of any help to me. I do indeed deny that you had worshipped me, besides Allah, before.\" For the wicked people there shall indeed be a painful punishment","14:23":"And those who believe and do good deeds shall be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow. They shall stay eternally therein by their Lord's leave. Their greeting therein shall be, \"Peace","14:24":"Don't you see how Allah exemplifies a good word as a good tree with firm roots and with its branches spread out in the sky","14:25":"Yielding its fruits every season by its Lord's leave?

By Allah, you shall most certainly be questioned about that which you have been concocting","16:57":"And they arbitrarily attribute daughters (angels) to Allah. HE is too glorious to have any such creaturely attribute.

Shall he keep it despite the disgrace, or bury it in the dust? Verily, their judgment is vicious","16:60":"An example of evil applies to those who believe not in the Hereafter. And the best/loftiest example applies to Allah. And He is the Omnipotent, the Wise","16:61":"And had Allah seized mankind for their unjust acts, He would not have left, on the earth, even a single creature. But He gives them a definite time limit. And when their time comes, they shall not be able to postpone it for a moment nor prepone it","16:62":"And they assign to Allah what they hate for themselves. And their tongues philosophically cover up the lie to say that for them there shall be nothing but the good. There is no doubt that for them there shall be the Fire and that they shall be hastened thereto","16:63":"By Allah, We did certainly send Messengers to peoples that existed before you. Then the Satan made their deeds seem good to them. And he became their walihof the day (period). And they shall have a painful punishment","16:64":"And We have not sent down the Book to you but to make clear to them what they differ in, and as Guidance and Mercy for people who believe","16:65":"And Allah it is Who sends down water from the sky and therewith gives life to the earth after its death.

We give you pure, potable drink of milk out of what they consume in their bellies, and drawn from excreta and blood. a","16:67":"And from the fruits of the palm-tree and the vine, you get intoxication as well as good food. There is indeed a sign in this for a people who ponder","16:68":"And your Lord inspired the bee to \"have hives in the mountains, in the trees and in the buildings","16:69":"And then eat of all the fruits and tread the paths of your Lord submissively.\" A beverage of various colours comes forth from within it, wherein there is curative value for mankind. There is indeed a sign in this for people who reflect","16:70":"And Allah it is Who has created you. It is He then Who causes you to die. And among you there may be someone who, after having acquired knowledge, is reduced to such a decrepit state of life that he knows nothing. Allah is indeed Knowledgeable, Powerful","16:71":"And it is Allah Who has given some of you more/better provisions than to others. Would then those who are thus favoured give away their provisions to their slaves so that they become equal therein? Do they then deny this privilege that Allah has given them","16:72":"And it is Allah Who has made spouses for you from among yourselves, and through your spouses He has given you sons, daughters and their further families. And He has provided wholesome food for you. Do they believe then in the falsehood and suppress the fact that it is Allah Who has given them the good things they enjoy","16:73":"And they worship, besides Allah, those that possess nothing, in the heavens and the earth, wherewith to sustain their worshippers. Nor have those any power to possess anything","16:74":"So liken not anything to Allah! Indeed, Allah knows and you do not","16:75":"Allah gives an example: a slave — property of another person — who has no power over anything, and, on the other hand, a free man whom We have given a good provision from Ourselves and he spends from it secretly and openly. Are the two alike? To Allah is due all praise! But, most of them know not","16:76":"And Allah gives another example, of two men, one of whom is dumb, unable to do anything, and a burden on his master. He is not good at whatever task the master gives him. Can he be held equal to him who enjoins what is just, and is himself on the right path","16:77":"And with Allah is the knowledge of the unseen/secrets of the heavens and the earth. And the happening of the Hour is but as a momentary sight or consuming even less time. Allah indeed can do anything","16:78":"And it is Allah Who brought you out from the wombs of your mothers, knowing nothing. And He gave you hearing and sight and intellect that you may be grateful","16:79":"See they not how the birds are enabled to be in mid-air above? None keeps them there but Allah! Indeed, there are signs in this for people who believe","16:80":"And Allah has facilitated for you rest, security and solace in your houses. And He has facilitated for you tents.of the skins of cattle which you find light to carry when you travel and when you stay out. And of the animal wool, fur and hair, He has given you assets and possessions for a time","16:81":"And Allah has made for you shelters from what He has created, and places of retreat in the mountains. And He has provided for garments for you to protect you from the heat and for armour to protect you in your armed conflicts. Thus does He complete His favour upon you in order that you submit to Him","16:82":"And if, even then, they turn away, the responsibility on you (Prophet Muhammad) is only to deliver Allah's Message clearly to the people","16:83":"They are aware of Allah's favour, yet they deny it!

Then shall no leeway be given to those who suppress the Truth, nor shall they be allowed to solicit favours","16:85":"And when those who are wicked experience the punishment, its severity on them shall not be decreased, nor shall they be given any respite","16:86":"And when those who worship others besides Allah see those others, they shall say, \"Our Lord! These are our other gods whom we prayed to besides You.\" But they will retort, \"Certainly indeed you are liars","16:87":"And they shall tender submission to Allah on that day. And what they used to concoct shall depart from them","16:88":"For those who suppress the Truth and cause hindrance in Allah's Path, We will add punishment over punishment because they have been spreading corruption","16:89":"And One Day We will raise in every people a witness against them from among themselves, and bring you as a witness against these. And We have revealed to you the Book explaining everythingclearly, and as a guidance, mercy and good news for those who submit","16:90":"Allah does indeed enjoin justice, kindness and giving things to near and dear ones. And He forbids obscenity, abomination and rebellion. He admonishes you that you may remember and take heed","16:91":"And fulfill Allah's covenant when you make one. And break not oaths after affirming them; for, then, you have indeed made Allah stand surety for you. Allah does indeed know what you do","16:92":"And be not like the woman who disintegrates her well-spun yarn into fibres.You take your oaths as means of interference in one another's affairs so that one community gets bigger than another. Allah has not but put you on trial by this; and He will certainly make clear to you, on the Resurrection Day, that, about which you differed","16:93":"And if Allah had so willed, He would certainly have made you a single community. But He causes whom He wills to go astray and guides whom He wills to go on the Right Path. And you will certainly be questioned as to what you did","16:94":"And take not your oaths as means of interference in one another's affairs, lest a footstep should stumble after it is firmly taken and you should taste adversity because you hindered someone from Allah's Path.

And they shall have a painful punishment","16:105":"Those that believe not in Allah's Messages, it is they who concoct the lie. And those are the liars","16:106":"Allah's Wrath is on people who deny Allah after having believed in Him, not on those compelled while their hearts are at rest with faith, but on those that open their minds to suppression of the Truth. And they shall have the most severe punishment","16:107":"That is because they love this worldly life more than the Hereafter, and because Allah does not guide people who suppress the Truth","16:108":"These are the people on whose hearts, hearing and eyes Allah has set a seal. And they take no heed","16:109":"No doubt, in the Hereafter, they will be the doomed ones","16:110":"And then, on the other hand, your Lord is indeed Forgiving and Merciful on those who migrate after they are persecuted, then struggle hard and are patient","16:111":"On that Day every one shall come, pleading for one's own self. And every one shall be paid one's full dues, and they shall not be wronged","16:112":"And Allah gives an example of a village/town, safe and secure, to which its means of subsistence came in abundance from every quarter.

And We will bring out for him on the Resurrection Day a record thrown wide open","17:14":"Read your record! You yourself are sufficient as an auditor against you this day","17:15":"One that goes on the right path does so for one's own self. And one that goes astray does so to one's own detriment. And no bearer of a burden bears the burden of another, nor do We punish until We send a Messenger","17:16":"And when We wish to destroy a town, We send Our commandment to its wealthy people who lead easy lives, but they defiantly disobey!

And your Lord has a sufficient knowledge of and is a sufficient Witness to His subjects' faults/mistakes/sins","17:18":"As for one who desires instant gains in this present life, We do hasten therein, to whom We will, what We please.

And, of course, the Hereafter is much superior in ranks and favours","17:22":"Worship none but Allah lest you remain disgraced, forsaken","17:23":"And your Lord has commanded that you shall worship none but Him, and that you shall be good to your parents. If either or both of them reach old age while with you, you shall not utter even a word of the slightest annoyance or reproach to them. And speak to them kindly","17:24":"And be submissively and compassionately protective of them, and pray, `O my Lord! Have mercy on them as they had brought me up during my childhood","17:25":"Your Lord knows what is in your minds. If you are good, then He does indeed forgive those who often turn to Him in penitence","17:26":"And give to the near of kin his/her due, and to the needy and the wayfarer their dues. And be not a spendthrift","17:27":"Indeed, the spendthrifts are brothers of the satanic people and the Satan is ever ungrateful to his Lord","17:28":"And if you are not in a position to help them out and you are yourself seeking mercy from your Lord, speak to them a kind word","17:29":"And do not make your hand tied to your neck nor extend it to its utmost limit, lest you should be left blamed and impoverished","17:30":"Your Lord does indeed enlarge means of subsistence for those He wills and restrict for those He wills. He does indeed have full knowledge of and does constantly keep watch on His creatures that always ought to obey Him","17:31":"And kill not your children for fear of poverty. We give them sustenance as We give it to you. Killing them is indeed a great wrong","17:32":"And go not near fornication/adultery! It is indeed an abomination and an evil path","17:33":"And do not kill any one, whose killing Allah has forbidden, unless duly authorized to do so.

And you will think that you had remained in the grave for only a little while","17:53":"And say to My human creatures, who all ought to obey Me, that they speak that which is most appropriate and proper.

And We have not sent you as the manager of their affairs","17:55":"And your Lord knows those who are in the heavens and the earth. And We have certainly favoured some of the prophets over others.

They cannot remove the distress from you nor can they change it","17:57":"They themselves — whom they call upon — seek the means of getting closest, among themselves, to their Lord.

We will increase the intensity of the blazing Fire, whenever it abates, for them","17:98":"This is their retribution because they suppressed the truth of Our Messages/Verses/Signs and because they said, \"What! When we shall have become bones and dust, shall we then indeed be raised up as a new creation","17:99":"Do they not see that Allah — Who created the heavens and the earth and appointed an end for them wherein there in no doubt — is able to create their like?hBut the wicked people do not but suppress the Truth","17:100":"Say, \"Even if you were in control of the treasures of the Mercy of my Lord, you would miserly hold on to it for fear of exhausting it. And man is stingy","17:101":"And We did give Moses nine clear signs. Ask the Children of Israel about them. When he came to them, Pharaoh told him, \"I do indeed consider you, O Moses, to be a man bewitched","17:102":"Moses said, \"You do know that none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth has sent down these as clear evidence.

They speak nothing but a lie","18:6":"Then maybe you (Prophet) will kill yourself with grief, on their account, if they do not believe in this Pronouncement (Qur'aan)","18:7":"We have indeed made whatever is on the earth as an adornment for it, and We put them on trial to see which of them do good deeds","18:8":"And We will indeed turn everything thereon into barren soil","18:9":"Did you perchance consider the Men of the Cave and the story about them as among Our extraordinary signs","18:10":"When the youths sought refuge in the cave, they said, \"Our Lord! Grant us mercy from Thee, and facilitate for us the right course in our affair","18:11":"So We put a seal on their ears for a number of years in the cave","18:12":"Then We raised them up to see which of the two groups was best able to compute the time they had remained there in their unconscious state","18:13":"We relate to you their story in truth. They were indeed youths who believed in their Lord and We favoured them with more guidance","18:14":"And We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said, \"Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We pray not to any god besides Him; for, then, certainly, we would have uttered an abominable thing","18:15":"These, our people, have taken gods besides Him! Why do they not produce any clear evidence in their support? Is there, then, anyone committing a greater wrong than one who concocts a lie against Allah","18:16":"And when you leave them and what they worship besides Allah, go to the cave for refuge. Your Lord will extend His mercy to you and facilitate ease in your affair","18:17":"And you would see the sun bypass their cave, as it rose in the morning on the right; and as it declined in the afternoon on the left, it would pass them by while they lay in the spacious space in the cave. This is one of the signs of Allah. The one whom Allah guides, is the one rightly guided, and the one whom He misleads, you shall not find for that one any wali to direct him to the right path","18:18":"And you might think them awake, but they were asleep. And We made them turn to the right side and to the left, and their dog squatted on its outstretched forelegs at the entrance. Had you come upon them you would certainly have run away from them, and you would certainly have been overwhelmed with fear of them","18:19":"And so We roused them to make enquiries among themselves. One of them asked, \"How long have you been here?\" They said, \"We have been here for a day or less than a day.\" Some said, \"Your Lord alone knows how long you have been. Now send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the city, and let him find and bring some good food for you. And let him ensure that none comes to know about you","18:20":"For indeed if they should find you out, they would stone you to death or force you back into their religion. And, then, you will never get salvation","18:21":"And thus We made people to stumble upon them (the Men of the Cave) that they (people) might know — when they quarrelled among themselves in their affair — that Allah's promise is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour. And they (the people who came to know the story of the Men of the Cave) said, \"Erect a monument over them.\" Their Lord is well aware of them. Those who had authority over people's affairs said, \"We will certainly raise a place of worship over them","18:22":"Some of the people would later say, \"They (the Men of the Cave) were three, the fourth being their dog.\" and some others would say, \"Five, the sixth being their dog,\" making conjectures about what is unknown. And still others would say, \"Seven, and the eighth was their dog.\" Say, \"My Lord knows their number. None but a few know it. So argue not about them except for what you do know, and make no enquiries concerning them with any of the people","18:23":"And never say about anything, \"I will indeed do it tomorrow","18:24":"Without adding, \"If Allah pleases.\" And remember your Lord when you forget and say, \"Maybe my Lord will guide me to better conduct than this","18:25":"And they remained in their cave for three hundred years and some add nine to the number","18:26":"Say, \"Allah knows how long they remained. To Him belong secrets of the heavens and the earth. HE sees them and He hears! There is no walih for them besides Him, and He does not share His Sovereignty with any one","18:27":"And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord! There is none who can alter His words. And you shall find no provider of shelter besides Him","18:28":"And be yourself patient with those who pray to their Lord, morning and evening, desiring His good pleasure. And let not your eyes stray away from them, desiring glamour of life in this world. And follow not him whose heart We have made neglectful to Our remembrance and who follows his carnal desires and is reckless in his deeds","18:29":"And say, \"This is the truth from your Lord. So he who wants to, let him believe, and he who wants to, let him suppress the Truth.\" We have indeed prepared for those who indulge in wrong-doing a fire, the flames of which shall encompass them. And if they cry for help, they shall be given water like molten brass which will scald their faces. What a miserable drink and what a miserable resting-place","18:30":"We shall indeed not let the reward, of those who believe and do good, go waste","18:31":"These it is for whom are gardens of perpetuity beneath which rivers flow. Reclined comfortably on decorated couches, they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and they will wear green robes of fine silk and heavy brocade. What an excellent reward and how beautiful a resting place","18:32":"And tell them the parable of two men. For one of them We made two gardens of grape vines, and We bordered them both with date-palms. And between the two gardens We made cornfields","18:33":"Each of the gardens yielded its fruits, and nothing went wrong therein. And We caused a spring to gush forth in their midst","18:34":"And he had good yield. So he said to his companion in a conversation with him, \"I have more wealth than you, and I command greater respect among the people","18:35":"And he entered his garden; and he was unfair to himself. He said, \"I do not think that this will ever perish","18:36":"And I do not think the Hour will ever occur. And even if I am returned to my Lord I will certainly find there a better place than this","18:37":"His companion answered, \"Do you deny Him Who created you from dust, then from a tiny seed of fertilized ovum and then shaped you into a man","18:38":"But as for me, He, Allah, is my Lord, and I do not associate anyone with my Lord","18:39":"And why did you not say when you entered your garden that it is as Allah has willed and that there is no power but with Allah? If you see me inferior to you in wealth and children","18:40":"Then maybe my Lord will give me something better than your garden, and send a thunderbolt from heaven on your garden so that it shall become just a barren land","18:41":"Or its waters should sink deep into the ground so that you are unable to find it","18:42":"And the yield of his gardens was caught in a disastrous wave of destruction. And he started wringing his hands for his investments therein, which had turned upside down. And he said, \"Alas! I should not have associated anyone with my Lord","18:43":"And he had no manpower to help him besides Allah, nor could he help himself","18:44":"There! Allah is the only True Wali. He is best in giving rewards and the best to go to in the end","18:45":"And tell them that the life of this world is like water which We send down from the sky. Spring forth therewith all kinds of vegetation on the earth. Then it (vegetation) becomes dry and brittle and the winds scatter it. And Allah has the ability to do all things","18:46":"Wealth and children are but an adornment of the life of this world. And the abiding good deeds are better, for reward and hope, with your Lord","18:47":"And on the Day when We will cause the mountains to move away and you will see the barren earth, We will gather them and leave none of them behind","18:48":"And they shall be lined up before your Lord. \"Verily, you have come to Us in the state We created you at first. But you had thought that We had not fixed any appointment for you","18:49":"And the Book shall be produced. And you will see the sinners scared of its contents. And they will say, \"Oh, woe to us! What a book is this! It omits nothing, small or big, but mentions them all.\" And whatever they had done, they shall find it there. And your Lord causes no wrong to anyone","18:50":"And when We asked the angels to prostrate to Adam, they all did prostrate, but Iblees did not! e was a jinni, and he swerved from the commandment of his Lord. Would you then take him and his progeny, rather than Me, as awliya, and they are your enemies? What a miserable exchange for the wrongdoers","18:51":"I did not make them witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor of the creation of their own selves. And there was no question of my taking those who mislead as helping hands","18:52":"And on the Day when He shall say, \"Call those whom you considered to be My associates!\" So they shall call them, but they shall not respond to them. And We shall place a destructive barrier between them","18:53":"And the sinners shall see the Fire, and they shall know that they are going to fall into it. And they shall find no way out therefrom","18:54":"And We have certainly explained in this Quran, for the benefit of mankind, examples of every kind. And man is, in most things, quarrelsome","18:55":"And nothing prevents people from believing and asking forgiveness of their Lord — when the guidance has already come to them — except that what happened to the ancient peoples should overtake them or that the punishment should confront them","18:56":"And We do not send Messengers but as givers of good news and of warnings. And those who suppress the Truth resort to falsehoods that they may extinguish the truth thereby. And they hold My Verses/signs and warnings in ridicule","18:57":"And who is worse in wickness than he who is reminded of the Verses/signs of his Lord, but turns away therefrom and forgets what his two hands have sent before ? We have indeedh placed covers over their hearts, and deafness in their ears, lest they should understand it (Lord's Verses/signs). And if you call them to guidance, they will not follow it ever","18:58":"And your Lord is Forgiving, full of Mercy. Was He to catch them for what they earn, He would certainly have hastened the punishment for them. But there is an appointed time for them from which they shall find no escape","18:59":"And these towns We destroyed when they acted unjustly — We had fixed an appointed time for their destruction","18:60":"And when Moses said to the youth accompanying him, \"I will not stop until I reach the confluence of two rivers even if I have to continue this journey for a long time","18:61":"So when they reached the confluence, they forgot their fish, and it burrowed its way into the sea","18:62":"But when they had gone farther, he said to his young companion, \"Take out our breakfast. We have certainly met with fatigue in this journey of ours","18:63":"The youth said, \"You know when we took some rest on the rock, I forgot about the fish — and nothing but the Satan made me forget to tell you about it — when, strangely, it found its way into the river","18:64":"Moses said, \"That was the spot we had sought for!\" They then retraced their footsteps back to the spot","18:65":"There they found one of Our devotees. We had favoured him with mercy from Us and We had given him some knowledge from Us","18:66":"Moses said to him, \"May I follow you so that you teach me of the right knowledge you have been taught","18:67":"He said, \"You can never have patience with me","18:68":"And how can you have patience in matters over which you do not have comprehensive knowledge","18:69":"He said, \"Allah willing, you shall find me patient and I shall not disobey you in any matter","18:70":"He said, \"If you would follow me, question me not about any thing until I myself speak to you about it","18:71":"And both of them went out on a journey. And there arose no problem between them until when they boarded a boat he (Moses' new companion) made a hole in it. Moses said, \"Have you made a hole in it to drown the people thereon? Certainly you have done a grave thing","18:72":"Moses' companion said, \"Did I not say that you will not be able to have patience with me","18:73":"Moses said, \"Hold me not responsible for a thing I forgot, and burden me not with difficulty in my affair","18:74":"And they both went on until, when they met a boy, he (Moses' companion) killed him. Moses said, \"Have you killed an innocent person otherwise than for manslaughter? Certainly you have done a condemnable thing","18:75":"Moses' companion said, \"Did I not tell you that you will not be able to have patience with me","18:76":"Moses said, \"If I ask you about anything after this, keep me not in your company. Verily, you shall have then an excuse, provided by me, for you to do so","18:77":"And they both went on until, when they came to a town, they requested its people to give them some food, but they refused to feed them as guests. They then found in it a wall which was about to collapse and Moses' companion set it right. Moses said, \"You could certainly have taken some wages for it","18:78":"Moses' companion said, \"This shall be the parting between me and you. I will now inform you of the true perspective of my actions over which you could not have patience","18:79":"As for the boat, it belonged to some poor men who worked on the river. And I wished to make it defective as there was, across them, a king who seized every boat by force","18:80":"And as for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared lest he should trouble them with disobedience and ingratitude","18:81":"So we desired that their Lord would give them in his place a boy better than him in purity and more compassionate","18:82":"And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphaned boys in the city, and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them, and their father was a righteous man. So your Lord desired that they should attain their maturity and take out their treasure as a mercy from your Lord. And I did not do it of my own accord. This is the true perspective of my actions over which you could not have patience","18:83":"And they ask you about Zulqarnain. Say, \"I will recite an account of him to you","18:84":"We did indeed give him authority on earth and means to pursue any thing he did","18:85":"So he followed a means","18:86":"And when he reached a place as the sun declined in the west, he found it declining on a oligotrophic spring. And he found a people living near it. We said, \"O Zulqarnain! Cause them to suffer or treat them well","18:87":"He said, \"We will punish only the one who is wicked. He shall then be returned to his Lord, and He will punish him with a severe punishment","18:88":"And as for him who believes and does good deeds, he shall have good reward, and We will make Our command easy for him","18:89":"Then he followed another means","18:90":"And when he reached a place as the sun rose in the East, he found it rise on a community to whom We had given no shelter therefrom","18:91":"And thus We had put a limit to the knowledge he (Zulqarnain) could have","18:92":"Then he followed yet another means","18:93":"And when he reached a place between two mountains, he found beyond these a people who could hardly understand a word","18:94":"They said, \"O Zulqarnain! Gog and Magog do indeed make mischief in this land. May we then give you expenses so that you raise a barrier between us and them","18:95":"Zulqarnain said, \"What my Lord has given me is better than what you would give me. So you assist me with labour only and I will construct an obstruction between you and them","18:96":"Bring me iron sheets.\" And when he had filled up the gap between the two mountain sides, he said, \"Blow!\" And when he had turned it red hot, he said, \"Bring me molten brass to pour over it","18:97":"So they were not able to scale it nor could they breach it","18:98":"He said, \"This (construction of the barrier/gate) is a mercy from my Lord. But when the prophecy of my Lord comes to pass, He will level it to the ground, and the prophecy of my Lord has ever to come true","18:99":"And, one day, We shall let the different communities of mankind get mixed up with one another like waves.And then the trumpet will be blown, and We shall gather them all together","18:100":"And We shall present the Hell, that Day, for display before those who had suppressed the Truth","18:101":"— Those whose eyes had a cover against seeing My Reminder (Qur'aan) and who were unable to listen to it","18:102":"Do they then who suppress the Truth think that they can take My subjects as awliya, besides Me? We have indeed prepared Hell as the destination of those who suppress the Truth","18:103":"Say, \"Shall We inform you who the greatest losers are in their deeds","18:104":"They are those whose efforts in the life of this world are misdirected and they think that they are doing good work","18:105":"Those are the people who suppress the Truth in the Verses/signs of their Lord and of the appointment with Him. So their deeds have become null and void. And so We will not assign any weightage to their deeds on the Day of Resurrection","18:106":"That Hell is their recompense because they suppressed the Truth and held My Verses/signs and My Messengers in ridicule","18:107":"For those who believe and do good deeds, their bestowal shall indeed be the gardens of paradise","18:108":"They will abide therein; they will never seek any transfer therefrom","18:109":"Say, \"If the sea were ink for the words of my Lord, the sea would surely be exhausted before the words of my Lord are exhausted, though We were to bring the like of it (sea) in aid","18:110":"Say, \"I am only a man like you.

How can I have a son, and my wife is barren, and I have myself grown too old","19:9":"[The divine response was,] \"So shall it be. Your Lord says, `It is not at all difficult for Me, and indeed I created you before, when you were nothing","19:10":"Zachariah said, \"My Lord! Give me a sign.\" The Lord said, \"Your sign is that you will not be able to speak to the people for three consecutive nights","19:11":"So he came out to his people from the chamber, then he communicated to them, through signs, that they should glorify Allah morning and evening","19:12":"O John! Hold on to the Book firmly.\" And We granted him the authority over men while he was yet a child","19:13":"And We gave him the gift of compassion from Us and of purity, and he feared Allah","19:14":"And ever courteous to his parents, he was never insolent, disobedient","19:15":"And peace on him on the day he was born, the day he dies, and the day he is raised to life again","19:16":"And mention Mary in the Book when she withdrew from her family to stay at a place towards the East","19:17":"And she screened herself from them, and We sent to her Our spirit, and it appeared before her as a man well-made","19:18":"She said, \"I do indeed seek the Gracious Allah's protection against you, if you do really fear Allah","19:19":"He said, \"I am a Messenger of your Lord: I am sent to give you a gem of a boy","19:20":"She said, \"How can I have a boy when no man has ever touched me?

We did verily deliver you from your enemy, and We made a covenant with you on the right side of the mountain, and We sent to you the manna and the quails","20:81":"Make use of the good things We have provided you with, and be not inordinate therein lest My wrath should become due upon you. And he, upon whom My wrath becomes due, certainly perishes","20:82":"And I am indeed most forgiving to him who repents and believes and does good deeds, and then follows the right direction","20:83":"And what made you come here earlier than your people, O Moses","20:84":"Moses said, \"They are close behind me. And I hastened to You, my Lord, that You might be pleased","20:85":"Allah said, \"But then We put your people on trial after you had left them behind, and the Samiri has led them astray","20:86":"Then Moses returned to his people, angry and sorrowful. He Said, \"O my people! Did not your Lord give you a good promise? Did then the time for fulfillment of the promise seem too long to you? Or did you wish to incur wrath from your Lord, so you broke your promise to me","20:87":"They said, \"We did not break our promise to you of our own accord, but we were made to bear the burden of the ornaments of the people. So we got rid of that burden just as the Samiri did","20:88":"Then he (Samiri) brought out for them a body of a calf, from which emanated a low sound. Then he told them, \"This is your god and the god of Moses. But he (Moses) has forgotten it","20:89":"Could they not see that it did not respond to them at all, and that it did have no power to do any harm or to bring any benefit to them","20:90":"And certainly had Aaron told them earlier, \"O my people! You are only being tried therewith. And, indeed, your Lord is the Gracious One.

Seize me not by my beard and by my head. I was indeed afraid you might say, `You have caused a rift among the children of Israel and not waited for my word","20:95":"Moses then asked, \"What have you to say on this, O Samiri","20:96":"He said, \"I saw what they did not see. And I took a handful of traces from the messenger and flung it. And this is what my own self prompted me to do","20:97":"Moses said, \"Begone! Indeed, it is ordained for you in this life to say, `Touch me not!' And indeed there is a prediction for you that shall not fail. And look at your god that you hovered around!

Shall I show you the tree of immortality and a kingdom that shall not decay","20:121":"And they both succumbed to the satanic seduction, and then their sexuality got opened to them, and they both began to cover themselves with leaves of the garden. And Adam disobeyed his Lord and thus deviated from the right path","20:122":"Then his Lord chose him, so He accepted his repentance and guided him","20:123":"Allah said, \"Down you both (Adam & Satan) go, together, in reciprocal enmity. And whenever Guidance comes to you from Me, then all those who follow My Guidance shall not go astray or be miserable","20:124":"And he who turns away from My Reminder shall lead a hard life. and We will raiseh him on the Day of Resurrection, blind","20:125":"He will say, \"My Lord! Why have You raised me blind? And I was certainly one able to see","20:126":"Allah will say, \"Just as Our Verses/signs came to you but you neglected them, so shall you be neglected this day","20:127":"And thus do We recompense him who is negligent and believes not in the Verses/signs of his Lord. And certainly the punishment in the Hereafter is severe and abiding","20:128":"Do they not take a lesson from the fact that We had destroyed many a generation before theirs, in whose dwelling-places they now move about? Indeed, there are signs in this for those who are prudent","20:129":"And had it not been that the Word had already gone forth from your Lord and an appointed term fixed, the same fate (of destruction in this world) that the earlier generations met with, would certainly be theirs (the generation addressed to in this Verse) too","20:130":"Exercise patience then over what they say.

And glorify Him, during the night and during parts of the day, so that you get peace of mind","20:131":"And covet not that — which We have provided some couples among them with — of the glitter of this worldly life, whereby We try them. And what the Lord provides you with is better and lasting","20:132":"And enjoin prayer on your followers, and be regular and steadfast thereon. We do not ask you for any provision; We give it to you. And in the end it is those who fear Allah, and abide by His instructions, that get all the good things to enjoy","20:133":"And they say, \"Why does he not bring to us a sign from his Lord?\" Has not there come to them a clear exposition of what the earlier scriptures contain","20:134":"And had We destroyed them with punishment before this, they would certainly have said, \"O our Lord! Why did You not send us a Messenger? For, we should then have followed Your Verses/signs before we met disgrace and shame","20:135":"Say, \"Everyone is waiting, so you too wait! You will soon come to know who is following the right path and who is guided","21:1":"For the human beings, their time of reckoning is near, and yet they pass their time in utter recklessness.h","21:2":"No aspect of divinity comes to them from their Lord in the form of a fresh anecdote but they listen to it in jest","21:3":"Just to serve as a distraction for their minds. And the wicked people secretly whisper, \"Is he not just a man like you? Will you then knowingly yield to the magic spell","21:4":"The Prophet said, \"My Lord knows every word spoken anywhere in the heavens and the earth. And He is the One to hear and the One to know everything","21:5":"But they variously said, \"Just a confusing mixture of dreams!\" \"But he has forged it.\" \"But he is a poet.\" \"Let him then bring to us a sign just as the earlier prophets were sent with","21:6":"Any town/village that We had destroyed before them, too, had not believed! Will they, taking this fact into account at least, believe","21:7":"And We sent (as Prophets/Messengers for mankind), before you, none but men inspired with Our Revelation. Ask the people of the Reminder (divinely revealed Book) if you do not know","21:8":"And We had not made them bodies that did not eat food, and they were not immortal","21:9":"And We made Our promise good to them; We saved them and those whom We pleased, and We destroyed the transgressors","21:10":"Verily We have revealed to you a Book in which are things for you to ponder over, remember and abide by. Do you then not use your intelligence to understand it","21:11":"And many a town/village, whose inhabitants were cruel, did We shatter, and We raised up, thereafter, another people","21:12":"No sooner did they perceive Our punishment coming than they began to flee therefrom","21:13":"Flee not, and come back to the affluence you were accustomed to live in and to your homes for being questioned","21:14":"They said, \"O woe to us! We were wicked","21:15":"And this cry of theirs continued till We made them like smouldering harvested field","21:16":"And We did not create the heavens and the earth, and what is between them, for fun","21:17":"Had We wished to have some amusement, We would have derived it from within Ourselves, if at all.h","21:18":"Nay! We cast the truth against the falsehood to demolish it (falsehood). And lo! Falsehood perishes. And woe to you for the (wrong) way you perceive things","21:19":"And whoever is in the heavens and the earth is His.

Glorified then is Allah, the Lord of the Throne, above all that they attribute to Him","21:23":"He cannot be questioned concerning what He does but they (human beings) shall be","21:24":"Or have they taken gods other than Him? Say, \"Produce your evidence! This is the precept (that there is no god besides Allah) for those with me and the precept for those before me.\" But most of them do not know the truth, and so they are intransigent","21:25":"And We did not send before you any Messenger but We revealed to him that there is no god but I, and so worship Me","21:26":"And they say, \"The Gracious One has begotten (angels)!\" Glorified is He. Nay! They are His honoured worshippers","21:27":"They do not speak ahead of Him and they act at His Command","21:28":"HE knows what they know of and what they do not know of. And they intercede not except for him whom He wills and they are on their guard in awe of Him","21:29":"And whoever of them says that he is indeed a god besides Him, We award Hell to such a one. We do thus award the wicked people","21:30":"Do those who suppress the Truth not see that the heavens and the earth were both one in kind, and then We did distinguish the two.

And We have made therein passes to enable people to move about and find their way","21:32":"And We have made the sky a protective roof and yet they are oblivious to its signs","21:33":"And He it is Who created the night and the day, the sun and the moon. All in orbit float","21:34":"And We did not ordain immortality for any man before you. And so if you die, will they remain alive","21:35":"Every one must taste death. And We test you with trial periods of adversity and prosperity. And to Us you shall be brought back","21:36":"And when those who suppress the Truth see you, they do not take you but for one to be scoffed at, \"Is this the one who talks of your gods?\" And they suppress mention of the Gracious One","21:37":"Man is created hasty in nature. Soon shall I show you My signs. So be not hasty","21:38":"And they ask, \"When will this prediction come to pass if what you say is true","21:39":"Had those who suppress the Truth but known that a time would come when they shall not be able to ward off the fire from their faces or from their backs! And then they shall get no help","21:40":"But it (the time mentioned in Verse above) shall come on them all of a sudden and catch them unawares. And they shall not be able to avert it. And they shall not be given any respite","21:41":"And certainly Messengers before you were scoffed at. But then the thing they mocked about surrounded those of them who scoffed","21:42":"Ask them, \"Who can guard you, by night and by day, from the Gracious One?\" And, yet, they turn away at the mention of their Lord","21:43":"Or, have they gods who can defend them against Us? They shall not be able to help themselves. Nor shall they have any benefit of association with Us","21:44":"But, for a prolonged period in their lives, We did provide for them and their fathers with good things of life. Have they therefore become so complacent as not to see that We are closing in on them from all sides? And does their complacency make them think that they shall still prevail","21:45":"Tell them, \"I warn you only because I have been divinely instructed to do so.\" And the deaf do not hear the call howsoever much they are warned","21:46":"And if punishment of your Lord were to touch them even slightly, they would certainly say, \"O woe to us! We did indeed commit wrong","21:47":"And We will set up just scales for the Day of Resurrection, so no wrong shall be done to anyone. And if there be anything as little in weight as that of a mustard seed, We will present it nevertheless. And We are sufficiently proficient in keeping accounts","21:48":"And certainly We did give Moses and Aaron the Criterion, a Light, and a Book often to refer to for guidance to those who would fear Allah and be pious","21:49":"Those that feared their Lord without seeing Him and were anxiously concerned about the Hour (marking the end of this world and heralding the Day of Judgment in the Hereafter)","21:50":"And would you then deny that this (Qur'aan) is the blessed Book, often to refer to for guidance, We have now revealed","21:51":"And certainly We did give Abraham, before (Moses and Aaron), his firmly right conduct.

I will certainly do something to your idols after you go away, turning your backs","21:58":"So he broke those (idols) into pieces, except for the biggest of them, that they (polytheists) may turn to it (to inform them as to who did the destruction of the other idols)","21:59":"They asked, \"Who has done this to our gods? The one who did this is certainly one of those most wicked","21:60":"Some said, \"We had heard a youth called Abraham speaking about them","21:61":"The others said, \"Then bring him before the eyes of the people. Let all witness","21:62":"The polytheists said, \"Have you done this to our gods, O Abraham","21:63":"Abraham said, \"Nay, it is this one — the chief of them — that has done it. So ask them, if they can speak coherently","21:64":"Then, turning to themselves, they said, \"You yourselves indeed are in the wrong","21:65":"And, their heads hanging down, they said to Abraham, \"You do know they do not speak","21:66":"Abraham said, \"Do you then worship, besides Allah, that which brings you no benefit at all, and no harm either","21:67":"Fie on you and on that which you worship besides Allah! Why do you not use your intellect","21:68":"They said, \"Put him in the fire and help your gods, if you are going to do anything","21:69":"WE ordered, \"O fire! Be you a source of cool comfort and peace on Abraham","21:70":"And they had designed a plot against him, but We made them themselves the doomed ones","21:71":"And We saved him and Lot and led them to the land in which We had placed Our blessings for all","21:72":"And We gave him Isaac — and, in addition, Jacob — and We made them righteous","21:73":"And We made them leaders who guided people by Our command. And We revealed to them how good deeds are done, how prayers are performed, and how charities are given. And Us certainly they obeyed","21:74":"And Lot — We gave him wisdom and knowledge.

They were indeed a wicked people, and so We drowned them all","21:78":"And David and Solomon — when they gave their judgments in the matter of the field wherein the sheep of some people pastured by night. And We bore witness to their judgments.h","21:79":"And We made Solomon to understand the problem better; but We gave wisdom and knowledge to each one of them. And We made the mountains, and the birds to sing Our praise with David (in the Psalms ). And We did all that","21:80":"And We taught him (David) how to make for you armours that fortify you in your battles. Are you then grateful","21:81":"And to Solomon We made subservient the stormy wind, which blew at his command to the land We had blessed. And We did know all things","21:82":"And of the devils there were those who dived for him and did other work besides. And We were guardians over them","21:83":"And Job — as he cried to his Lord, \"A calamity indeed it is that has afflicted me! And You are the most Merciful","21:84":"And We responded to him and removed whatever affliction he had. And We gave him his family, and as many more with them, out of mercy from Us and for Allah's worshippers to remember","21:85":"And Ishmael and Idris and Zulkifl — they were all of those who were patient","21:86":"And We admitted them to Our Mercy. They were indeed among the righteous people","21:87":"And the man of the fish — when he went away in anger, thinking We would not punish him! Then, among the darknesses (of the fish belly), he cried, \"There is no god but You, glorified You are! I have indeed been of those who do wrong","21:88":"Then We responded to him and delivered him from the grief.

If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then — to make things clear to you — We did indeed create you from dust, then from a little seed of fertilized ovum, then from a leech-like clinging clot of curdled blood, then from a chewed-like lump of flesh (foetus) with formed and unformed parts. And We facilitate what We will in the wombs till an appointed time, and then We bring you out as babies. Then We facilitate conditions for you to attain to your maturity. And of you is he who is made to die, and of you is he who is reduced to the worst part of life (very old age), so that he does not remember anything of the knowledge he had acquired earlier. And you see the earth barren, but when We send down the water on it, it stirs to life and flourishes and produces every kind of a beautiful spouse of herbage","22:6":"That (Resurrection) is bound to happen because Allah is the Truth and because He gives life to the dead and because He has power over all things","22:7":"And because the Hour is coming and there is no doubt about it; and because Allah shall raise up those who are in the graves","22:8":"And among mankind there is such a one as disputes about Allah without knowledge, without guidance and without an enlightening book.h","22:9":"Such a one turns his face away in pride from divine guidance that he may lead others astray from Allah's Path.

Allah does indeed do what He wills","22:15":"If anyone thinks that Allah does not help him in this life and the Hereafter, let him reach out to the heavens by means available to him, then (study its functions meticulously by) cutting himself off (his earthly connection), and then see if his obstinacy gets rid of its severity","22:16":"And thus have We revealed it (the Qur'aan) with Verses made clear.

And it is they who shall be the losers in the Hereafter","27:6":"And, indeed, you (singular) are made to receive this Qur'aan from One who is Wise, Knowledgeable","27:7":"When Moses said to his family, \"I do indeed see a fire. I shall bring you from there some information, or bring you a burning brand so that you warm yourselves therewith","27:8":"Then, when he came to it, he was called out and told, \"Blessed is all that is in the fire and around it! And glory to Allah, Lord of the worlds","27:9":"O Moses! It is indeed Me, Allah — the Almighty, the Wise","27:10":"And throw your staff down!\" Then he saw it (staff) stir as if it were a serpent. And he took to flight and did not look back! \"O Moses! Fear not. The Messengers need have no fear in My Presence","27:11":"Nor those need fear who do wrong and then after a bad deed they change for the good. for, indeed, I am Forgiving, Merciful","27:12":"And put your hand into your pocket: it will come out blemish-less white — [these are] among nine signs unto Pharaoh and his people. They are indeed a depraved people","27:13":"So then when Our clear-cut signs came unto them (Pharaoh and his people), they said, \"This is pure magic","27:14":"And, though their minds were convinced of their genuineness, they wickedly and arrogantly refused to accept those as signs. And behold what happened in the end to those corrupt people","27:15":"And We did grant knowledge to David and Solomon. And they both said, \"Praise to Allah! HE has favoured us above many of His believing devotees","27:16":"And Solomon inherited David. And he said, \"O people! We have been taught the speech of the birds, and have been given all kinds of things. This, indeed, is certainly a manifest favour","27:17":"And Solomon's armies — of Jinns&, of human beings, and of birds — were assembled and then they were led forth in orderly ranks before him","27:18":"The parade went on till, when they came upon a valley of ants, an ant said, \"O ants! Get into your homes (holes), lest Solomon and his armies crush you unknowingly","27:19":"Solomon then smiled broadly at her (the ant's) words, and said, \"My Lord! Make me grateful for your favours which You have bestowed on me and on my parents. And make me do righteous deeds which You are pleased with. And put me in the list of Your righteous devotees","27:20":"And he (Solomon) inspected the rank of the birds, and said, \"How come I do not see the Hudhud ? Or is he among the absentees","27:21":"I will punish it severely or slaughter it unless it brings me a convincing excuse","27:22":"And when the bird registered its presence before long, it said, \"I have covered something which you have not. And I have come to you from Sheba with reliable information","27:23":"I did indeed find there a woman ruling over them. And she is endowed with everything. And she has a huge throne","27:24":"And I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of to Allah! And the Satan has made their deeds look good to them, and has thus hindered them from the Right Path. And so they do not tread that Path","27:25":"And the Satan prompts them not to bow to Allah Who it is that takes out the hidden, in the heavens and on earth, and knows what you conceal and what you declare","27:26":"Allah! No god besides Him — Lord of the Mighty Throne","27:27":"Solomon said to the bird, \"We shall soon see whether thou have told the truth or are one of those who lie","27:28":"Go with this letter of mine and drop it to them! Then withdraw from them and observe how they react","27:29":"The Queen of Sheba said: \"O noblemen! A significant letter has been dropped down to me","27:30":"It is indeed from Solomon, and it indeed tells me, in the name of Allah, the Gracious, the Merciful","27:31":"Exalt not anything (or anybody) above Me, and come to Me in willing surrender","27:32":"She said, \"O noblemen! Give me your advice on what I should do. I would never pass an order unless you endorse it","27:33":"They said, \"We are a powerful nation, capable of fighting bravely in war. And the command is yours. Consider, then, what command you would give","27:34":"She said, \"Indeed, when kings invade a place of human habitation they devastate it, and humiliate its respected inhabitants. And this is how they behave","27:35":"And so, indeed, I am going to send a gift to them, and see what the envoys bring back","27:36":"Then, when the Queen's envoy came to Solomon, the latter said, \"Are you helping me with wealth? But what Allah has given me is better than what He has given you! Nay, it is you yourself that would rejoice in your gift","27:37":"Go back to them! We shall certainly come to them with forces they will not be able to face! And we shall certainly cause them to be driven therefrom, humiliated and belittled","27:38":"Solomon said, \"O noblemen! Which of you can bring me her throne before they surrender and come to me","27:39":"A gigantic and powerful one of the Jinns said, \"I shall bring it to you before you rise from your seat. And, indeed, I have dependable ability to do it","27:40":"The one who had knowledge acquired from the divine Record, said, \"I shall bring it (Queen of Sheba's throne) to you before the twinkling of your eyes!\" And when he saw it (the throne) squarely placed before him, Solomon exclaimed, \"This is by the Grace of my Lord! It is to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. And he who is grateful is but grateful for his own sake. And as for he who is ungrateful, my Lord is indeed self-sufficient, beneficent","27:41":"Solomon said, \"Disguise her throne for her. Let us see if she recognizes it or not","27:42":"And when she arrived, she was asked, \"Is this throne like yours?\" She said, \"It is almost the same!\" [Solomon said to himself or to his noblemen,] \"And the knowledge had come to us before her, and we had surrendered ourselves to Allah","27:43":"And what she worshipped besides Allah had kept her away from the right path. She is descended, indeed, of people who suppressed the Truth","27:44":"She was asked to enter the royal court. And when she saw it, she thought it was a pool of water and bared her legs. Solomon said, \"It is but a court paved with glass!\" She said, \"My Lord! I have indeed committed a wrong against myself. And I have surrendered myself, with Solomon, unto the Lord of all the worlds","27:45":"And We did send to the ancient tribe of Thamood their brother Salih to advise them, \"Worship Allah!\" And they then split into two contending factions","27:46":"Salih said, \"O my people! Why do you hasten for the evil to come upon you before the good? Why do you not ask for forgiveness from Allah, so that you might be treated with mercy","27:47":"They said, \"We take you and those with you as portents of evil!\" Salih said, \"Your portents rest with Allah. Nay, you are a people on trial","27:48":"And there were in the city nine of a leading family. They caused corruption to spread on earth, and they would not reform","27:49":"They said, \"Swear to one another by Allah that we shall surely attack him and his family by night. And then we shall say to his next of kin, `We were not witness to the destruction of his family, and we are of course telling the truth","27:50":"And they devised a plan, and We devised a plan. And they knew not","27:51":"Then see what all their planning came to in the end: We annihilated them and their people — all of them","27:52":"And these their houses overturned, because of the wrong they did. There is, indeed, a lesson in this for people who know","27:53":"And We saved those who believed and refrained from wrong-doing fearing Allah's wrath","27:54":"And Lot — as he asked his people, \"How could you so openly indulge in the obscenity","27:55":"How could you really go to men instead of to women for sexual gratification? Nay, but you are a stupid people","27:56":"His people's answer was not but that, \"Expel Lot's family out of your township! They are indeed folk too pure to live with","27:57":"We then saved him and his family, except for his wife whom We willed to be among those that stayed behind","27:58":"And We rained a rain upon them. Dire was the rain upon those warned","27:59":"Say, \"The praise is for Allah, and peace on those devotees of His whom He chose!\" Is Allah better or those they worship besides Him","27:60":"Is there any god worthy of worship besides Allah — Allah Who it is that has created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water from the skies, and then therewith We cause — it is not in your power to make those trees grow — beautiful gardens to grow? But yet they are a people who equate others with Allah","27:61":"Is there any god worthy of worship besides Allah — Allah Who it is that has made the earth stable, and has caused rivers to flow in its ravines, and has set mountains upon it, and has placed a barrier between the two seas ? Nay, most of them know not","27:62":"Is there any god worthy of worship besides Allah — Allah Who it is that responds to the one in distress when that one calls out (prays) to Him and Who removes the distress, and Who has made you His vicegerents on the earth? Seldom do you remember this","27:63":"Is there any god worthy of worship besides Allah — Allah Who it is that guides you in the midst of the darkness of land and sea, and sends the winds heralding the approach of His mercy (rains)? Exalted is Allah far above what they worship besides Him","27:64":"Is there any god worthy of worship besides Allah — Allah Who it is that initiates creation in the first instance — and then recreates it — and provides you with means of sustenance from the heavens and the earth? Say, \"Produce your evidence — if what you claim is true","27:65":"Say, \"None in the heavens or on earth knows the Unseen save Allah!\" And they know not when they shall be raised from the dead","27:66":"Nay, their knowledge fails them in regard to the Hereafter! Nay, they are in doubt about it. Nay, they are blind to it","27:67":"And those that suppress the truth say, \"Shall we and our forefathers be truly brought back to life after we have become dust","27:68":"Verily, we were promised this — we and our forefathers — in the past as well; it is nothing but fables of ancient times","27:69":"Say, \"Travel the earth and see what end the sinners met with","27:70":"And grieve not over them, and be not in misery because of what they conspire","27:71":"And they ask, \"When — if you are men of truth — is this promise to be fulfilled","27:72":"Say, \"It may well be that something of what you want hastened has already come close to you","27:73":"And, indeed, your Lord does certainly bestow lots of favours upon mankind, but most of them are ungrateful","27:74":"And, indeed, your Lord does certainly know what their minds conceal and what they reveal","27:75":"And there is nothing hidden in the heavens or on earth, but duly and clearly mentioned in the divine Record","27:76":"This Qur'an does indeed explain to the Children of Israel most of what they differ in","27:77":"And, indeed, it certainly is guidance and mercy for all the believers","27:78":"Indeed, your Lord will judge between them by His Decree. And He is the One Omnipotent, All-knowing","27:79":"Put your trust then in Allah. You are indeed on the Truth manifest","27:80":"You cannot make the dead hear. And you cannot make the deaf to the call hear when they turn their backs and go away","27:81":"And you cannot guide the blind out of their liability. None can you make listen to you save those who believe in Our Verses/signs and then become Muslims (surrender to Allah's Will)","27:82":"And when the word gets fulfilled about them, We shall bring out for them a creature from the earth, which will tell them that mankind had no real faith in Our Verses/signs. @ @ My undedrstanding of this Verse is that it applies to modern man's unabashed gobbling up of the theory of evolution. Protagonists of this theory assert that mankind evolved itself from lower forms of life through processes of natural selection and survival of the fittest. They reject the Qur'aanic assertion that a Super-intelligent, Omniscient and Omnipresent Being has consciously, deliberately or purposefully created mankind and everything else in the Universe. The thought of such a Creator is anathema for the atheists subscribing to the theory of evolution. This theory could well be the creature spoken of in this Verse, telling those who believe in it that they have no real faith in the Qur'aanic Verses/signs. In this context I invite my readers to go through my booklet Why Do I Believe In Islam","27:83":"And on that Day We shall gather from within every community a host of those who considered Our Verses false. They will then be led in rows","27:84":"And so when they shall come up before Allah, He will say, \"You considered My Verses false and you have had no thorough knowledge thereon!? What were you doing","27:85":"And the Word shall get fulfilled about them because of the wrong they had committed, and they will not speak","27:86":"Do they not see that it is We who had made the night for them to rest therein, and the day to make them see well? In this, indeed, there certainly are signs for people who believe","27:87":"And the Day the trumpet is sounded, everyone in the heavens and on earth will be seized with fear, except such as Allah wills. And everyone will come to Him humbly","27:88":"And you will see the mountains — which you consider firm — floating about like clouds. A creation of Allah, Who has ordered all things to perfection! He is indeed aware of all that you do","27:89":"Whoever comes with good shall get a reward better even than what he/she deserves. And they will be secure from the terror of that Day","27:90":"And those who come with evil, they will be cast upon their faces into the Fire. They will be asked, \"Are you not but justly requitted for what you were doing","27:91":"I have been commanded to worship the Lord of this City — the Lord who has made the city sacred, and to whom all things belong. And I have been commanded to be of those who surrender themselves to Him","27:92":"And that I recite the Qur'aan.\" One then that follows the right path, follows it for one's own good. And to one that goes astray, say, \"I am but of those who warn","27:93":"And say, \"The praise is for Allah! He will soon show you His signs, and then you shall recognise them.\" And your Lord is not unaware of what you do","28:1":"Ta. Sin. Mim","28:2":"These are Verses of the Book that gives clear guidance","28:3":"We narrate to you from the story of Moses and Pharaoh with truth, for people who believe","28:4":"Indeed, Pharaoh had acquired great power on earth and had divided its people into sects. He persecuted a group among them, killing their sons and sparing their women. He was indeed of those who perpetrated injustice","28:5":"And We desired to favour the downtrodden on earth, and make them leaders and make them the inheritors","28:6":"And to make them strong and stable on earth, and to show Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts the very thing they feared from them (destruction of Pharaoh and his people)","28:7":"And We sent a secret communication to the mother of Moses, \"Suckle him! And, when you fear for him, then put him into the river and fear not nor grieve. We shall indeed bring him back to you and shall make him one of Our Messengers","28:8":"And the family of Pharaoh picked him up to become for them a source of enmity and sorrow. Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts did indeed err","28:9":"And the wife of Pharaoh said, \"He will be — for me and for you — a solace of our eyes. Kill him not! He may be of use to us, or we may adopt him as a son.\" And they knew not","28:10":"And Moses' mother became agitated in her heart! And she would have betrayed him had We not calmed her heart down so as for her to be of those who believe","28:11":"And she said to his sister, \"Follow his (infant Moses') track.\" So she kept a watch on him from a distance, and they knew it not","28:12":"And We had forbidden foster-mothers for him beforehand. So she (Moses' sister) said, \"May I show you a household that will rear him for you and take good care of him","28:13":"And then We restored him to his mother that she might be comforted and not grieved and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of them know not","28:14":"And when he reached adulthood and maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. And thus do We reward the good","28:15":"And he entered the city at a time when its people were in a state of slumber, and he found therein two men fighting, one of his own sect, and the other of his enemies. And he who was of his sect asked him for help against him who was of his enemies. Moses then struck him with his fist and caused his death. He said, \"This is a work of the devil. He is an enemy, an open misleader","28:16":"Moses said, \"My Lord! I have indeed wronged my own self, so forgive me. HE then forgave him. HE is indeed the One forgiving, merciful","28:17":"He said, \"My Lord! Inasmuch as You have favoured me, I shall never again be a supporter of the guilty","28:18":"Then, next morning, as he was looking about apprehensively in the city, the same man who had sought Moses' help the day before was again crying out to him for help. Moses said to him, \"You are certainly indeed a clear instigator","28:19":"And when he (Moses) intended to attack the man who was an enemy to them both, that man said, \"O Moses! Would you kill me as you did kill a person yesterday? You intend nothing but to be a tyrant in the land. And you intend not to be a reformer","28:20":"And a man came running from the city suburbs. He said, \"O Moses! The chiefs are conferring against you to kill you. So, get away! I am indeed a well-wisher to you","28:21":"So he went away from there, fearful and wary. He said, \"My Lord! Save me from the wicked people","28:22":"And when he turned toward Midian, he said, \"My Lord may guide me in the right direction","28:23":"And when he arrived at the watering place of Midian he found there a lot of men watering their animals. And he found two women, apart from the men, holding their flocks back. He asked, \"What is the matter with you two?\" The two said, \"We cannot water our flocks till the shepherds lead theirs' away from the water. And our father is a very old man","28:24":"So he (Moses) watered their flock for them. Then he turned for rest under the shade and said, \"My Lord! I am in dire need of whatever good You send down to me","28:25":"Then one of the two women came walking bashfully to him and said, \"My father is inviting you so that he may repay you for watering our animals for us.\" Then, when Moses came to the old man and recounted his story to him, the latter said, \"Fear not! You are now safe from the wicked people","28:26":"One of the two women said, \"O my father! Hire him. It is indeed better to hire the strong, the trustworthy","28:27":"He said, \"I would like to give one of these two daughters of mine in marriage to you on condition that you work for me for eight years. And then you may voluntarily extend your service to ten years; for, I would not make it hard for you. You shall find me of the righteous, Allah willing","28:28":"Moses said, \"That is between you and me. Whichever of the two terms I fulfil, there shall be no compulsion on me to serve more. And Allah is Guarantor over what we say","28:29":"Then, when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his family, he visualised a fire in the direction of the mountain and said to his family, \"Wait here! It does indeed appear to me that there is a fire there. Perhaps I can bring you some information from there or a brand from the fire that you may warm yourselves","28:30":"Then when he arrived there, he was addressed by a voice from the right ridge of the valley in the blessed spot among the woods, \"O Moses! I am indeed Allah, the Lord of the Worlds","28:31":"Throw your staff down!\" Then he saw it (staff) stir as if it were a serpent. And he took to flight and did not look back! \"O Moses! Come back and fear not. You are indeed of those who are secure","28:32":"Insert your hand into your pocket: it will come out blemish-less white, and steel yourself against fear. These are two evidential signs from your Lord for Pharaoh and his chieftains. They are indeed a depraved people","28:33":"Moses said, \"My Lord! I had killed one of their men and I fear that they will kill me","28:34":"My brother Aaron can speak more clearly than me. Send him then with me as a suport to confirm what I would tell them. I am afraid they will disbelieve me","28:35":"Allah said, \"We will strengthen your arm with your brother's. And We will create for you both a shield so that they cannot reach out to you. With Our signs, you two, and those who follow you, will be the winners","28:36":"Then as Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said, \"This is nothing but concocted magic. We had not heard of such a thing from our forefathers","28:37":"And Moses said, \"My Lord knows as to who brings guidance from Him, and for whom will be the heavenly abode in the Hereafter. Indeed! The wicked shall not succeed","28:38":"And Pharaoh said, \"O chieftains! I know of no god for you other than me. O Haman! Bake the mud for me and then set up for me a lofty tower in order that I may go up to Whom Moses worships. And, indeed, I think he is a liar","28:39":"And he (Pharaoh) and his hosts had, without right, been haughty on the earth, and had thought that they would never be brought back to Us","28:40":"So We seized him and his hosts, and abandoned them in the sea. Just see what end the wicked people met with","28:41":"And We placed them as leaders inviting people to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped","28:42":"And We made a curse to follow them in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among those loathed","28:43":"And We did give the Scripture to Moses after what We had destroyed of the older generations — clear insights for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy, that they might reflect","28:44":"And you (Muhammad) were not there on the West Side when We decreed the Commandment upon Moses, and you were not among those present then","28:45":"But (between Moses' time and yours, O Muhammad!) We grew many generations, and the age prolonged over them. And you were not a dweller among the people of Midian reciting to them Our Verses, but We kept on sending other Messengers to those generations","28:46":"And you were not by the side of the Mount when We made the call. But you are now given this piece of knowledge from the Unseen as a mercy from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you. They may perhaps take heed","28:47":"Lest, if disaster should afflict them because of what their own hands have sent before them, they might say, \"Our Lord! Why have you not sent a Messenger to us, that we might have followed your Verses and been of the believers","28:48":"Then as the Truth came to them from Us, they said, \"Why is he not given the like of what was given to Moses?\" Did they not suppress the Truth in what was given to Moses before? They said, \"Those are two delusions that back each other up.\" And they said, \"We do ineed disbelieve both","28:49":"Say, \"Then bring a scripture from Allah that would give guidance clearer than these two. I shall follow it, if what you say is true","28:50":"And if they answer you not, then know that what they follow is their lusts. And who could go farther astray than he who follows his lust with no guidance from Allah? Indeed! Allah guides not the wicked people","28:51":"And verily We have caused the Word to contact them, that they may take heed","28:52":"Those whom We had given the Scripture before it (the Qur'aan), they too come to believe in it","28:53":"And when it is recited to them, they say, \"We believe in it. It is indeed the Truth from our Lord. We were of those who surrender to Allah even before it (the Qur'aan) was revealed","28:54":"These will be given their reward doubled, because they are patient and repel evil with good, and spend from what We have provided them","28:55":"And when they hear vain talk they withdraw from it and say, \"To us our deeds and to you yours. Peace to you! We do not wish to behave like ignorant people","28:56":"You (O Muhammad) guide not whom you love, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He knows who the rightly guided are.h","28:57":"And they say, \"If we were to follow the Guidance with you we should be exterminated from our land.\" Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary, produce of all kinds being brought to it as a provision from Us? But most of them know not","28:58":"And how many a civilisation We did destroy that was boastful of its means! And there are their dwellings, which have been but little inhabited after them. And We, We were the inheritors","28:59":"And never did your Lord destroy the civilisations, till He had raised up in the birth-place of that civilisation a Messenger reciting to them Our Verses. And never did We destroy the civilisation unless the people thereof did evil things","28:60":"And anything that is given to you is for the life of this world and its charm. And that which is with Allah is better and lasting. Why do you not understand","28:61":"Is he whom We have given a good promise, which he will find fulfilled, like him whom We have given the comfort of the life of this world, then on the Day of Resurrection he will be of those brought to justice","28:62":"And on the day when He will summon them and ask, \"Where are My partners whom you imagined did exist","28:63":"Those concerning whom the Word shall have come true will say, \"Our Lord! These are they whom we led astray. We led them astray because we ourselves were astray. We declare our dissociation from them to You! They did not worship us","28:64":"And they will be told, \"Call those whom you worshipped besides Allah.\" And they will call them, but they will give no answer to them! And they will see the punishment before them. Ah, had they but been guided","28:65":"And on the Day when He will summon them and ask, \"What was your response to the Messengers","28:66":"Then, that Day, they will be blind to all that the Messengers had told them. Nor will they question one another about it","28:67":"Then he who repents and believes and does right deeds — he may be among the successful ones","28:68":"And your Lord creates what He wills; and He chooses that which is good for them. Glorified is Allah and Exalted above all that they worship besides Him","28:69":"And your Lord knows what they conceal in their minds, and what they reveal","28:70":"And He is Allah; there is none to worship other than Him. His is the praise in this, and in the other world. And His is the Command, and to Him you all will be brought back","28:71":"Say, \"Do you realize: had Allah made the night continue over you without any light till the Day of Resurrection, which god other than Allah could bring you light? Will you not then listen","28:72":"Say, \"Do you realize: had Allah made the daylight continue over you till the Day of Resurrection, which god other than Allah could bring you night to rest therein? Will you not then see","28:73":"And by His mercy He has made for you the night wherein to rest and the day to seek some of His provisions, and to be thankful","28:74":"And on the Day when He will summon them and ask, \"Where are My partners whom you imagined did exist","28:75":"And We shall take out from every community a witness and then say, \"Produce your proof.\" They will then know that the Truth is for Allah, and all that they invented will have abandoned them","28:76":"Korah [Qaroon] was indeed of Moses' people, but then he behaved arrogantly with them. And We had given him so much of treasure that the keys thereof would certainly have been a burden for a company of strong men. His people once told him, \"Exult not! Allah does indeed not love the exultant","28:77":"And seek the abode of the Hereafter in what Allah has given you and forget not what you have got of this world. And be you kind even as Allah has been kind to you, and seek not the spread of corruption in the earth. Allah does not indeed love those who indulge in corruption","28:78":"Korah said, \"I have been given it only becuse of my knowledge.\" Did he not know of the generations, before him, that Allah had already destroyed, who were mightier than him in strength and greater in manpower? The sinners are not questioned about their sins (before they are destroyed here in this world)","28:79":"And so he went out before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of the life of this world said, \"Ah! Would that we had the like of what Korah has been given. He does indeed possess an exceptionally great fortune","28:80":"But those who had been given knowledge said, \"Woe to you! Allah's reward is better for him who believes and does good deeds. And none but those who are patient shall get it","28:81":"Then We sank the earth with him and his house. Then he had no force to help him against Allah, nor was he of those who are helped","28:82":"And those who had coveted his (Korah's) place but yesterday exclaimed the morning after (Korah's sinking), \"Ah, well! Allah gives the provision for living in ample measure to whom He wills of His slaves and restricts it to whom He wills. Had Allah not been gracious to us, He would have sunk the earth with us. Ah, well! Those who suppress the Truth shall not attain salvation","28:83":"We have prepared this Home of the Hereafter for those who desire not an exalted position — nor corruption — on the earth. And the good end is for those who are Allah-fearing and pious","28:84":"He who comes with a good deed, he will have a reward better than what his deed deserved. And he who comes with an evil deed — those who do ill-deeds will be repaid with only what their deeds deserved","28:85":"Indeed! He Who has made the Qur'aan obligatory on you will surely bring you (Muhammad) back home. Say, \"My Lord knows who brings guidance and who is in delusion manifest","28:86":"And you did not expect the Book to be thrown at you, but as a mercy from your Lord. So lend no support to the suppressors of the Truth","28:87":"And let them not hinder you from Allah's Verses after those have been sent down to you. And call them to your Lord, and be not of the polytheists","28:88":"And pray not to any other god besides Allah. There is no god but Him. Everything will perish save His Countenance/Self. His is the Command, and to Him you will all be brought back","29:1":"These are some of the letters of the Arabic language that appear at the beginning of some Qur'aanic chapters.

We do exact retribution from the offenders","32:23":"And We did indeed give Moses the Book — doubt not then the meeting with Him — and We made it a guide for the Children of Israel","32:24":"And We made, from among them, leaders to guide them with patience by Our command. And they were certain in their belief of Our Verses/signs","32:25":"Your Lord it is, indeed, Who will judge amongst them, on the Day of Resurrection, on matters they differed in","32:26":"How many a generation — in whose erstwhile dwelling places they now move about — have We destroyed before them? Does not this fact give guidance to them? Indeed there are signs in this. Do they not then hear (about those generations)","32:27":"Do they not see that We drive the water to the barren land, then bring out thereby an agricultural produce of which their cattle and they themselves eat? Do they not then understand what they see","32:28":"And they say, \"When will this Inauguration (of the Hereafter) come, if what you say is true","32:29":"Say, \"On the Day of the Inauguration, belief of those who (now) disbelieve will not profit them, nor will they be given any respite","32:30":"So leave them alone and wait! They too are indeed waiting","33:1":"O Prophet! Fear Allah and obey not the disbelievers (suppressors of the Truth) and the hypocrites. Allah is indeed Knowledgeable, Wise","33:2":"And follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. Allah is indeed ever Aware of what you (all people) do","33:3":"And have trust in Allah! And Allah is sufficient as dispenser of affairs","33:4":"Allah has not made for any man two hearts within him. And He has not made your wives, whom you desert by Zihar (i.e. by uttering that your wives' backs are like your mothers' backs), your mothers. And He has not made your adopted sons your sons. These are just words uttered by your mouths. And Allah tells the truth and it is He Who shows the way","33:5":"Call them by names linking them to their fathers; this is the equitable thing to do by Allah's standards. And if you know not their fathers, then they are your brethren in faith and your wards. And there is no blame on you in that you make a mistake therein without any bad intention. And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful","33:6":"The Prophet is closer to the believers than they are to themselves. And his wives are their mothers. And the womb (blood) relations are closer one to another, in Allah's Writ, than to the other believers and the migrants, except for what good you do to your bosom friends. This is as recorded in the Book","33:7":"And when We took a covenant from the prophets and from you (O Muhammad) — and from Noah, Abraham, Moses and Jesus son of Mary — We took from them a solemn covenant","33:8":"(The covenant taken was for the purpose) that He (Allah) may question the truthful of their truth, and He has prepared for the suppressors of the Truth a painful punishment","33:9":"O you who believe! Remember Allah's favour to you when there came against you armies against whom We sent a strong wind and armies that you saw not. And Allah does ever see what you do","33:10":"When they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when the eyes swooned and the hearts rose up to the throats, and you began to have misgivings about Allah","33:11":"There the believers were put on trial and shaken with a severe shaking","33:12":"And when the hypocrites and people with sick minds said, \"Allah and His Messenger have promised us nothing but delusions","33:13":"And when a section of them said, \"O people of Yathrib! You cannot make a stand, so go back. And a group of them sought permission of the Prophet, saying, \"Our houses are exposed.\" And their houses were not exposed; they just wanted to run away","33:14":"And had an entry been made upon them from behind, and then they (hypocites) were asked to defect, they would certainly have done it with little hesitation","33:15":"And they did make a pledge with Allah before, that they would not turn their backs. And a pledge with Allah is bound to be questioned about","33:16":"Say, \"Fleeing will profit you not, if you flee from death, natural or violent. And even then, (when, with Allah's will, you are given respite from death for the time being,) you will not be allowed to enjoy life on this earth but a little","33:17":"Say, \"Who is it that can shield you from Allah, if He intends to harm you or He intends to show you mercy?\" And they will find none as a wali to them or to help them besides Allah","33:18":"Allah does know those among you who hinder others and those who say to their brethren, \"Come to us!\" And they hardly come to fight in a battle","33:19":"They grudge any help to you. But when fear grips them, you will see them look at you with eyes rolling, as if death has overtaken them. But when fear is gone, they lash you with sharp tongues grudging over wealth. These people are not believers, so Allah has rendered their deeds null and void. And that is easy for Allah","33:20":"They (hypocrites) think the confederates are not gone. And should the confederates come again, they would like to be in the deserts with the Bedouins asking for news about you. And were they to be with you, they would hardly fight","33:21":"Certainly you have in the Messenger of Allah an excellent example for anyone who turns to Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah much","33:22":"And when the believers saw the Confederates, they said, \"This is what Allah and His Messenger promised us, and Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. And it increased in them nothing but faith and submission","33:23":"Of the believers there are men who are true to the promise they made to Allah. And of them is he who has fulfilled his vow, and of them is he who is waiting (to fulfill it). And they have not changed in the least","33:24":"(Mankind is variously tested in this world) so that Allah may reward the truthful for their truth, and punish the hypocrites if He so pleases, or pardon them. Allah is indeed ever Forgiving, Merciful","33:25":"And Allah repelled the disbelievers consumed in their rage; they gained no advantage (in their armed invasion against Medina). And Allah sufficed the believers in the war. And Allah is Strong, Omnipotent","33:26":"And He sent down those of the People of the Book who backed them (the Confedrates) from their fortresses and He cast terror into their minds; some you killed and some you took captive","33:27":"And He made you heirs to their land and their dwellings and their property, and to lands on which you have not yet set foot. And Allah has power over all things","33:28":"O Prophet, tell you wives, \"If you desire the life of this world and its glitter, well then, I will make an adequate provision for you and give you a gracious release","33:29":"And if you desire Allah and His Messenger and the abode of the Hereafter, then Allah has indeed prepared a great reward for the virtuous ones among you","33:30":"O wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you is guilty of manifestly improper conduct, double is the punishment for her. And this is easy for Allah","33:31":"And whoever of you (Prophet's wives) is devoted to Allah and His Messenger and performs good deeds, We shall reward her twice, and We have prepared for her a generous provision","33:32":"O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other woman. If you fear Allah, be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease be moved by desire. And speak in a normal, appropriate, matter-of-fact manner","33:33":"And stay at home and display not the display of the ignorance of yore. And establish prayer, give charity, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah only desires to rid you of anything bad and unclean, O people of the (Prophet's) household, and to cleanse you thoroughly","33:34":"And remember what is recited in your houses of the Verses of Allah and the Wisdom. Allah is indeed ever Meticulous, Aware","33:35":"Indeed, the men who submit and the women who submit, and the men who believe and the women who believe, and the men devoted to Allah and the women devoted to Allah, and the truthful men and the truthful women, and the men exercising patience and the women exercising patience, and the humble men and the humble women, and the men who give sadaqah and the women who give sadaqah, and the men who fast and the women who fast, and the men who guard their chastity and the women who guard, and the men who remember Allah much and the women who remember — Allah is prepared to forgive them and grant them a great reward","33:36":"And it behoves not a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah — and His Messenger — has decided an affair, to exercise a choice in their matter. And whoever revolts against Allah and His Messenger, he surely and clearly goes astray","33:37":"And when you said to him whom Allah and you had shown favour to, \"Keep your wife to yourself and fear Allah!\" And you concealed in your heart what Allah would bring to light. And you feared men, and Allah has a greater right that you should fear Him! So when Zaid completed necessary divorce formalities from her (Zaid's wife), We gave her in marriage to you, so that there should be no difficulty for the believers about the wives of their adopted sons, when they (adopted sons) have completed necessary divorce formalities from them (their wives). And Allah's decree does ever get implemented","33:38":"There can be nothing forbidden for the Prophet in what Allah has ordained for him. Such has been the way of Allah with those who have gone before. And Allah's decree is a thing destined","33:39":"[And such shall be the way of Allah with] those who convey Messages of Allah and fear Him, and fear none but Allah. And Allah is Sufficient to keep accounts","33:40":"Muhammad is not father to any of you men, but he is Messenger of Allah and Seal of the Prophets. And Allah does know all things","33:41":"O you who believe! Remember Allah much and often","33:42":"And glorify Him morning and evening","33:43":"He it is Who blesses you — and so do His angels — that He may bring you out of darkness into light. And He is ever Merciful to the believers","33:44":"Their salutation on the day they meet Him will be, \"Peace!\" And He has prepared for them a noble reward","33:45":"O Prophet! We have indeed sent you as a witness, and to convey good news (to the people) and to warn (them)","33:46":"And as one who invites people to Allah with His permission, and as a lighted lamp","33:47":"And give the believers the good news that they shall have a great favour from Allah","33:48":"And obey not those who suppress the Truth and obey not the hypocrites, and tolerate the annoyance they cause you, and trust Allah. And Allah is sufficient as dispenser of affairs","33:49":"O you who believe! When you marry believing women and then divorce them before you touch them, you have in their case no waiting period which you should observe. However make a good provision for them and set them free in a fair manner","33:50":"O Prophet! We have made lawful to you your wives whom you have given their dowries, and those whom your right hand possesses out of those whom Allah has given you as prisoners of war, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who migrated with you; and a believing woman, if she gives herself to the Prophet, if the Prophet desires to marry her. This is a special provision for you only, not for the (other) believers. We do know what We have ordained for them concerning their wives and concerning those whom their right hands possess. We give this clarification in order that no blame may lie on you. Andh Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful","33:51":"You (Prophet) may defer the turn of any you please of them (Prophet's wives), and take to you any you please. And you may wish for any of those you had put off — no blame on you. They are thus more likely to calm down and not grieve, and be pleased, all of them, with what you give them. And Allah knows what is in your minds. And Allah is Knowledgeable, Kind","33:52":"No more wives are allowed to you after this. Nor are you allowed to exchange them (existing wives) for other wives, though the latters' beauty be pleasing to you, except those whom your right hand possesses (slaves). And Allah is Watchful over everything","33:53":"O you who believe! Enter not the houses of the Prophet unless invited there for a meal, but then go not there too early as to wait for the meal to be ready. But enter at the time you are invited, and as soon as you have finished your meals, disperse! And linger not for a customary talk. This does indeed cause inconvenience to the Prophet, but he is too embarrassed to tell you. And Allah is not embarrassed to express the truth. And when you ask for anything from them (ladies of the Prophet's household), ask of them from behind a curtain. This would be better for the purity of your hearts and of theirs. And it behoves you not to cause inconvnience to the Messenger of Allah, nor to marry his wives after him. This is indeed a matter of great significance with Allah","33:54":"Whether you do a thing openly or do it in secrecy, Allah does in any case know everything","33:55":"No blame on them (ladies of Prophet's household) in respect of their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their own women, or of what their right hands possess (slaves).And O ladies! Fear Allah and obey Him. Allah is indeed Witness over all things","33:56":"Indeed, Allah and His angels bless the Prophet. O you who believe! Bless him and greet him nicely","33:57":"Allah has cursed those who do indeed displease Allah and His Messenger — cursed them in this world and the Hereafter. And He has prepared for them a disgracful punishment","33:58":"And those who harm believing men and believing women unjustly, they become guilty of slander and manifest sin","33:59":"O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of believers to put on their outer-garments over their bodies in such a way that they are recognised and not molested.h And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","33:60":"If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease and those who spread rumours and trouble in Madinah desist not, We shall certainly urge you on against them. And then they shall not be your neighbours therein but for a little while","33:61":"Accursed, they will be seized and slain wherever found","33:62":"That was the way Allah dealt with those who have gone before. And you will find no change in Allah's way","33:63":"People ask you about the Hour (the time when the present world will end and the Hereafter begin). Say, \"Information about it is only with Allah. And what do you know, the Hour may be nigh","33:64":"Allah has indeed cursed the suppressors of Truth and prepared for them a burning Fire","33:65":"They will abide therein forever. They will find neither a wali nor anyone to help","33:66":"That day when their faces are turned about in the Fire, they will say, \"Woe to us! Would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger","33:67":"And they will say, \"Our Lord! We only obeyed our bosses and our seniors. And they led us astray from the right path","33:68":"Our Lord! Give them a double punishment and give them a severe curse","33:69":"O you who believe! Be not like those who offended Moses, but Allah cleared him of what they said. And he had an honourable standing with Allah","33:70":"O you who believe! Fear Allah and speak in appropriate and straight (unambiguous and to the point) words","33:71":"He (Allah) will improve your deeds for you, and forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, he/she does certainly achieve a great success","33:72":"We did indeed offer the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they were unwilling to bear its burden and were apprehensive of it. And man bore that burden! He has indeed been unjust and ignorant","33:73":"That Allah may punish the hypocrites, men and women, and the polytheists, men and women. And Allah will turn mercifully to the believing men and the believing women. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","34:1":"Praise to Allah! To Him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. And to Him belongs praise in the Hereafter! And He is the One wise, aware","34:2":"He knows what goes down into the earth and what comes out of it, and what comes down from the heavens and what goes up there. And He is the Merciful, the Forgiving","34:3":"And those who suppress the Truth say, \"The Hour (the time when the present world will end and the Hereafter begin) is not going to come to us ever.\" Say, \"Yes, by my Lord, the Knower of the unseen! It is certainly going to come to you.\" No mass (weight) particle is hidden from Him, either in the heavens or in the earth. And nor is there anything less than that nor greater, but clearly recorded","34:4":"(The Hour is indeed going to come) in order that He (Allah) may reward those who believe and do good deeds. For them there is forgiveness and a noble provision","34:5":"And for those who strive hard to defeat the purpose of Our Messages, there is punishment of a painful scourge","34:6":"And those who have been given knowledge see that what is revealed to you from your Lord is the Truth, and that it guides towards the path of the Omnipotent, the Praised One","34:7":"And those who suppress the Truth say, \"Shall we show you a man who informs you that, when you are completely shred into tiny pieces, you will even then be created anew","34:8":"Has he forged a lie against Allah or has he gone mad?\" Nay! Those who believe not in the Hereafter are suffering a far-reaching delusion","34:9":"See they not what is before them and what is behind them of the heaven and the earth? If We so will, We can cause the earth to swallow them or bring down upon them a chunk of the heavens. There is indeed a sign in this for every obedient human turning in repentance to Allah","34:10":"And We certainly granted David favours from Us. \"O mountains and the birds! Sing Allah's praises with him (David).\" And We softened the iron for him","34:11":"Make armour (with the softened iron), and measure its links correctly. And do good deeds. I (Allah) do indeed see what you do","34:12":"And for Solomon (We made) the wind (subservient). It sailed a distance of a month's journey in the morning and a month's journey in the evening. And We made a fountain of molten brass to flow for him. And of the jinn there were those who worked under him by his Lord's command. And whoever from among them failed to act upon Our command, We made him taste the punishment of burning","34:13":"They made for him what he pleased — of prayer halls and statues, and bowls like water reservoirs and fixed cooking-pots. \"Do your work thankfully, O people of David!\" And few among My human subjects are grateful","34:14":"And when We decreed death on him (Solomon), nothing made them aware of his death but a creature of the earth that ate away the stick he was leaning on. So when he fell down, it made the jinn aware that, if they had knowledge of the unseen, they would not have continued to suffer in humiliation","34:15":"Certainly there was a sign for Sheba in their abode: two gardens, on the right and on the left. Eat of your Lord's provision and give thanks to Him. A good land and a Forgiving Lord","34:16":"But they turned away (from the Right Path). Then We sent upon them an inundating flood. And in place of their two gardens, We gave them two gardens yielding bitter fruit and growing tamarisk and some stunted Sidr","34:17":"We punished them thus because they suppressed the Truth. And We punish none but those who suppress the Truth","34:18":"And between them and the towns which We had blessed with our bounties, We had placed other townships within sight of one another to facilitate secure journeys therein, by night and by day","34:19":"But then they said, \"Our Lord! Make the stages of our journeys longer.\" And they wronged themselves! And We reduced them to just a tale among numerous other tales, and scattered them completely. Therein indeed are signs for anyone who is patient and grateful","34:20":"And the devil did certainly find his opinion concerning them come true. And they followed him, except for a group of the believers","34:21":"And he (Satan) holds no authoritative power over them, but that for Us his (satanic) influence distinguishes him who believes in the Hereafter from him who is in doubt concerning it. And your Lord monitors everything","34:22":"Say, \"Call upon those whom you consider gods besides Allah; they control not even the weight particle in the heavens or in the earth, nor have they any partnership in either creation. And He has no assistant from among them","34:23":"And intercession is of no avail with Him, except from him whom He permits. Until when fear is removed from their hearts, they (seekers of intercession) ask (those whom they considered to be their intercessors), \"What is it that your Lord said?\" They say, \"The Truth. And He is the Most High, the Great","34:24":"Say, \"Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?\" Say, \"Allah!

Those deemed to be weak say to those who were proud, \"Had it not been for you, we would have been believers","34:32":"The proud ones say to those deemed weak, \"Did we turn you away from the guidance after it had come to you!? Nay, you yourselves were guilty","34:33":"And those deemed weak say to those who had been proud, \"Nay, it was your night-and- day schemings to prod us to be ungrateful to Allah and set up other gods besides Him.\" And they keep their remorse to themselves when they see the punishment. And We put shackles on the necks of those who suppress the Truth. Are they getting back anything but for what they did","34:34":"And We sent not anyone to warn a township but the well-to-do in it said, \"We do indeed disbelieve what you are sent with","34:35":"And they said, \"We have abundance of wealth and children, and we are not going to be punished","34:36":"Say, \"My Lord does indeed amplify and straiten provisions for whomsoever He wills, but most of mankind knows this not","34:37":"And it is not your wealth, nor your children, that bring you close to Us; but (the piety of) one who believes and does good deeds. Such ones are entitled to double reward for what they do. And they are secure in their high positions","34:38":"And those who strive to work against Our Verses/signs, those will be brought for punishment","34:39":"Say, \"Surely my Lord gives the provision for living in ample measure — and restricts it — to whom He wills of His subjects. And whatsoever you spend, He compensates therefor. And He is the Best Provider","34:40":"And the Day He will gather them all together, and then ask the angels, \"Did they worship you","34:41":"They [the angels] will say, \"Glory to You! You are our Wali — not they! Nay, they worshipped the jinn; in them, most of them believed","34:42":"So that Day you will not be able to benefit or harm one another. And We will say to those who were wicked, \"Taste punishment by the Fire, which you used to deny","34:43":"And when Our clear Verses are recited to them, they say, \"This is not but a man who wants to turn you away from that which your fathers worshipped.\" And they say, \"It is nothing but a concocted lie!\" And those who suppressed the Truth say of the Truth when it comes to them, \"This is nothing but magic manifest","34:44":"And We had not given them any Books to read, nor did We send them, before you, a warner","34:45":"And those before them rejected the Truth. And these here now have not yet attained a tenth of what We gave them, and yet they (those before) rejected My Messengers! And how severe in effect was My forsaking them","34:46":"Say, \"I exhort you only to one thing: that you stand up for Allah in twos and alone, then ponder! There is no madness in your companion (Muhammad). He is but one to warn you of a severe punishment","34:47":"Say, \"Whatever reward I ask of you, it is only for you yourselves.

And they threw stones at the unseen from a place too distant","34:54":"And a barrier would be placed between them and that which they desire, as was done with those of their kind before. The sceptics would indeed be ever in doubt","35:1":"The praise is for Allah, Who originated the heavens and the earth, Who made the angels as messengers flying on wings, two, three, and four. He increases in creation what He wills. Allah is indeed Capable of doing anything","35:2":"Whatever of mercy Allah opens for mankind, there is none to wit old it. And what He wit olds none can send it thereafter. And He is Omnipotent, the Wise One","35:3":"O Mankind! Recall Allah's favours upon you. Is there any creator besides Allah who provides for you from the heavens and the earth? There is none worthy of worship but He. How then are you fooled by falsehood","35:4":"And if they reject you, Messengers before you were rejected too. And to Allah return all matters","35:5":"O mankind! Allah's promise is indeed true. So let not the lives of this world deceive you, nor let the arch-deceiver (the Satan) deceive you about Allah","35:6":"The devil is indeed your enemy, so take him for an enemy. He only invites his followers to be companions of the burning Fire","35:7":"Those who suppress the Truth, for them is a severe punishment. And those who believe and do good deeds, for them is forgiveness and a great reward","35:8":"Does he, whose evil deed is made to look enticing to him, consider it good!? Now, indeed, Allah lets go astray whom He wills and guides to the Right Path whom He wills. So let not yourself (Prophet) get affected with anxiety for them.

Likewise will the Resurrection happen","35:10":"If any do seek power and glory, then to Allah belongs all power and glory! To Him do words of purity rise, and He does exalt the good deed. And those who plan evil, for them there shall be a severe punishment! And their plan will perish","35:11":"And Allah created you from dust, then from fertilized ovum, and then He made male and female pairs of you. And no female bears, or delivers, except with His knowledge. And no one is granted a long life, or a shortened one, but it is all recorded in a book. This is indeed easy for Allah","35:12":"And the two seas are not alike: one sweet, thirst-queching, pleasant to drink; and the other salty, bitter.

And if any body weighed down by a burden calls attention to its heavy load, nothing of it will be carried by another, even though the latter be near of kin.

Those indeed who are too proud to worship Me — those will enter Hell humiliated","40:61":"It is Allah Who has made night for you to rest therein, and He has made day for you to see well therein. Allah is indeed most gracious on mankind, yet most people give no thanks","40:62":"That (Gracious One) is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things! There is none worthy of worship but He. How then are you fooled by falsehood","40:63":"Thus are they fooled who reject Allah's Verses","40:64":"It is Allah Who made the earth a dwelling-place for you and the sky, a generator of means to provide sustenance. And He shaped you and perfected your shapes, and has provided you with good things. That is Allah, your Lord. Blessed then is Allah, the Lord of the worlds","40:65":"He is the ever-living One. None is worthy of worship but He. So pray to Him, keeping your way of life exclusively for Him. Praise to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds","40:66":"Say, \"I am indeed forbidden to worship those whom you pray to besides Allah since clear evidences have come to me from my Lord, and I am commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds","40:67":"It is He Who created you from dust, then from a tiny seed of fertilized ovum, then from a clinging leech-like clot of blood. He then brings you out as a child, then facilitates you to attain to full strength and then to become old — though some among you die before — so that you reach an appointed term, and so that you understand (sentence continued to next Verse)","40:68":"(That) it is He Who gives life and causes death. When He ordains a thing, He just tells it, \"Be\" and it is","40:69":"Have you not seen those who dispute Allah's Verses/signs, how they are deviated","40:70":"Those who deny the Bookand that wherewith We sent Our Messengers. But they will come to know the Truth","40:71":"When they are dragged by chains, with iron collars around their necks","40:72":"Through boiling waters. Then they are burned in the Fire","40:73":"Then they are asked, \"Where are all those whom you worshipped","40:74":"(Worshipped) besides Allah?\" They reply, \"They have failed us; but what we used to pray to besides Allah before had no legitimacy to pray to at all!\" Thus does Allah send astray those that suppress the Truth","40:75":"(They are told,), \"You are in this sorry plight because you used to exult on earth without right, and because you used to be insolent","40:76":"Enter now the gates of Hell, to dwell therein. Evil then is the abode of the arrogant","40:77":"Do have patience then! Allah's promise is indeed true. And whether we let you see something of what We promise them, or We cause you to die, still to Us they will be brought back","40:78":"And We did send Messengers before you. We have told you about some of them, and We have not told you about the others. And it was not given to any Messenger that he should bring a (miraculous) sign save by Allah's leave. Then as Allah's decree comes, every matter is judged in accordance with the Truth, and the followers of falsehood will then be lost","40:79":"It is Allah Who has made cattle for you to ride on some of them — and you eat some of them","40:80":"And you have in them (cattle) benefits — and to satisfy by their means a need in your minds, you are carried upon them, as upon the ship","40:81":"And He continues to show you His signs. Which, then, of the signs of Allah do you deny","40:82":"Have they not travelled on earth to see what happened to those before them? Those were more in number than them, and stronger in power and influence on the earth. But what they earned availed them not","40:83":"And when their Messengers brought them clear evidences (of divine Presence) they exulted in the knowledge they themselves had. And the thing they mocked at besieged them","40:84":"Then, as they saw the severity of Our punishment, they said, \"We believe in Allah, the One and Only, and reject all those whom we had worshipped besides Him","40:85":"But their believing after seeing the severity of our punishment will be of no avail to them. This has always been Allah's law for His subjects. And then the suppressors of Truth will be doomed","41:1":"Ha Mim","41:2":"[This is] sent down from the Gracious, the Merciful","41:3":"[It is] a Book with its Verses well explained, [and it is] a recitation in Arabic for people with knowledge","41:4":"Heralding good news and giving warnings. And most of them turn away and listen not","41:5":"And they say, \"Our minds are immune to what you call us to, our ears are deaf thereto, and there is a barrier between us and you. So you act your way, we do indeed act our way","41:6":"Say, \"Although I am a man like you, it is revealed to me that the Entity worthy of worship by all of you is One and only One. So take the straight path to Him, and ask for gorgiveness of Him. And woe to all those who worship others besides Allah","41:7":"Those that do not give the Zakaat, and do not believe in the Hereafter","41:8":"Those indeed that believe and do righteous deeds, those will have an uninterrupted reward","41:9":"Say, \"Do you really deny Him Who created the earth in two spans of time, and set up equals to Him — Him, the Lord of all the worlds","41:10":"And, in four spans of time, He placed firm mountains rising above its surface, blessed it with plenty and growth, and ingrained within itself its provisions, sufficient for all needs","41:11":"Then He turned to the heaven, and it was all smoke. And He said to it and to the earth, `Come you both, willingly or unwillingly!' They both said, `We do willingly come","41:12":"Then He decreed it to become seven heavens in two spans of time, and ingrained in every heaven its function. And We adorned the nearest heaven with lamps (stars), and set it up as a guard (to protect the earth and life thereon). This is how the One Omnipotent, All-knowing has decreed","41:13":"If even then they turn away, tell them, \"I forewarn you of a thunderbolt like the one that struck (the ancient people of) AAad and Thamood","41:14":"When the Messengers came to them or to those who lived before or after them asking them not to worship any one but Allah, they all said, \"If our Lord had so pleased He would certainly have sent the angels down. So we do indeed reject what you are sent with","41:15":"So as regards AAad, they unjustly turned arrogant on earth, and said, \"Are there any people stronger than us?\" Did they not see that Allah Who created them was far greater in power than they? Yet they arrogantly denied Our signs","41:16":"Then We let loose on them a blowing wind for several calamitous days to make them taste a disgraceful punishment here in this world. And the punishment in the Hereafter will be far more disgraceful! And they will have none to help them","41:17":"And as regards Thamood, We did give them guidance, but they loved blindness over guidance! Then the thunderbolt of a humiliating punishment seized them because of what they earned","41:18":"And We saved those who believed and were pious","41:19":"And the Day Allah's enemies are gathered at the Fire and are then set in rows","41:20":"By the time they reach it (Fire), their ears and eyes and skins would have testified to what they had done","41:21":"And they ask their skins, \"Why did you testify against us?\" They reply, \"Allah — who gave all things the power of speech — made us speak. It is He who created you the first time, and to Him you will return","41:22":"You could never prevent your ears or eyes or skins from testifying against you. And you thought that Allah was mostly unaware of what you did","41:23":"It is this false notion you had of your Lord that ruined you, and you find yourselves among those doomed","41:24":"Whether they patiently bear their suffering or not, they shall continue to abide is Hell! And if they beg for favour, they shall not be among the recepients thereof","41:25":"And We had assigned to them companions who made their present and their past look good to them. And the fate that had once befallen the communities of jinns and men before them befell upon them. They were indeed doomed","41:26":"And those that suppress the Truth say, \"Do not listen to this Qur'an, and insert frivolities in it, so that you may prevail over the believers","41:27":"We shall make all those who suppress the Truth taste the severe punishment, and pay them back for the evil that they had perpetrated","41:28":"This — the Hell — is the requital for Allah's enemies. They will have therein their eternal home, as punishment for arrogantly denying Our signs","41:29":"Those who had suppressed the Truth will say, \"O Lord! Show us those among the jinns and human beings who had led us astray that we may trample them under our feet to render them among the lowliest of creatures","41:30":"Those indeed who say `Allah is Our Lord' and then remain steadfast, the angels come down to them saying, \"Fear not, nor regret, but rejoice in the glad news of Paradise that has been promised to you","41:31":"We are your close friends in this life and in the Hereafter. And in the Hereafter, you will get whatever you desire, and you will have therein whatsoever you ask for","41:32":"As gift from the One forgiving, merciful","41:33":"And who speaks better than one who calls to God, does things righteously, and says, \"I am indeed among those who submit to Allah","41:34":"And good and evil are not alike. Repel evil with what is good. Then one, between whom and you there was enmity, will be like a close friend","41:35":"And it is granted to none but those who exercise patience. And it is granted to none but those with a great endowment","41:36":"And if a mischief from the Satan affects you, seek refuge in Allah. HE is indeed the One who hears, knows","41:37":"And some signs of His are the night, the day, the sun and the moon. Prostrate not to the sun and the moon, and prostrate to Allah who created them, if you do truly worship Him","41:38":"But if they [Allah's subjects] are too arrogant to worship Him, then those that are close to your Lord do never get weary of singing His praises night and day","41:39":"And it is among His signs that the barren earth you see begins to stir and sprout when We send down rain upon it. He who gives it life will indeed also give life to the dead. He indeed has power over everything","41:40":"Those that effect distortion in Our Verses — they indeed are not hidden from Us! Who then is better: he who will be cast into Hell, or he who will come out safe on the Day of Resurrection? Do whatever you want; He does indeed see whatever you do","41:41":"Those that suppress the Reminder (Qur'aan) when it has come to them! It is certainly indeed a powerful Book","41:42":"Falsehood can enter it neither overtly nor covertly. It is a revelation sent down from One, wise and praiseworthy","41:43":"You have been told nothing but what was told to other Messengers before you. Your Lord is certainly indeed full of forgiveness, but also capable of giving severe punishment","41:44":"And had We made it a Qur'aan in a non-Arab tongue, they would surely have said, \"Why are its Verses not explained clearly — non-Arabic into Arabic?\" Say, \"It is guidance and cure for those who believe; and for those who do not believe, their ears are deaf thereto and their eyes blind. They are those to whom one calls from a place far away","41:45":"And We did give Moses the Book; but differences were created therein. And had the Word of your Lord not preceded it, matters would have been settled then and there among them. They are deeply in doubt and suspicion about it","41:46":"If one does a good deed, one does it for oneself. And if one does a bad deed, one bears its consequence oneself. And your Lord is not cruel to His subjects","41:47":"To Him goes back the knowledge of the Hour (the time when the present world will end and the Hereafter begin). No fruit comes out of its spathe, no female conceives or gives birth, but with His knowledge. And that Day He will call them out, \"Where are those whom you worshipped besides Me?\" They will answer, \"We confess to You none of us has seen them","41:48":"And those they prayed to before, will desert them. And they will realise there is no place for them to escape to","41:49":"Man never tires of praying for good. And if evil befalls him he gives up all hope","41:50":"And if We let him have a taste of Our mercy after some distress had afflicted him, he says, \"It was my due. I do not think the Hour will ever happen. And even if I am sent back to my Lord, there will surely still be the best for me with Him.\" We shall tell those who suppress the Truth what they used to do, and make them suffer severe punishment","41:51":"And when We shower Our favours upon man he keeps himself arrogantly aloof. And when anything bad happens to him, he prays a great deal","41:52":"Say, \"Do you see if this is from Allah and you deny it, would there be anyone more astray than he who is in such extreme rebellion","41:53":"We will show Our signs to them in the wide world outside and within themselves, until it becomes clear to them that it (Qur'aan) is the truth. Is it not sufficient that your Lord is Witness over all things","41:54":"Beware! They are indeed in doubt concerning their meeting their Lord. Beware! He does indeed encompass all things","42:1":"Ha-meem","42:2":"AAayn-seen-qaf","42:3":"THUS has Allah, the Omnipotent, the Wise, revealed to you, and to those before you","42:4":"To Him belong all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And He is the One exalted, great","42:5":"The heavens almost burst asunder from above them; and the angels sing their Lord's praise, and ask forgiveness for all on earth. Beware! Allah is indeed the One forgiving, merciful","42:6":"And those that take awliya other than Allah, He is watching them; and you (Prophet) are not a manager/dispenser of their affairs","42:7":"And thus do We reveal to you (Prophet Muhammad) Qur'aan in the Arabic tongue in order that you may warn the Mother (Makkah) of all cities and all those who dwell around it. And warn them of the Day of the Gathering [Resurrection Day] — no doubt at all that the Day is going to come — when some shall find themselves in paradise, and some in the blazing fire","42:8":"And had Allah so willed, He could surely have made them all one single community. However, He admits to His mercy whom He wills! And those that transgress limits set by Allah shall have no wali and none to help them","42:9":"Have they taken awliya other than Him? But Allah is the Wali. And it is He Who brings the dead to life. And it is He Who has the power to do anything","42:10":"And the resolution of your differences on any matter rests with Allah. [Say,] \"Such is Allah, my Lord! In Him have I placed my trust, and to Him do I always turn","42:11":"The Originator of the heavens and the earth! He has made for you mates of your own kind — just as He has made mates among the animals — to multiply you thereby. There is nothing like Him, and He is the One Who hears all, sees all","42:12":"He has the keys of the heavens and the earth. He provides abundantly to whom He wills, and restrictively to whom He wills. He does indeed know everything","42:13":"Ordained for you, for the right conduct of life, that which He had enjoined upon Noah — and which We revealed to you [Prophet Muhammad] — and that which We had enjoined upon Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Stand firmly by the Allah-ordained way of life, and break not your unity therein. What you call them to, appears a tall order to those who worship others besides Allah. Allah calls to Himself whom He wills, and guides to Himself one who turns to Him","42:14":"And they did not break up their unity, but only after they had received knowledge — out of mutual jealousy. And had it not been for a decree already issued from your Lord for a set term, their matter would indeed have been decided then and there. And those indeed who have inherited the Book after them are in grave doubt and suspicion about it","42:15":"To this [Qur'aan], then, you invite [all mankind], and persistently follow the course as prescribed [by Allah]. And follow not their vain desires. And say, \"I believe in whatever Writ Allah has sent down. And I am commanded to deal justly with problems amongst you. Allah is our Lord and He is your Lord as well. We are responsible for our deeds, and you, for yours. There is no contentious issue between us and you. Allah will bring us all together. And to Him is the final destination","42:16":"And those that would quarrel about Allah after the response He has been accorded, all their contentions are null and void in the sight of their Lord. And upon them will fall [His] wrath, and for them is severe suffering in store","42:17":"It is Allah Who has sent down the Book with the truth and the balance [wherewith to conduct one's life on principles of justice]. And who knows, the Hour (the time when the present world will end and the Hereafter begin) may well be near","42:18":"Those who do not believe in it ask for hastening it. And those who believe, fear it and know it to be the truth. Beware! Those who entertain doubts about the Hour have certainly indeed gone far astray","42:19":"Allah is most kind to His subjects. He provides for them as much as He wills. And He is most strong, the Omnipotent","42:20":"One who is desirous of a harvest in the Hereafter, We shall grant an increase in that one's harvest there. And one who is desirous a harvest in this world, We give him something thereof, And he will have no share in the blessings of the Hereafter","42:21":"Do they have gods, other than Allah, which enjoin upon them a religious law that Allah has not prescribed!? Had it not been for divine decree on the final judgment, their matter would indeed have been decided [in this world itself]. And, indeed, painful punishment awaits the wicked people","42:22":"You will see the wicked people fearful of what they have earned, and the evil effects of what they had earned falling back upon them, themselves. And [you will see] those who had believed and had done righteous deeds living among the flowering meadows of the gardens of Paradise. They shall have what they want, with their Lord. That is the greatest favour [a human being can achieve]","42:23":"That favour is what Allah gives the glad tiding of, to such of His subjects as believe and do righteous deeds. Say, \"No reward do I ask of you for this [Message] other than the love of the near and dear ones.\" And one who does anything good We increase for him the goodness thereof. Allah is indeed forgiving, appreciative of gratitude","42:24":"Do they say, \"He [Muhammad] has concocted a falsehood against Allah\"? But then, had Allah so willed, He could have sealed your heart. And Allah blots out all falsehood, and makes the truth prevail by His words. He is indeed aware of what goes on is in the minds [of human beings]","42:25":"And it is He Who accepts repentance from His subjects, pardons bad deeds, and it is He Who knows all that you do","42:26":"And He responds to those who believe and do righteous deeds, and He gives them more out of His Grace. And a rigorous punishment awaits those that suppress the Truth","42:27":"And had Allah given provisions in abundance to His subjects, they would commit transgressions on earth. And so He bestows provisions, in due measure, as He wills. He is indeed fully aware of [the needs of] His subjects","42:28":"And it is He who sends down heavy rain after people have despaired of it, and He spreads His Mercy thereby. He is the Wali, to whom all praise is due","42:29":"And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and of the living creatures He has caused to flourish in them both. And He has the power to gather them together whenever He wills","42:30":"And whatever calamity befalls you, it is becuse of what your own hands have earned. And much He pardons","42:31":"And you cannot do anything to frustrate Him on earth. And you have none to be your walih other than Allah, and none to help you","42:32":"And among His signs are the ships like some signboards [raised] in the sea","42:33":"If He so wills, He makes the wind still. And then they [ships] lie motionless on the sea's surface. In this indeed are signs for all who are patient and grateful","42:34":"Or He destroys them because of the evil they have earned. And much He pardons","42:35":"And let those who dispute Our messages know that there is no place for them to escape to","42:36":"So whatever you are given is but a [temporary] provision for life in this world. And that which is with Allah is better and lasting for those who believe and in their Lord place their trust","42:37":"And [that which is with Allah is better and lasting] for those who shun the greater sins and indecencies, and who, when in anger, readily forgive","42:38":"And [that which is with Allah is better and lasting] for those who have responded to their Lord and have established regular prayer. And their affairs are conducted by mutual consultation. And they spend out of what We have provided to them","42:39":"And [that which is with Allah is better and lasting] for those who defend themselves against tyranny","42:40":"And harm may be requited by an equal harm. But, then, the reward of one who forgives and reconciles rests with Allah. He [Allah] does indeed not love wicked persons","42:41":"And, certainly, no blame whatever attaches to anyone who defends oneself after having been wronged","42:42":"Blameworthy are but those who oppress people and unjustly commit transgression on earth: for them, a painful punishment","42:43":"And, certainly indeed, it is among the most resolute of acts for anyone to be patient and forgiving","42:44":"And he whom Allah lets go astray has no wali thereafter. And so you will see the evildoers [on Judgment Day] exclaim as soon as they behold the punishment, \"Is there any way back","42:45":"And you will see them brought up for the punishment, humbled in disgrace, looking around with a furtive glance. And those who had believed will say, \"Indeed, the doomed ones are those that have doomed themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection.\" Beware! The evildoers will suffer an eternal punishment","42:46":"And they will have no awliya to help them besides Allah! And he whom Allah lets go astray shall find no way out","42:47":"Respond to your Lord before a Day — on which there will be no turning back — comes, at Allah's behest. That Day you will have no place of refuge, and neither will you be able to resort to any denial","42:48":"Then if they respond not, We have not sent you [Prophet] to be their keeper. Your responsibility is but to deliver Allah's Message to the people correctly. And when We give man a taste of Our grace, he exults in it. And if misfortune befalls them as a result of what they have done, then, behold, man becomes ungrateful","42:49":"Allah's is the absolute sovereignty over the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He gives female offspring to whom He wills, and male offspring to whom He wills","42:50":"Or, He [Allah] gives a mixed, male and female, offspring, and makes whom He wills barren. He does indeed know everything, can do anything","42:51":"And man cannot receive an address by Allah otherwise than through inspiration, or from behind a veil, or through a Messenger [angel] revealing a divine Message by His [Allah's] leave. He is indeed Exalted, Wise","42:52":"And, likewise, have We revealed to you [Prophet Muhammad] a soul of a message, at Our behest! You did not know what the divine Writ is, or what belief means. Nonetheless, We have caused this Message [We have revealed to you] to be a light, whereby We guide whom We will of Our subjects. And, you do certainly guide people to the Straight Path","42:53":"[The Straight] Path of Allah, to whom all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth belongs. Verily, with Allah is the end of all matters","43:1":"Ha-mim","43:2":"By the Book that makes things clear","43:3":"We have made it a Qur'an [reading material] in Arabic, so that you understand","43:4":"And it is indeed in the Mother Book with Us, certainly [with contents] of the highest order and wisdom","43:5":"Should We then keep the divine Message away from you altogether as you are a people steeped in transgression","43:6":"And how many of the prophets did We send amongst the ancient peoples","43:7":"And no prophet did ever come to them but they mocked at him","43:8":"And We destroyed those that were stronger in power than these. And gone were the likes of the ancient peoples","43:9":"And were you to question them, `Who created the heavens and the earth?' they would surely reply, `the Omnipotent, the All-knowing did surely create them","43:10":"The One Who has made the earth spread out for you, and has made therein ways for you to travel by","43:11":"And the One Who sends down rain from the sky in due measure. And We raise to life therewith a land that is dead. You too will be raised likewise (when you are dead)","43:12":"And the One Who has created all things in pairs, and has made ships and cattle for you to ride on","43:13":"So that you may mount on their backs, and then remember your Lord's favour, while so mounted, and say, \"Glory to Him Who has made these subservient to us, and we could never have done this by ourselves","43:14":"And to our Lord, indeed, must we turn back","43:15":"And they created partners for Him from amongst His subjects! Man is certainly indeed openly ungrateful [to his Lord]","43:16":"Has He taken daughters out of what He himself creates, and chosen sons for you","43:17":"And when news is given to anyone of them of the birth of one [daughter] like what he allots [in a display of pernicious audacity] to the Gracious One, his face becomes darkened with suppressed anger","43:18":"[The man given the news of a daughter born to him thinks, \"Am I now saddled with an offspring] to be brought up in jewellery?\" And he lapses into a dilemma [whether to keep the child alive or kill her. Refer Verses]","43:19":"And they make angels, who themselves are subjects of the Gracious One, into females. Did they witness their creation? Their evidence will be recorded, and they will be questioned","43:20":"And they say, \"Had the Gracious One so willed, we should not have worshipped them (deities)!\" They have no knowledge thereof. Indeed, they do nothing but lie","43:21":"Had We given them a Writ before this, to which they are holding fast?h","43:22":"But they say, \"We did find our fathers following certain community rites, and we do indeed follow in their footsteps","43:23":"And, just the same way, We did never send a Warner before you to any people, but the affluent among them said, \"We did find our fathers following certain community rites, and we do indeed emulate them","43:24":"He [the Warner] said, \"How could you emulate them even when I brought you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following?\" They said, \"We do indeed deny that you are sent with any divine message at all","43:25":"We then penalised them. And see what end the liars met with","43:26":"And when Abraham said to his father and his people, \"I do indeed have nothing to do with what you worship","43:27":"(I do worship none) but Him Who made me, and He will certainly guide me","43:28":"And He [Allah] made it [what Abraham said] an enduring statement among those who came after him, that they may turn back [to Allah]","43:29":"Nevertheless, I did give means of livelihood to these and to their fathers, until the Truth came to them, and a Messenger manifest","43:30":"And when the Truth came to them, they said, \"This is deceptive magic, and we do indeed reject it","43:31":"And they say, \"Why is not this Qur'aan sent down to some leading man in either of the two cities","43:32":"Is it they who apportion the Mercy of your Lord? It is We Who apportion among them their livelihood in the life of this world! And We raise some of them above others in rank, so that some may take service from others. And the Mercy of your Lord is better than the worldly wealth they amass","43:33":"And were it not that mankind might all go the same (evil) way, We would provide, for everyone that becomes ungrateful towards the Gracious One, silver roofs — and staircases by which to go up — for their houses","43:34":"And for their houses doors, and couches on which they could recline","43:35":"And adornments of gold. And all these are nothing but conveniences of the present life. And the Hereafter, with your Lord, is for the Righteous","43:36":"If anyone turns away from remembrance of the Gracious One, We appoint for him a devil to be a companion to him","43:37":"And the devils do certainly indeed hinder them from the Path, and they think they are being guided aright","43:38":"Ultimately, when (such a one that turns away from Allah) comes to Us, he says (to the devil appointed as his companion), \"Would that I and you were as far apart as the two Easts are!\" And a wretched companion is that devil","43:39":"And the Day of Resurrection shall have nothing good for you when you have been wicked. Instead, you shall join others in getting punished","43:40":"Can you then make the deaf to hear, or show the way to the blind or to one gone far astray","43:41":"Even if We take you away, We shall not fail to exact retribution from them","43:42":"Or We shall show you what We have promised them; for, indeed, they are completely under our control","43:43":"So hold fast to the Revelation sent down to you. You are indeed on the Straight Path","43:44":"And it (the Qur'an) is certainly indeed the divine Message for you and for your people. And soon shall you (all) be brought to account","43:45":"And ask our Messengers whom We sent before you, \"Did We appoint any deities, other than the Gracious One, to be worshipped","43:46":"And We did send Moses, with Our Signs, to Pharaoh and his Chiefs: He [Moses] said, \"I am a Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds","43:47":"Then when he came to them with Our Signs, they ridiculed those Signs","43:48":"And We showed them not any Sign but that which was better than the one preceding. And We seized them with Punishment, so that they turn to Us","43:49":"And they said, \"O you magician! Invoke thy Lord for us since He has a covenant with you. We shall certainly be of those guided","43:50":"Then as We relieved them of the punishing calamity, they broke their word","43:51":"And Pharaoh issued a proclamation among his people, saying, \"O my people! Are not the dominion of Egypt mine and these streams flowing underneath?

They were indeed a people depraved","43:55":"Then as they incurred our displeasure, We exacted retribution from them, and drowned them all","43:56":"And We made them part of past history and example for later peoples","43:57":"When (Jesus) the son of Mary is mentioned by way of an example, your people protest","43:58":"And they say, \"Are our gods better, or he [Jesus]?\" They mention him to you not but by way of argument. Yes, they are a contentious people","43:59":"He [Jesus] was no more than a worshipper of Allah. We granted Our favour to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel","43:60":"And had We so willed, We could certainly have made angels, instead of you, to be our representatives on the earth","43:61":"And this [divine revelation] indeed is definite knowledge of the Hour (the time when the present world will end and the Hereafter begin). Have no doubt then about it, and follow Me. This is the Straight Path","43:62":"And let the Satan hinder you not [from the Straight Path]. Indeed, he is an open enemy to you","43:63":"And when Jesus came with clear Signs, he said, \"Verily, I have come to you with divine revelation spelling out Wisdom, and in order to make clear to you some of the (points) on which you differ. So fear Allah, and obey me","43:64":"Allah is indeed my Lord as also yours! So worship Him. This is the Straight Path","43:65":"Then the sects had differences among themselves.

And to Him shall you be brought back","43:86":"And those whom they invoke besides Allah have no power of intercession, except for one who bears witness to the Truth. And they know (they have no power)","43:87":"And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say, `Allah!' How then are they deluded (from His Guidance)","43:88":"And (their delusion induces the Prophet to) exclaim, \"O my Lord! These people will never believe","43:89":"Leave them alone then, and say \"Peace!\" Soon shall they know","44:1":"Ha-mim","44:2":"[Angels swear:] By the Book clear [Qur'aan]","44:3":"We have indeed sent it [the Qur'aan] down on a blessed night.

I do but follow what is revealed to me, and I am but a plain warner","46:10":"Say, \"Do you consider what could happen to you if it [Qur'aan] is from Allah and you suppress your belief in it, and a witness from among the Children of Israel testifies to the like thereof [Torah] and then believes, and you are too proud!?\" Allah does indeed not guide the people that are wicked","46:11":"And those who refuse to believe say of those who believe, \"Had it [the Qur'aanic revelations] been (any) good, they would not have preceded us to it.\" And since they would not be guided by it, they say, \"This is an ancient lie.\"h","46:12":"And, before it, the Book revealed to Moses [Torah] was leading guide and mercy. And this Book [Qur'aan], confirming [the guidance given in Torah], is in the Arabic language to warn those who wrong others and themselves and to bring good tidings for the righteous people","46:13":"Those indeed who say `Allah is Our Lord' and then remain steadfast, they shall have no fear then, nor shall they grieve","46:14":"They shall be inhabitants of the Garden (Paradise), living eternal lives therein as rewards for their deeds","46:15":"And We have commended to man to be kind to parents. His mother bears him in pain and in pain does she deliver him. And the bearing and feeding of him till he is weaned away from mother's milk takes thirty months. Then as he attains to full strength and reaches forty years of age, he says, \"My Lord! Inspire me to be thankful for the favour You have bestowed on me and on my parents, and to do righteous deeds that would please You. And make me righteous in the matter of my offspring. I do indeed turn to You in repentance, and indeed I am of those who submit","46:16":"Such are the ones from whom We accept the good of what they do, and overlook the bad. They shall be among the inhabitants of the Garden (Paradise) — a true promise given to them","46:17":"And he who says to his parents, \"Fie upon you both! Do you tell me that I shall be brought out (to life again) and generations before me have passed away!?\" And the two cry to Allah for help and say, \"Woe to you! Believe! Allah's promise is indeed true.\" But he says, \"These are nothing but fables of the ancient people","46:18":"Such are the ones among peoples of the jinn and mankind, which have passed away before them, on whom the divine Word has proved true. They indeed are the doomed ones","46:19":"And for all there will be ranks on the basis of what they do, so that He may justly compensate them for their deeds. And they will not be wronged","46:20":"And the Day those who suppress the Truth are exposed to the Fire: \"You squandered your good things in your worldly life to enjoy its pleasures. So this Day you are made to suffer the humiliating punishment because you were unjustly arrogant on the earth, and because you committed transgression","46:21":"And relate the story of the brother of AAad when he warned his people in the sand dunes — and warners did come and go before and after him — saying, \"Worship none but Allah.

I convey to you what I have been sent with, but I do see you are a people behaving ignorantly","46:24":"Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud coming toward their valleys, they said, \"Here is a cloud bringing us rain. But it is what you sought to hasten — a wind wherein is painful torment","46:25":"[A wind] destroying all things by its Lord's command! And by morning, nothing could be seen save their dwellings. We do thus `reward' the sinful people","46:26":"And We did certainly empower them with what We have not empowered you, and We had assigned to them ears and eyes and hearts. But then their ears and eyes and hearts availed those naught since they denied Allah's Verses/signs. And what they scoffed at surrounded them","46:27":"And We did certainly destroy habitations around you, and We had displayed to them Our Verses/signs, so that they might return to the Right Path","46:28":"Then why did those, whom they had taken as means — besides Allah — of approach to divinity, not help them? Nay! But they shunned them. And it was all their lie and forgery","46:29":"And when We directed toward you (Muhammad) a party of the jinn, who wished to hear the Qur'aan!

Shall any be destroyed [then] save the transgressing rebels","47:1":"Those that suppress the Truth and cause hindrance in Allah's Path — He will let all their deeds go waste","47:2":"And those who beieve and do righteous deeds and believe in what have been divinely sent down upon Muhammad — and that (what has been sent down) is the Truth from their Lord — He will efface their bad deeds, and He will set their condition right","47:3":"It is so because those who suppress the Truth pursue falsehood, and those who beieve pursue the Truth from their Lord. In this way does Allah give to mankind the similitudes of their lives","47:4":"Then when you confront in war those who suppress the Truth, smite their necks until you subdue them, and then take them securely into custody [as prisoners of war]. Thereafter [you may set them free,] either as an act of grace or against ransom, so that the burden of war is lifted. But thus it is — and had Allah so willed, He could indeed punish them Himself — so as to test you [all] by means of one another. And those that are killed in Allah's Path — He will never let their deeds go waste","47:5":"He will guide them, and set their condition right","47:6":"And He will admit them to the Garden [Paradise] as already described to them","47:7":"O you who believe! If you help Allah, He will help you, and He will consolidate your position","47:8":"And those that suppress the Truth — they are bound to face destruction, and Allah will let all their deeds go waste","47:9":"That is so because they hate what Allah has sent down. And He then causes their deeds to come to naught","47:10":"Have they not then travelled about on the earth and beheld what happened in the end to those who lived before their time? Allah brought about annihilation on them! And for those that suppress the truth, [He can bring about annihilations] like thereof","47:11":"That is because Allah is the Patron of all those who believe, whereas they who suppress the Truth have no Patron","47:12":"Allah will indeed admit all those who believe and do righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow. And those who suppress the Truth shall have — they may enjoy their life [in this world] and eat as cattle eat — the Fire [of the hereafter] for their abode","47:13":"And how many a city greater in power than this city [Makkah] of yours which has driven you out, [O Muhammad,] have We destroyed, and then nobody came to help them","47:14":"Is, then, he who stands on clear evidence from his Lord like one to whom one's bad deeds seem good? And people of the latter category follow but their own lusts","47:15":"[Consider] example of the Garden [Paradise] which the pious are promised. Therein are rivers of unpolluted water, and rivers of milk with unaltering taste, and rivers of wine delicious to drink, and rivers of purified honey. And therein they [the pious] shall enjoy all the fruits and forgiveness from their Lord. Can such pious persons be likened to persons who are to abide in the Fire and be given boiling water to drink that would cut off their intestines","47:16":"And among them are those who [apparently] listen to you, [O Muhammad,] and then, as soon as they leave you, say despisingly to those endowed with knowledge, \"What is it that he [Muhammad] has said?\" It is such as these whose hearts Allah has sealed; and they have followed but their own lusts","47:17":"And those that seek guidance — He improves them in guidance and gives them their piety","47:18":"Are they, then, waiting for the Hour (the time when the present world will end and the Hereafter begin) to come upon them of a sudden?

And ask forgiveness for your sins, [O Muhammad,] and for [the sins of] all other believing men and women. And Allah does know all your movements as well as your abodes","47:20":"And those who beieve say \"Would that divine revelation [as desired by us] is sent down!\" But now that an unambiguous revelation about war has been sent down, you [Muhammad] can see those, in whose hearts is a disease, looking at you with the look of one who is about to faint for fear of death! Far better for them woud be [continued to next Verse]","47:21":"[Far better for them woud be] obedience and a word of gratitude! Now that the matter is settled — [by the revelation concerning war] — it would certainly be for their good to remain true to Alah","47:22":"If you turn away, would you, then, spread corruption on earth, and cut asunder your ties of kinship","47:23":"Those are the ones whom Allah has cursed! So He made them deaf and blinded their sight","47:24":"Why do they not, then, ponder over this Qur'aan? Or are there locks upon their minds to keep it [Qur'aan] out","47:25":"Indeed, those [hypocrites] who turn on their backs after guidance that has been clearly given to them — the Satan prods them on, and he aids and abets them","47:26":"Because, they [hypocrites] say to those [unbelievers] who abhor what Allah has revealed, \"We will obey you in some matters.\" And Allah is aware of their secrets","47:27":"What then woud be their condition when, while the angels cause them to die, they strike at their faces and at their backs","47:28":"Because, they pursue what angers Allah and shun what pleases Him. And so He has made their deeds worthless","47:29":"Or do those, in whose hearts is a disease, think that Allah would never bring their crookedness to light","47:30":"And had We so willed, We could have shown them clearly to you, so that you would know them by their visible distinguishing marks. And you should certainly recognize them by tone of speech. And Allah knows what you all do","47:31":"And We certainly shall try you all to distinguish those of you who strive hard in Our cause and are patient in adversity. And We shall put to test all your assertions","47:32":"Indeed, they who suppress the Truth and cause hindrance in Alah's path, and cut themselves off from the Messenger after guidance clearly given to them — they can in no way harm Allah! And He will render all their deeds worthess","47:33":"O those who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and render not your deeds null and void","47:34":"Indeed, they who suppress the Truth and cause hindrance in Alah's path, and then die as suppressors of the Truth — Allah will not grant them forgiveness","47:35":"Be not then weak and call for peace while you have the upper hand. Allah is with you, and He will not leave you unrewarded for your deeds","47:36":"The life of this world is but sport and pastime. And if you believe in and fear Allah, He will repay you handsomely without asking you to part with your material possessions therefor","47:37":"Were He to ask and press for it [your material possessions], you would show your miserliness, and so Allah would bring your crookedness to light","47:38":"Here you are! It is you who are called upon to spend in Allah's Path. But then among you are those who are miserly! And one is miserly but towards one's own self. And Allah is the One self-sufficient, and you are the ones needy! And if you turn away [from Him], He will cause other people to take your place, and they will not be like you","48:1":"We have indeed granted you a clear victory","48:2":"[The victory was granted] in order that Allah may forgive you your past and future sins and complete His favour upon you and guide you to a straight path","48:3":"And [in order] that Allah might give you [Muhammad] powerful help","48:4":"It is He who sends down tranquillity into the minds of the believers, to add faith to their faith.

And Allah is Aware, Wise","48:5":"[Tranquillity is bestowed on beievers' minds] so that He might admit the believing men and believing women into Gardens, through which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever, and so that He might cleanse them of their evils. And that is, with Allah, the highest success","48:6":"And so that He might punish the hypocrites, men and women, and the polytheists, men and women, who imagine evil things about Allah. Evil time shall come upon them. And Allah is very angry with them. And He has cursed them and has prepared Hell for them. And an evil destination it is","48:7":"And to Allah belong all forces of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Omnipotent, Wise","48:8":"We have indeed sent you [Muhammad] as a witness, as a bearer of good tidings, and as a warner","48:9":"[We have sent Muhammad as such] so that you [people] may believe in Allah and His Messenger, and may assist Him, respect His Majesty, and glorify Him morning and evening","48:10":"Indeed, all who pledge their allegiance to you [Prophet Muhammad] pledge their allegiance to Allah! Allah's hand is over their hands. Hence, he who breaks his oath breaks it only to his own detriment. Whereas he who remains true to what he has pledged to Allah — he shall have a great reward bestowed upon him","48:11":"Those bedouins [nomadic Arabs staying in small oases in the desert and not in cities like Makkah and Medina] who remained behind [and did not accompany the Prophet in his mission] will say to you [Prophet], \"Our properties and our families kept us engrossed, so seek Allah's forgiveness for us.\" They will say with their tongues what is not in their minds. Say, \"Who then can intervene in the least on your behalf with Allah, if He wills to inflict any harm on you, or to give you any benefit? Allah is but well aware of all that you do","48:12":"You but thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families. And you were pleased, in your minds, with this thought. And you conceived an evil thought, and you became a people doomed","48:13":"And those who believe not in Allah and His Messenger — We have indeed prepared a blazing Fire for those who suppress the Truth","48:14":"To Allah belongs the absolute sovereignty over the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills, and punishes whom He wills. And Allah is forgiving and merciful","48:15":"When you [believers] set off to gather spoils of war, those that stayed behind [during war] will say, \"Let us follow you.\" They want to change Allah's word, but tell them, \"You shall not follow us. Allah has ordained so about you in advance.\" Then they will say, \"You are jealous of us.\" But little do they understand","48:16":"Tell the bedouins who stayed behind, \"You shall be summoned to fight against a militarily strong people, unless they submit. Then if you obey, Allah will grant you a good reward, but if you turn away as you did before, He will inflict on you a painful punishment","48:17":"No blame on the blind, or on the lame or the sick. And he who obeys Allah and His Messenger, Allah will admit him to Gardens through which rivers flow. And he who turns away, he shall be inflicted with painful punishment","48:18":"Allah was surely pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you [Prophet] under the tree! HE knew what was in their minds and so He made calmness descend on them and rewarded them with a victory that was to come in near future","48:19":"And [Allah rewarded them] with many future spoils of war to gather. And Allah is Omnipotent, Wise","48:20":"Allah has promised you many future gains [spoils of war] to gather, and He has hastened to you this one. And He has restrained the hands of people from harming you, so that it may be a sign for the believers, and so that He may guide you to a straight path","48:21":"And there are others [gains] which are still beyond your grasp, [but] which Allah has brought under His compass [for you]. And Allah is capable of doing anything","48:22":"If those who suppress the Truth were to fight you, they would certainly turn their backs. And then they would find neither a wali nor anyone else to help","48:23":"That was Allah's practice that prevailed in the past; and you shall find no change in Allah's practice","48:24":"And He it is who wit eld their hands from you, and your hands from them in the valley of Makkah, after giving you victory over them. Allah does see what you do","48:25":"They were those who suppressed the Truth, hindered you from going to the Sacred Mosque and prevented your offering from reaching its place of sacrifice. And [Allah would have commanded you to fight them] had it not been for the believing men and believing women [in Makkah] whom you might unwittingly have trodden down, and on whose account you might have, unknowingly, become guilty. [Allah wit eld your hands from the suppressors of Truth] so that He may bring whoever He will into His mercy. If they [the believers] had been clearly separated [from the non-believers], We would have punished those who have suppressed the Truth with a painful punishment","48:26":"While those who suppress the Truth made it, in their minds, a matter of pride — the pride of the days of ignorance — Allah sent down a sense of calmness and tranquillity from Him on to His Messenger and the believers and made them adhere to the principle of piety. And they were entitled to it [piety] and were worthy of it. And Allah has knowledge of all things","48:27":"Allah was of course right in showing His Messenger a truthful vision. Allah willing, you will most certainly enter the Sacred Mosque in safety and without fear, with heads shaven or with hair cut short. Allah knew what you did not! So He has given you this victory before that one","48:28":"He is the One who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the true way of life [Islam], so that He may have it prevail over all [other] ways of life. And Allah suffices as a witness","48:29":"Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Those who are with him are firm and strict with those who suppress the truth, but compassionate towards one another. You see them bowing and prostrating to seek favours from Allah and His pleasure. Their distinguishing marks — the results of their [frequent] prostrations — are on their faces. They are likened in the Torah and in the Gospel to a seed which sends out its shoot and then strengthens it. It then becomes thick, and stands firm on its own stem, delighting the farmers. [Allah has so developed the character of believers] to enrage, through them, those who suppress the Truth. Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward to those of them who believe and do good deeds","49:1":"O you who believe! Do not push yourself forward in the presence of Allah and his Messenger, and fear Allah. Allah does indeed hear all, know all","49:2":"O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the Prophet's voice, nor speak loudly to him as you speak loudly to one another, lest your deeds become unwittingly worthless","49:3":"Those indeed who lower their voices before Allah's Messenger — they are those whose minds Allah has tested for piety. For them there is forgiveness and a great reward","49:4":"Those indeed who call out to you [Prophet] from outside the private chambers — most of them have no sense","49:5":"And had they been patient till you [Muhammad] come out to them, it would have been better for them. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful","49:6":"O you who believe! Should a depraved person bring you news, examine it critically, lest you harm a people in ignorance, and then be sorry for what you did","49:7":"And beware! Allah's Messenger is amongst you. Were he to obey you in most matters, you would surely be in trouble. But Allah has endeared the faith to you and has made it seem good in your minds. And He has made hateful to you suppression of the Truth and transgression and disobedience. Those are the ones rightly guided","49:8":"A favour from Allah and a bounty! And Allah is Omniscient, Wise","49:9":"And if two parties of the believers quarrel, make peace between them. Then if one of them does wrong to the other, fight that one which does wrong, till it returns to Allah's command. Then, if it returns, make peace between them with justice and act equitably. Allah does indeed love those that are equitable","49:10":"The believers are but brethren. So make peace among your brothers! And fear Allah so that mercy is showered upon you","49:11":"O you who believe! Let not one community laugh at another, lest the latter be better than the former. Nor let women laugh at other women, lest the latter be better than the former. Insult not your own people, or call one another by nick-names. It is bad to be called by a name indicating transgressions against divine law after attaining to faith. And one that turns not in repentance — such are the wicked ones","49:12":"O you who believe! Avoid most of speculation! Speculation in some cases indeed is sin. And spy not on one another, nor let some of you backbite on others. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would abhor it! And fear Allah! Allah is indeed Acceptor of repentance, Merciful","49:13":"O mankind! Verily We have created you from one man and one woman, and made you into nations and tribes in order that you may know one another. The noblest of you with Allah is indeed the one most pious of you. Allah is indeed Omniscient, Well-informed","49:14":"The Bedouin [nomadic] Arabs say, \"We do believe.\" Say, \"You believe not, but you should say, `We submit' and the faith has not yet entered your minds! And if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not deprive you of any benefits accruing from your deeds. Allah is indeed Forgiving, Merciful","49:15":"The believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger. Then they doubt not, and struggle hard with their wealth and their lives in the way of Allah. Those are they who are the true believers","49:16":"Say, \"Would you teach Allah what your religion is!? And Allah knows whatever there is in the heavens and whatever there is in the earth. And Allah knows all things","49:17":"They think that by becoming Muslims they have done a favour to you. Say, \"You have done no favour to me by becoming Muslims! Allah, on the other hand, has done you a favour by guiding you to the faith, if you would but speak the truth","49:18":"Allah does indeed know the secrets of the heavens and the earth. And Allah sees all that you do","50:1":"Qaf. By the Glorious Qur'aan, [We swear its authenticity]","50:2":"But they wonder that there has come to them a Warner [from Allah] from among themselves. So the suppressors of the Truth say, \"This is a strange thing","50:3":"What! When we die and have become dust, (shall we rise again to life?) That is a return far [from being ever possible]","50:4":"We do know what the earth takes away from them. And with Us is a record protected","50:5":"But they deny the Truth when it comes to them. And so they are in a confused state of mind","50:6":"Do they not look at the sky above them — how We have made it and adorned it, and see that there are no cracks in it","50:7":"And We have spread out the earth and cast mountains into it. And We have caused every kind of beautiful spouse of herbage grow in it","50:8":"To be observed and commemorated by every devotee turning to Allah","50:9":"And We send down from the sky rain as a blessing, and We produce therewith gardens and seed for the harvest","50:10":"And tall palm-trees, with shoots of fruit-stalks, piled one over another","50:11":"A provision for (Allah's) subjects. And We give life therewith [with rain] to land that is dead. Thus will the coming out of the dead from their graves [Resurrection] be","50:12":"[Resurrection] was denied before them by the People of Noah, the Companions of the Rass, and the Thamood","50:13":"And of AAad, of Pharaoh, the brethren of Lot","50:14":"The Companions of the Wood, and the People of Tubba' (an ancient tribe) — all of them rejected the Messengers, and My warning (to them) was duly fulfilled","50:15":"Were We then weary with the first Creation that they should be in such a confused state of mind about a new Creation","50:16":"And We did create man, and We know the promptings of his own self. And We are closer to him than any bodily channel having access into his brain","50:17":"When the two frequently confronting voices, one located on the right and one on the left, confront each other","50:18":"He utters not a word but is there a sentinel by him, ready [to record it]","50:19":"And the pangs of death will bring the Truth home to him. \"This was the thing you kept away from","50:20":"And then the Trumpet is blown — there then is the Day promised","50:21":"And every soul comes forth accompanied by a driver and a witness","50:22":"You were careless about this. Now that We have taken off your cover from you, strong is your eyesight this Day","50:23":"And his Companion [witness] says, \"It's ready here — what in my hand is [man's record]","50:24":"Throw into Hell every stubborn suppressor of evidence proving existence of Allah [with attributes as given in the Qur'aan]","50:25":"Who was forbidding what was good, transgressing all bounds, and casting doubts and suspicions","50:26":"Who had set up other god/s besides Allah! So throw him into the severe punishment","50:27":"His Companion says, \"Our Lord! I did not make him transgress, but he was (himself) gone far astray","50:28":"He [Allah] says, \"Quarrel not in My Presence; and I did send you the warning in advance","50:29":"No alteration in the Word with Me, and I am never unjust to My subjects","50:30":"That Day We ask Hell, \"Are you full?\" And it asks, \"Are there any more","50:31":"And the Garden [of Paradise] is brought near for the pious and righteous, and it is no longer a distant objective [for them]","50:32":"This is what you were promised. [And this is what was promised] to every one who turned (to Allah in sincere repentance) and protected (himself against satanic influence)","50:33":"Who feared the Gracious One without physically seeing Him with worldly eyes, and has come with a mind turned in devotion (to Him)","50:34":"Enter therein [in Paradise] in Peace and Security; this is time of eternal life","50:35":"There is for them therein all that they desire.

And if you are attacked, we shall help you.\" Allah bears witness that they are certainly indeed liars","59:12":"If they [the Jews] are driven out, they [hypocrites] will certainly not go with them. And if they [the former] are attacked, they [the latter] will not help them. And even if the hypocrites go to help the Jews, the former will turn their backs in flight, and then the latter will not get any help","59:13":"They are more afraid of you in their minds than of Allah. That is because they are a people who understand not","59:14":"They will fight you not all together but from within fortified strongholds or from behind walls. There is much animosity within them. You think they are united, but their hearts are divided. That is because they are unreasonable people","59:15":"Like those who [had to leave] just before them, they have tasted the evil consequences of their doings. And they shall have a painful punishment","59:16":"[The hypocrites are] like the Satan, when he tells man to suppress the Truth! But when man suppresses the Truth, he [Satan] says, \"I do disassociate myself from you; I do fear Allah, the Lord of the Universe","59:17":"Then, the end of them both [man suppressing the Truth and the Satan] will be that they will be in the Fire, therein to abide.

And return to them [the non-believers] what they had spent [on their former wives by way of mehr or obligatory marriage gift]. And you will be committing no sin if you then marry them after giving them their mehr. And hold not to the marriage-tie with women who continue to suppress the truth, and you may ask for the return of mehr you had spent on them. And, certainly, the non- believers [whose wives have come over to you] have the right to demand the mehr they had spent. That is Allah's Decree! He decrees on matters between you.
