How little they believe","2:89":"And when a Book came to them from God confirming what they have, while they were themselves asking for help against the unbelievers, they did not believe the Book. Although they recognized [the truth], they denied it. God rejects the unbelievers","2:90":"They sell their souls for nothing of value, denying what God has revealed out of resentment that God reveals his grace to whomever He will from among his worshipers.

Not that Solomon himself was one who denied the truth; it was the evil ones who denied the truth. They taught people witchcraft and what was revealed in Babylon to the two angels Harut and Marut, although these two never taught it to anyone without first declaring, \"We are nothing more than a temptation to evil: Do not deny [God's] truth.\" From these two, they learned what can separate a man from his wife, although they harm no one with it except with God's permission. They learned what harmed them, not what benefited them, knowing full well that whoever acquired [this knowledge] would have no share in the Hereafter.

God discerns what you do","2:111":"They said, \"Only Jews and Christians will enter heaven.\" That is their wishful thinking.

You will not be held accountable for those who are going to Hell","2:120":"The Jews and Christians will not be pleased with you until you follow their ways.

He guides whoever wants to be guided to a straight path","2:143":"We have made you a moderate nation, so that you may bear witness to humanity and the Messenger may bear witness to you. We made your former prayer direction only so that we could know who would follow the Messenger and who would turn away from him. This change was too much to bear except for those whom God has guided. God will surely not lose sight of your faith. God is compassionate and Merciful-to-all people","2:144":"We have seen you turning your face towards the heavens, so We will certainly turn a prayer direction for you that will please you.

God is forgiving and Merciful-to-all","2:183":"Believers, God commanded fasting for you just as he commanded it for those who came before you so that you might be mindful of God","2:184":"Fast for a specific number of days, and if someone is sick or traveling, then alternate days. For those who can afford a redemption should feed a poor person. If someone voluntarily does good, it is goodness for him. Fasting is good for you, if you only knew","2:185":"The month of Ramadan is when the Qur'an was revealed, giving guidance to humanity, and clear messages of guidance and a standard for distinguishing right from wrong. Whoever lives to see this month should fast. Whoever is sick or traveling should fast on alternate days. God wants it to be easy for you, not hard, so you can complete the days you missed. So praise God for his guidance to you, and give thanks","2:186":"If My worshipers ask you about Me, I am near, answering the prayer of the one who prays to Me. They should respond to Me and believe in Me in order to be guided","2:187":"Sex with your wives is permitted on the night of a fast. They are clothing to you, and you to them. God knows that you used to betray yourselves, so He turned to you and forgave you. So now, have sex with them, and seek what God has ordained for you. [You may] eat and drink until you can distinguish a white thread from a black one in the dawn, then complete the fast until night. Do not have sex with them while you are secluded in the places of worship. These are God's boundaries. So don't go near them. This is how God shows people His messages so that they would be mindful of Him","2:188":"Do not abuse other people's wealth using wrong means, and do not bribe authorities in order to take possession of other people's wealth knowingly and sinfully","2:189":"They ask you about new moons. Say, \"They show times for people and for the Hajj.\" It is not right to enter houses from the back. Rather, righteousness is to be mindful of God and to enter houses through their front doors. Always be mindful of God, so that you may succeed","2:190":"Fight in God's path against those who fight you, but do not be aggressors, for God does not love aggressors","2:191":"[If they start a fight] kill them wherever you find them, and expel them from wherever they expelled you. For oppression is worse than murder. Do not fight them at the Holy Sanctuary unless they fight you in it. If they fight you, kill them. That is the reward of the unbelievers","2:192":"If they stop, God is forgiving and Merciful-to-all","2:193":"Fight them until there is no more persecution and until all worship is devoted only to God. If they stop, there should be no aggression except toward the unjust","2:194":"Fight back during the sacred month: violation of sanctity [calls for] just retribution. Whoever attacks you, attack them as you were attacked. Be mindful of God, and know that God is with those who are mindful of Him","2:195":"Spend your money in the path of God, and do not contribute to your own destruction, but do good. God loves those who do good","2:196":"Do your Hajj and the Umrah for God. If you are prevented, then send what offerings for sacrifice are possible, and do not shave your heads until the offerings arrive. If one of you is sick or has a head injury, then one can be redeemed by fasting, giving the purifying alms or offering a sacrifice. When you are secure, whoever breaks one's purification between the Umrah until the Hajj should offer whatever sacrifice one can; or, if one cannot, one should fast three days during the Hajj, and then seven when one returns, ten days in all. This [observance] is for those whose families are not present at the Sacred Sanctuary. Be mindful of God, and know that God is severe in punishment","2:197":"The Hajj is in the prescribed months; for him who decides to perform the Hajj, there should be no vulgarity, bad behavior, or argument during the Hajj. God knows the good deeds you do, so do lots of them. And take provision for yourself. The best of all provision is being mindful of God. So be mindful of Me, you who have insights","2:198":"It is not wrong to seek your Lord's blessing. So when you flow down from [Mount] Arafat, remember God at the sacred place. Remember Him as He guided you after you had gone astray","2:199":"Then surge onward with all the others, and ask God's forgiveness. He is forgiving and Merciful-to-all","2:200":"When you have completed your rituals, remember God at least as much as you remember your fathers, or even more. Some people say, \"Our Lord, bless us in this world.\" They have no share in the Hereafter","2:201":"Others say, \"Our Lord, give us goodness in this world and goodness in the Hereafter. Protect us from the punishment of Hell","2:202":"Those have the portion of blessings they deserve. God is swift in reckoning judgment","2:203":"Remember God on certain appointed days. Whoever completes the process in two days is not guilty, and whoever stays longer out of minding God will not be guilty. Know that you will be gathered to Him","2:204":"Among the people there is a kind of person whose view of this life pleases you. He even calls God as witness to what is in his heart, yet he is the fiercest of [your] opponents","2:205":"When he leaves you, he goes throughout the land, spreading corruption, destroying crops and animals. God does not like corruption","2:206":"If he is told, \"Be mindful of God,\" arrogance leads him to sin. He is headed to Hell, a dreadful destination","2:207":"Some people give their life away, desiring God's pleasure. God is compassionate to His worshipers","2:208":"Believers, enter wholeheartedly into submission to God, and do not follow the steps of Satan; he is clearly your enemy","2:209":"If you should stumble after clear signs have come to you, be aware that God is Powerful and Wise","2:210":"Are these people waiting to see God and the angels coming to them in a formation of clouds? At that point, the matter would already be over. All matters are referred to God","2:211":"Ask the Children of Israel how many times We brought them clear signs. If anyone alters God's grace after having received it, God is stern in punishment","2:212":"This life has been made attractive to the unbelievers, and they ridicule the believers, but those who are mindful of God will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. God provides bountifully for all He wills","2:213":"Human beings were [once] all one nation. God sent prophets carrying good news and warnings, and with them He sent the Book in Truth to judge between people in matters on which they differ. Yet rivalry between those who received it led them to disagreement, even after having received clear signs. God willingly guided believers to the truth about which they differed. God guides whoever wants to be guided into a straight path","2:214":"Or do you think you will enter Heaven without experiencing the trials of those who were before you. They experienced misery, hard times, and they were so shaken that even their messenger and the believers with him cried, \"When will God's help arrive?\" Truly, God's help is near","2:215":"They ask you [Prophet] what they should contribute. Say, \"The possessions you contribute should be for parents, relatives, orphans, the poor, and the stranded traveler.\" God is fully aware of all the good you do","2:216":"Fighting is ordained for you, even though it repulses you. You may hate something that is good for you, or love something that is evil for you. God knows, but you do not","2:217":"They ask you about fighting during the sacred month. Say, \"Fighting in it is a big offense. But turning people away from the path of God, denying Him, preventing access to the Sacred Sanctuary, and expelling its residents is a bigger offense to God because sedition is a bigger offense than murder. They will not stop fighting you as long as there is the possibility of turning you away from your faith. But if any of you denies the faith and dies in a state of unbelief, their deeds will come to nothing in this world and the Hereafter. They will be in Hell, where they will remain forever","2:218":"Those who have believed and journeyed and struggled in God's path, they may hope for God's mercy. God is forgiving and Merciful-to-all","2:219":"They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say, \"There is great sin in them, and also some benefit for humankind. The sin is greater than the benefit.\" They ask you what they should contribute. Say, \"Whatever you can possibly give.\" Thus God makes signs clear to you so that you might think about","2:220":"this world and the Hereafter. They ask you about orphans, say, \"Improving their lot in life is good. If you mingle your affairs with them, [they are] your brethren.\" God knows the difference between one who corrupts and one who improves things. If God had wanted, He would have made things difficult for you. God is strong and wise","2:221":"Do not marry idolatrous women until they believe; a believing slave woman is better than an idolatrous woman even if she pleases you. And do not give your women in marriage to idolaters until they believe. A believing slave is better than an idolater, even if he pleases you. They [idolaters] invite [you] to Hell, whereas God calls for Heaven and forgiveness by His permission. He makes his signs clear to people so that they may remember","2:222":"They ask you about menstruation. Say, \"It is painful, so keep away from women during their menstruation, and do not approach them until they are purified. When they are purified, you may approach them the way God has ordained you.\" God loves the repentant and the purified","2:223":"Your wives are a field for you, so go into your fields however you want and do beforehand all that is necessary, being fully mindful of God and knowing that you will meet Him. Give good news to the believers","2:224":"Do not use your oaths to God as an excuse for not doing good, being mindful of God, and making peace between people. God hears all and knows all","2:225":"God does not blame you for foolishness in your oaths, but only as your hearts deserve. God is forgiving and gentle","2:226":"To those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives, there is a waiting period of four months; if they change their minds, God is forgiving and Merciful-to-all","2:227":"If they insist on divorce, God hears all and knows all","2:228":"Divorced women will wait three menstruation periods [before re-marrying], for they are not allowed to hide what God has created in their wombs if they believe in God and the Last Day. Their husbands are entitled to take them back if they want to be reconciled. But, in accordance with justice, the rights of the wives [with regard to their husbands] are equal to the [husbands'] rights with regard to them, although husbands have a degree [of right] over them. God is almighty and wise","2:229":"Divorce is allowed twice, after which keep [your wives] kindly, or dismiss them generously. You [husbands] may not take back anything you have given them unless both of you fear that they may not be able to keep within the limits set by God. It is not then wrong for them if she buys her way out. These are God's limits, do not exceed them. Anyone who exceeds them is unjust","2:230":"If he divorces her [for the third time], she is no longer allowed to remarry him until she marries another husband. Then, if [the latter] divorces her, it is not wrong for them to return [to each other] if they think that they can observe God's limits. These are the bounds set by God, which He makes clear to people who have knowledge","2:231":"If you divorce [your] women, and their waiting term is complete, either take them back kindly or let then go kindly. Do not take them back in order to harm them or to treat them belligerently. Anyone who does that sins against himself. Do not mock God's revelations, but remember God's grace to you and what He revealed to you from the Book and the wisdom through which He exhorts you. Be mindful of God, and know that God knows everything","2:232":"If you divorce women and their waiting term is complete do not prevent them from marrying their new husbands if they come to a fair agreement. This instruction is to all who believe in God and the Last Day. This [way] is the most virtuous and purest for you. God knows, and you do not","2:233":"Mothers should nurse their children for two complete years if they wish to complete the nursing period. Their provision and clothing are, in fairness, the father's responsibility. No soul should be burdened with more than it can possibly bear; neither should a mother be made to suffer because of her child, nor a father because of his child. An heir has similar duties. If both [parents] decide to separate, they will incur no sin. Nor will there be any blame if you decide to employ a wet nurse, provided you ensure the child's safety in a fair manner. But remain mindful of God, and know that God sees all that you do","2:234":"Widows of those who die among you must wait four months and ten days [prior to remarrying]. When they complete their waiting period, you are not to be blamed for what they may choose to do lawfully with themselves. God is aware of what you do","2:235":"You will not be blamed whether you publicly announce that you want to marry these women or decide to keep your proposal to yourself; God knows your intentions to propose to them. Do not make a secret arrangement with them, but speak decently to them, and do not confirm the marriage contract until the prescribed period is finished. And you should know that God knows what is in your soul, so be mindful of Him. Remember that God is most forgiving, most forbearing","2:236":"There is nothing wrong with divorcing your wives before you have touched them or paid them their dowry, but make fair provision for them, the rich according to his means and the poor according to his. This is a duty for those who behave righteously","2:237":"If you divorce them before you touch them, but after you have given them their dowry, then let them have half of it, unless they renounce [their claim], or unless the one making the marriage-tie renounces it. Renouncing [the portion] is closer to being mindful of God. Do not forget the grace that is between you. God sees what you do","2:238":"Always be mindful of prayers and perform the intermediate prayer and stand devoutly before God","2:239":"But If you fear danger, pray [whether you are] walking or riding, and remember God when you are safe again, because it is He Who has taught you what you did not know","2:240":"Those of you who die and leave wives should have a will with a provision giving their widows a year without being driven from their homes. If they leave [on their own], you will not be blamed for what they may reasonably choose to do with their lives. God is strong and wise","2:241":"Divorced women should be provided for adequately. This is an obligation on those who are mindful of God","2:242":"God thus makes his revelations clear to you, so that you might understand","2:243":"Did you not see the thousands who left their homes to avoid death? God told them, \"Die.\" Then he made them alive again. God is gracious to people, but most people do not give thanks","2:244":"Fight in God's path, and know that God hears all and knows all","2:245":"Who will make a good loan to God, which He will repay many times over? It is God who withholds, and it is He Who gives abundantly, and it is to Him you will return","2:246":"Did you not see how, after Moses' time, the leaders of the Children of Israel told one of their prophets, \"Raise up a king for us, and we will fight in God's cause\"? He said, \"If it is God's will for you to fight, would you refuse?\" They answered, \"Why should we not fight in God's cause when we and our children have been driven from our homelands?\" Yet, when they were commanded to fight, all but a few of them turned away. God has full knowledge of the unjust","2:247":"Their prophet told them, \"God has chosen Saul as your king.\" They said, \"How can he be our king? We are more deserving of being king than he. He does not have a lot of money.\" He said, \"God has chosen him over you, and has endowed him with knowledge and physical strength. God gives his kingdom to whomever He wills.\" God is Infinite, All-Knowing","2:248":"Their prophet told them, \"The sign of his royal authority is that the Ark of the Covenant will come to you, carried by angels, bearing inner peace from your Lord as well as reminders of the family of Moses and Aaron. If you believe, that is a sign for you","2:249":"When Saul divided the troops, he said, \"God will test you at a river. Whoever drinks from it is not with me, and whoever does not taste it is with me, except for those who scoop up a handful.\" All but a few drank from it. When he and the believers crossed it together, they said, \"We do not have any strength against Goliath and his troops today.\" Those who thought they were about to meet God said, \"How often small groups have defeated large groups by God's authority. God is with those who endure","2:250":"When they met Goliath and his troops, they said, \"Lord, give us endurance and make our feet firm and save us from the unbelievers","2:251":"So, with God's approval, they defeated them. David killed Goliath, and God gave him the kingdom and wisdom, and taught him what He willed. If God had not driven some back by means of others, the earth would have been corrupted, but God shows grace to people","2:252":"These are God's revelations, which We recite to you [Prophet] in Truth. You are one of the messengers","2:253":"We preferred some of those messengers over others. God spoke to some, and He raised some in degree; We gave Jesus son of Mary clear signs, and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. If God had willed, those after them would not have fought each other after clear evidence of the truth had come to them, but they fought. Some of them believed, and others denied the truth. If God had willed, they would not have fought. But God does whatever He wants","2:254":"Believers, contribute some of what We have provided you before a day comes when there is no bargaining, nor friends, nor intercession. Those who have denied the truth are unjust","2:255":"God is the only god, the Eternal and Self-Sustainer. He neither slumbers nor sleeps. He owns what is in the heavens and the earth. Who is he who intercedes with Him except with His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them. They know nothing of His knowledge except what He wills. The throne of His majesty covers the heavens and the earth, and protecting them does not tire Him. He is Most high and Tremendous","2:256":"There is no compulsion in religion. The difference between guidance and error has been made clear. Whoever rejects false gods and believes in God has grasped a firm, unshakable support. God hears all and knows all","2:257":"God protects believers and brings them out of the darkness of ignorance into enlightenment. False gods are the protectors of the unbelievers, bringing them out of enlightenment into the darkness of ignorance. They will be eternally in Hell","2:258":"Have you not considered the one who was given a kingship by God [and] then disputed with Abram about his Lord? Abram said, \"My Lord gives life and causes death.\" He said, \"I also give life and death.\" Abram said, \"God brings the sun from the East. So bring it from the West.\" The disbeliever was dumfounded. God does not guide unjust people","2:259":"Or, [consider] the one who passed by a town which had fallen into ruin. He said, \"How can God bring back those who were once alive here after their death?\" God made him die for a hundred years, and then resurrected him. He said, \"How long have you stayed?\" He said, \"A day or part of a day.\" He said, \"You stayed for a hundred years. Look at your food and your drink. They have not gone bad. Look at your dead donkey. We will make you a sign for people. Look how We raise the bones, and then cover them with flesh.\" When he saw it, he said, \"I know that God has power over all things","2:260":"Abram said, \"My Lord, show me how you give life to the dead.\" God said, \"Have you not believed?\" He said, \"Yes I have, but assure my heart.\" God said, \"Take four birds, kill them and cut them into pieces. Then put pieces of each on a mountain and call them. They will come quickly to you. Know that God is Strong and Wise","2:261":"Those who contribute their money in God's way are like a seed that sprouts seven heads, in each of which are a hundred grains. God grants such multiple increase to whom He wills. God is Infinite and All-Knowing","2:262":"Those who spend their money in God's way and then do not follow what they spend with reproach or harm will have a reward from their Lord. They will neither fear nor grieve","2:263":"A kind word and forgiveness are better than charity followed by hurt. God is Rich beyond need and Forbearing","2:264":"Believers do not ruin your charitable deeds with reproach and harm like one who does not believe in God or the Last Day and contributes his money so people will see him. He is like a rock with dirt on it that was rained upon heavily and became hard and bare. Such people can do nothing with what they earned. God does not guide disbelieving people","2:265":"Those who spend their money seeking God's pleasure and as an affirmation of their own faith are like a garden on a hill when heavy rain falls on it-it doubles its produce-and if heavy rain does not fall, there is dew. God sees what you do","2:266":"Do any of you want to have a garden with date palms and vineyards, with flowing rivers , having every kind of fruit, to then be overtaken by old age, with only weak children, and then a fiery whirlwind strikes it and burns it up? Thus God shows you signs so that you may contemplate","2:267":"Believers, contribute some of the good things You have earned, and of what We have produced for you from the earth. Do not choose the worst of it to give in charity that you yourself would be reluctant to accept. Know that God is Rich beyond need and Praiseworthy","2:268":"Satan promises you poverty and orders you to commit immoral acts. God promises you His forgiveness and esteem. God is Infinite, All-Knowing","2:269":"He gives wisdom to whom He chooses, and whoever is given wisdom is blessed abundantly. But only insightful people bear this in mind","2:270":"God knows what you contribute or what you vow. The unjust have no one to save them","2:271":"If you give charity visibly, it is good. But if you hide it while giving to the poor, it is better for you, and He will atone for some of your sins. God is well aware of what you do","2:272":"It is not for you to guide them. God guides whomever He wills. What charity you give benefits you when you contribute only to please God. Your contributions will be paid back to you, and you will not be cheated","2:273":"Give to the poor who are wholly committed to the path of God and who are unable to travel in the land. The unaware considers them rich because of their self-restraint. You will recognize them by their character traits. They are not always asking people to help them. God knows what you contribute","2:274":"All those who contribute their money at night or during the day, both secretly and publicly, will receive a reward from their Lord. They will not be afraid, nor will they grieve","2:275":"Those who profit from usury will rise up on the Day of Resurrection like someone tormented by Satan's touch because they say, \"Selling is like usury, but God allowed selling and forbade usury.\" So whoever stops when receiving his Lord's good advice may keep what was previously his, and his matter is with God. Those who return to [usury] will eternally be in Hell","2:276":"God condemns usury, while He blesses and multiplies charitable transactions. God does not love any sinful person who denies the truth","2:277":"Those who believe and do righteous deeds and perform their prayers and give the purifying alms have their reward from their Lord, and they will not fear or grieve","2:278":"Believers, always be aware of God, and quit what remains of usury, if you are believers","2:279":"If you do not, then be warned of a war from God and his Messenger; and if you repent, you may have your original capital. Wrong not, and you will not be wronged","2:280":"However, if the borrower has financial difficulties, then defer payment until circumstances are better, and it would be for your own good, if you fully understood, to forgive the entire loan","2:281":"Beware of a day when you are returned to God and every soul will be paid in full for what it has earned, and none will be wronged","2:282":"Believers, if you become indebted to each other for a stated term, put it in writing. Let a legal clerk draw it up between you. The clerk should not refuse to write as God has taught him. The one who owes should dictate and always be mindful of God, his Lord. No amount should be withheld from him. If the one who owes is foolish, weak, or unable to dictate himself, let his legal guardian dictate and have it witnessed by two men, or, if there are not two, by one man and two women whom you approve as witnesses. If one of [the women] forgets, the other will remind her. Witnesses should not refuse when they are called upon. Do not think it unimportant to write it down, whether a small or large amount, along with its specified terms. That is more equitable to God, more reliable for testimony, and more likely to preclude doubt, except when it is a current business [that] you manage among yourselves. [In that case], not writing it down is not wrong. Always have witnesses present whenever you trade with one another, and do not let any harm be done to either the legal clerk or witnesses. If you do, you will be sinning. Be mindful of God, and God will teach you. God knows everything","2:283":"If you are on a trip and do not find a scribe, then an earnest payment should be paid. If you entrust things to each other, the one to whom it was entrusted should fulfill his pledge. He should be mindful of God, his Lord. Do not hide the testimony. Whoever hides it has a guilty heart. God knows what you do","2:284":"To God belongs what is in the heavens and the earth. Whether you reveal what is in your hearts or if you hide it, God will call you to account for it. He forgives whom he wills and punishes whom He wills. God has power over all things","2:285":"The Messenger believes in what was revealed to him by his Lord, as do the believers; they all believe in God, His angels, His Books and His Messengers.

To You is [our] destiny","2:286":"God does not burden a soul more than it can bear. It has [the good] it has earned, and [the evil] it has incurred. Our Lord, do not blame us if we forget or err.

God is severe in punishment","3:12":"Say to the unbelievers, \"You will be defeated and gathered into Hell - a dreadful suffering place","3:13":"You already have a sign: Two groups met [in battle], one fighting in God's cause and the other denying Him; with their own eyes the unbelievers saw the believers as double in numbers.\" God provides help to whomever He wills. That is a lesson for those who have eyes to see","3:14":"The love of worldly pleasures is alluring to people: women, children, vast hoards of gold and silver, branded horses, cattle, and farmland. These are matters of this world. God has the best of destinations","3:15":"Say, \"Will I tell you of better things than that? Those that were mindful of God will have Heavenly Gardens with their Lord, with flowing rivers.

They were asked to accept judgment according to God's Book, some of them being unreasonably stubborn, turned away","3:24":"just because they declared, \"We will only be in Hell for a few days.\" The lies they had fabricated caused them to betray their faith","3:25":"How then will they feel if we gather them for a definite day, when every soul is repaid as it deserves, and they will not be wronged","3:26":"Say, \"God, Lord of all dominion, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty from whom You will; You exalt whom You will, and You bring low whom You will.

He's from among the righteous","3:47":"She said, \"Lord, how can I have a boy when no man has ever touched me?\" He said, \"God creates what He wills, when He decides a matter, He simply says to it: \"Be!\", and then it is","3:48":"And He will teach him the Book, the Wisdom, the Torah, and the Gospel","3:49":"and he will be a messenger to the people of Israel, saying, \"I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I will create a bird like for you from clay and breathe into it and by God's permission it will be a bird.

God is infinite, All-knowing","3:74":"He singles out for His mercy whomever He wills, and God has boundless grace","3:75":"Some of the People of the Book you can trust with a lot of gold, and they will return it to you. If you give others of them merely one coin, they will not return it to you unless you constantly remind them.

God did not cheat them, but they cheated themselves","3:118":"Believers do not be close friends to outsiders who spare no effort to ruin you and want to see you suffer. Their hatred is apparent in what they say, and what their hearts hide is even worse.

We will give rewards in this world to whoever wants them, and rewards in the Hereafter to whoever wants them. We will reward those who give thanks","3:146":"Many prophets have fought with godly people by their side. They did not lose heart or weaken or surrender when suffering for God's cause. God loves those who endure","3:147":"What they said was, \"Lord, forgive us our sins and our over indulgences and make our feet firm, and save us from the unbelieving people","3:148":"So God gave them rewards in this world and best rewards in the life to come.

He showed you what you love, and then you failed, disputed and disobeyed. Some of you long for this world, and others long for the life to come.

They say, \"If we had a say about this we would not have been killed here.\" Say, \"If you were in your houses, those destined to be killed would have gone out to meet their death. God wants to test what is within you and purify what is in your hearts.

God sees well what you do","3:157":"If you die or are killed in God's path, there is forgiveness and mercy from God better than all the wealth one might accumulate","3:158":"When you die or are killed, you will be assembled before God","3:159":"By God's mercy, you [Prophet] were gentle toward them. If you had been rude and hard-hearted, they would have turned away from you. Pardon them, ask forgiveness for them, and consult them about the matter, but once you decide on a course of action, put your trust in God.

His dwelling is Hell, a dreadful destiny","3:163":"They are on different levels in the sight of God. God sees what they do","3:164":"God was gracious to the believers by sending them a messenger from among them reciting to them His verses, purifying them and teaching them the Book and Wisdom, though they were previously in clear error","3:165":"And when you are stricken with a disaster even after you have inflicted twice as much damage [on the enemy], you say, \"How can this be?\" Say, \"You brought this upon yourselves. God has power over all things","3:166":"What happened to you on the day when the two groups met was according to God's will, in order to give believers a chance to prove their faith","3:167":"and to let the hypocrites be known. When they were told \"Come fight in God's path or at least defend yourselves.\" They said, \"If we had known how to fight, we would have followed you.\" They were closer on that day to unbelief than they were to faith. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts. God knows what they hide","3:168":"As for those who remained behind, and said of their brothers, \"If they obeyed us, they would not have been killed.\" Say, \"Prevent death from reaching you, if you are telling the truth","3:169":"Never think of those who are killed in God's path as dead, but alive and provided for with their Lord","3:170":"rejoicing in what God has bestowed upon them of His favor, and they receive good news about those who remained behind who have not yet joined them - that there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve","3:171":"They are rejoicing in God's blessings and favor from God, and that God does not allow the believers' rewards to be lost","3:172":"Those who responded to God and his Messenger after suffering defeat, who do good and are mindful of God, will have a great reward","3:173":"Those who were told by others, \"People have gathered [an army] to fight you so fear them.\" This instead increased their faith, and they said, \"It is sufficient for us to be on God's side.

They will have great punishment","3:177":"Those who chose to deny God over faith will not harm God at all. They will have painful punishment","3:178":"Those who are adamantly denying God shouldn't think that granting them more time, is necessarily better for them. We give them more time, but they only increase their guilt. They will have shameful punishment","3:179":"God would not leave the believers in the state they are in, until He identifies the wicked from the sincere. Nor would God reveal to you His unseen plan, but God chooses messengers according to His will. So believe in God and his Messengers. If you believe and are mindful of God, you will have a great reward","3:180":"Those who are tightfisted with what God has given them out of His abundance must not think that it is good for them; in fact, it is terrible for them. Whatever they cruelly withhold will be hung around their necks on Resurrection Day. It is God who will inherit the heavens and the earth: God is well aware of all you do","3:181":"God has heard those who said, \"God is poor, and we are rich.\" We will write down what they said and their wrongful killing of the prophets in defiance of all that is right. We tell them, \"Experience the fire's punishment","3:182":"That is for what your hands have committed, because God is never unjust to his servants","3:183":"They are those who said that God has made a covenant with us not to believe in a messenger unless he brings us an offering that fire consumes. Say, \"Messengers before me have come to you with miracles including the one you mentioned, so why did you kill them if you are telling the truth","3:184":"And if they reject you, so also were messengers rejected who came before you, who brought miracles, written texts and the enlightening Book","3:185":"Every soul will experience death, and your true compensation will come on the Resurrection Day. The victor is he who is drawn away from Hell to enter the Heavenly Garden, for the life of this world is merely an illusion","3:186":"You will certainly be tested in your wealth and yourselves and will certainly hear hurtful things from those previously given the Book and the idolaters. But if you endure and are mindful of God, this proves the strength of your resolve","3:187":"God made a covenant with those who were given the Book, to clearly show it to humanity and not hide it, but they turned their backs on the covenant and bartered it for a small price. What an evil bargain they made","3:188":"Do not think that those who rejoice over what they were given and who love to be praised for what they did not do - do not think that they will escape from punishment. They will have agonizing punishment","3:189":"To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. God has power over all things","3:190":"The creation of the heavens and the earth and the sequence of night and day are signs to those who are endowed with insight","3:191":"They are those who remember God while standing and sitting and lying on their sides, and consider the creation of the heavens and the earth, saying \"Our Lord, you have not created this aimlessly.

Remain mindful of God, so you may prosper","4:1":"People, be mindful of your Lord, who created you out of a single soul, and out of it created its mate, and out of the two spread countless men and women. Remain mindful of God, in whose name you make requests of one another and beware of severing ties of kinship. God is always watching over you","4:2":"Give orphans their property, so do not replace [their] good things with bad, and do not intentionally mix their property into your own to consume it [for yourself]. This is a great sin","4:3":"If you fear that you will not be fair to the orphans, then you may marry two, three, or four, from among the orphans' mothers, if they seem good to you. However, if you fear that you may not be able to treat them with equal fairness, then marry only one or from those whom your right hands held in trust. This will make it more likely that you do not deviate from the right course","4:4":"Give women their bridal gift upon marriage, but if they decide to give you back a portion, then you may enjoy it with a good conscience","4:5":"Do not entrust to the incompetent any property of theirs for which God has made you responsible. Make provision for them from it, clothe them and speak to them in a kind way","4:6":"Mentor and train orphans until they reach marriageable age; then, if you find they are mature, hand over their possessions to them. Do not consume it wastefully or spend it before they come of age. If the guardian is rich, let him abstain [from charging fees]. But if he's poor, he should charge a fair fee. When you give them their property, call in witnesses, although God takes full account of everything you do","4:7":"Men will have a share in what their parents and close relatives leave behind, and women will have a share in what their parents and close relatives leave behind, whether it is a little or a lot: this is ordained by God","4:8":"If other relatives, orphans and poor people are present at the distribution [of inheritance], give them something as well, and speak to them in a kind way","4:9":"Let those who fear for the future of their own helpless children, if they were to die, show the same concern [for orphans].

When they have finished their prayer, let them take up their positions at the back while another group, who has not yet prayed, come forward to pray with you, also on their guard and armed with their weapons. The unbelievers would love to see you unarmed, so that they might take you in a surprise attack.

Those who disagree are confused, having no [real] knowledge to follow, only supposition. They certainly did not kill him","4:158":"Rather, God raised him up to Himself. God is Almighty and Wise","4:159":"Yet there is none among the People of the Book but will believe in him [Jesus] before his death. And on the Resurrection Day he [Jesus] will be a witness over them","4:160":"Due to the wrongdoings done by the Jews, We denied them certain good things that had been permitted to them previously; and [We did this] because they frequently turned away from God","4:161":"taking usury even though it had been forbidden them, and for wrongfully consuming other people's possessions. For those of them who continuously reject the truth, We have prepared painful punishment","4:162":"As for those among them who are deeply rooted in knowledge and the believers who believe in what has been revealed to you, and in what was revealed before you, and those who are [especially] constant in prayer, and give the purifying alms, and all who believe in God and the Last Day-- to them We will give a great reward","4:163":"We have sent a revelation to you [Prophet], just as We inspired Noah and all the prophets after him -- as We inspired Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and their descendants, including Jesus and Job, and Jonah, and Aaron, and Solomon; and to David We gave the Psalms","4:164":"and other messengers that We have already mentioned to you, as well as messengers that We have not mentioned to you. And God spoke directly to Moses","4:165":"All of these were messengers bearing good news and warning, so that people would not have any excuse before God after these messengers were sent. God is almighty and wise","4:166":"God [Himself] bears witness to what He has sent down to you: He sent it down from on high with His knowledge and with the angels bearing witness- although God is a sufficient witness","4:167":"Those who have denied the truth and turned others away from God's path have gone far astray","4:168":"God will not forgive those who reject the truth and are unjust, nor will He guide them onto any path","4:169":"except the path that leads to Hell, where they will live eternally. This is easy for God","4:170":"People, the Messenger has come to you with the Truth from your Lord, so believe it for your own wellbeing. If you deny the truth, remember that to God belongs everything that is in the heavens and on earth. God is All-Knowing and All-Wise","4:171":"People of the Book, do not be excessive in your beliefs, and do not say anything about God except the Truth. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, is the Messenger of God; His word conveyed to Mary and a spirit from Him. Believe in God and His Messengers and do not say \"Three.\" Stop this for your own good. God is only one God. So exalted is He, in His glory, from having a son. Everything belongs to Him that is in the heavens and on earth. None is as worthy to trust as He","4:172":"The Messiah was never too proud to be God's servant, nor were the angels who are near to Him. He will gather before Him the arrogant and all those who are too proud to worship Him","4:173":"To those who believe and do good deeds, He will give them their just rewards, and give them even more out of His favor. Whereas, to those who felt too proud and arrogant, He will punish them with a painful punishment. They will find no one to protect them from God","4:174":"People, convincing truth has now come to you from your Lord, and We have sent down to you clear enlightenment","4:175":"As for those who believe in Him, and hold fast to Him, God will admit them into His mercy and grace, and will guide them to Himself on a straight path","4:176":"They will ask you [Prophet] for a ruling. Say, \"God gives you a ruling concerning those who die childless and who have no surviving parents. If a man dies childless and has a sister, she will inherit one-half of what he has left, just as he will inherit from her if she dies childless. But if there are two sisters, then they are entitled to two-thirds of the inheritance between them, but if there are brothers and sisters, then the male is entitled to twice the share of the female.God makes this clear to you so that you do not go astray. God knows everything","5:1":"Believers, fulfill your obligations. Livestock animals are lawful for you to eat, except for what We will describe to you. You are not allowed to hunt while you are in a state of pilgrimage. God commands what He wills","5:2":"Believers, do not violate the laws pertaining to God's sacraments, the sacred month of pilgrimage, or the offerings, and do not prevent those who are going to the Sacred House from seeking favor, pleasure and acceptance from their Lord. Once your pilgrimage is over, then you are free to hunt. Never let your hatred for the people who barred you from the Sacred Sanctuary lead you to break the law. Help one another to do what is right-- to always be mindful of God, and do not encourage one another in sin and hostility. Always be mindful of God, because His punishment is severe","5:3":"You are forbidden to eat animals that you find already dead, blood, pork's meat, any animal over which any name other than God's has been invoked, any animal that has been strangled or beaten to death or killed by a fall or gored to death or mauled by a wild animal, unless you can still properly slaughter it. You are also forbidden to eat anything that has been sacrificed to idols. You are forbidden to draw lots, since this is sinful conduct. The unbelievers have lost all hope of you ever forsaking your faith. Do not be afraid of them, but stand in awe of Me. Today I have perfected your faith for you and have shed My grace upon you and have chosen submission [Islam] to be your faith. As for him who is driven to what is forbidden by dire necessity, and not by an inclination to sin, God is All-Forgiving and Merciful-to-all","5:4":"They will ask you [Prophet] what is lawful for them. Say, \"All good things are lawful to you, including what you have taught your birds and beasts of prey to catch, teaching them as God has taught you. You may eat what they catch for you, but invoke God's name over it, and always be mindful of God.\" He is quick to take account","5:5":"Today, all the good things of life have been made lawful for you. The food of the people of the Book is lawful to you just as your food is lawful to them. Virtuous, believing women are lawful to you as well as virtuous women from the People of the Book; provided that you give them their bridal gifts and marry them-- not taking them as lovers or secret mistresses. As for anyone who rejects faith in God, all of their works will come to nothing, and in the Hereafter they will be with the doomed","5:6":"Believers, when you are about to pray, wash your face, your hands and arms up to the elbows, and pass your wet hands lightly over your head and wash your feet up to the ankles. After sexual intercourse, purify yourselves. If you are ill, or are travelling, or have just relieved yourself, or have had intimate contact with a woman and cannot find water, then take some dust and use it to wipe your face and hands. God does not wish to place any burden on you, but wants to make you pure and to perfect His grace on you, so that you may be thankful","5:7":"Always remember God's grace on you and your pledge that binds you to Him when you said, \"We hear, and we obey.\" Always be mindful of God. God is fully aware of what is in your hearts","5:8":"Believers, always be steadfast in your devotion to God, equitably bearing witness to truth. Never let hatred for any people lead you to deviate from being just to them. Be just, for that is closer to being mindful of God. Always be mindful of God. God is well aware of what you do","5:9":"God has promised forgiveness and rich rewards to those who have faith and do good works","5:10":"whereas; those who deny Our revelations and lie are destined for the blazing fire","5:11":"Believers, remember how God favored you when certain people were about to attack you, and He protected you from them. Be always mindful of God. Let the believers put their trust in Him","5:12":"God took a pledge from the Children of Israel. We appointed twelve of them as leaders. And God said, \"I am with you. If you are regular in prayer, give the purifying alms, and believe in My Messengers and support them, and lend God a good loan, I will cleanse you of your bad deeds and admit you into Gardens with flowing rivers. After this, any of you who deny the truth will be far from the right path","5:13":"But, because they broke their pledge, We rejected them and hardened their hearts. They distorted the meaning of the revealed words, and they have forgotten a lot of what they have been told to remember. You will always find deceit in all but a few of them. Forgive them and forget. God loves those who honor Him by forgiving","5:14":"And We also took the pledge from those who say \"We are Christians,\" but they have forgotten part of what they were told to keep in mind. That caused resentment and hatred among them, which We have permitted until the Resurrection Day, when God will explain to them what they have done","5:15":"People of the Book, Our Messenger has come to you to clarify much of what you used to conceal of the Book and to overlook much. An enlightenment has now come to you from God and a clear Book","5:16":"Through it God guides those who follow what pleases Him to ways of peace and by His permission, He will bring them out from the darkness of ignorance into enlightenment, and will guide them to a straight path","5:17":"Those who say, \"God is the Messiah, the son of Mary,\" are defying the truth. Say, \"If it had been God's will, could anyone have prevented Him from destroying the Messiah, son of Mary, together with his mother and everyone else on earth?\" For God has control over the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He creates whatever He wants and has power over all things","5:18":"The Jews and the Christians say, \"We are God's children and His loved ones.\" Say to them, \"Why does He punish you for your sins? No, you are only human beings of His creation. He forgives whomever He wills, and He punishes whomever He wills, for God has control over the heavens and the earth and everything in between. All journeys lead to Him","5:19":"People of the Book, after a long time during which no messengers have appeared, Our Messenger comes to you now to make the truth clear to you so you should not say, \"No one has come to give us good news or to warn us.\" Someone did come to you to give you good news and to warn you. God has the power to do all things","5:20":"Moses said to his people, \"My people, remember God's blessing on you when He raised up prophets among you, and appointed kings for you and gave you what He had not given anyone else in the world","5:21":"My people, enter the holy land, which God has promised you; but do not turn back, or then you will be doomed","5:22":"They answered, \"Moses, there are ferocious people in this land. We will not enter it until they leave. If they leave, then we will enter","5:23":"Two men from among those who feared God, and whom God had blessed, said, \"Enter through the gate, for as soon as you enter, you will be victorious. If you are truly believers, you must place your trust in God","5:24":"They said, \"Moses, we will never enter while they are still there. Go forward with your Lord and fight, and we will stay here","5:25":"Moses said, \"Lord, I do not have control over anyone except my brother and myself. Judge between us and those defiantly disobedient people","5:26":"God said, \"The land is forbidden to them. They will wander aimlessly for forty years, on the earth. Do not grieve over those who disobey","5:27":"[Prophet] tell them the truth about the story of Adams' two sons-- how each of them offered a sacrifice, one sacrifice being accepted and the other being rejected. One said, \"I will kill you!\" The other replied, \"God only accepts the sacrifice of those who are mindful of Him","5:28":"Even if you try to kill me, I will not try to kill you. I fear God, the Lord of all the worlds","5:29":"I would rather you bear the burden of my sins as well as yours. Then you will be destined for the fire. That is the destiny of the unjust","5:30":"His selfishness caused him to murder his brother. He killed him and became doomed","5:31":"God sent a raven to scratch the ground to show him how to cover his brother's body. He cried out, \"How awful! Am I so helpless that I cannot do what this raven has done?\" He then buried his brother and was filled with sorrow","5:32":"Because of this, We decreed to the Children of Israel that if anyone kills a human being, unless it is in punishment for murder or for spreading corruption on earth, it will be as though he killed all of human beings. And, if anyone saves a life, it will be as though he had saved the lives of all human beings. Our Messengers came to them with evidence of the truth. Yet, many of them continued to corrupt earth by their over indulgence","5:33":"Those who wage war against God and His Messenger and strive to spread corruption on earth should be punished by death, crucifixion, the amputation of their hands and their feet, or should be entirely banished from [the face of] the earth. Such is their disgrace in this world. In the Hereafter, a terrible punishment awaits them","5:34":"except for those who repent before you overpower them. You must bear in mind that God is forgiving and Merciful-to-all","5:35":"Believers, remain mindful of God, seek ways to come closer to Him, and strive for His cause so that you may prosper","5:36":"If the unbelievers possess all that is on earth, and twice as much, and offer it to ransom themselves from suffering on the Resurrection Day, it will not be accepted from them: they will have a painful punishment","5:37":"They will wish to come out of the fire, but they will not come out of it. It will be an everlasting punishment","5:38":"As for the men and women who steal, cut off their hands as punishment for what they have done. It is a deterrent ordered by God. God is almighty and wise","5:39":"As for him who repents after having done wrong, and makes amends, God will accept his repentance. God is most forgiving and most Merciful-to-all","5:40":"Do you not know that control of the heavens and the earth belongs to God? He punishes whomever He wills, and He forgives whomever He wills. God has the power to do anything","5:41":"Messenger, do not be saddened by those who hurry to deny the truth; such as those who say, \"We believe,\" and do not have any faith in their hearts and the Jews who eagerly listen to any lies and to those who have never met you. They distort the meaning of the words, taking them out of their context, saying, \"If you have already been given this [in your Scriptures], accept it, but if you have not, then be on your guard!\" Do not be saddened by them, for if God wills someone to be tempted by evil, you will not be able to do anything for them.These are the ones whose hearts God is not willing to cleanse. They will be disgraced in this world, and will have terrible suffering in the Hereafter","5:42":"They eagerly listen to lies and greedily profit from all that is evil. If they come to you [Prophet] for judgment, you can either judge between them or decline, for if you decline, they cannot harm you in any way. If you do judge, judge them fairly: God loves the just","5:43":"Why do they come to you for judgment, seeing that they have the Torah with God's Law? Even then they will turn away from your judgment. These are not true believers","5:44":"We revealed the Torah with guidance and enlightenment. The prophets, who had submitted themselves to God, as well as the rabbis and the scholars, all judged according to that part of God's Book they were entrusted to preserve and to which they were witnesses. So do not fear people. Only fear Me. Do not barter my verses for a small profit. Those who do not judge according to what God has revealed are unbelievers","5:45":"In the Torah we prescribed for them a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and a similar retribution for wounds. However, If anyone forgoes this out of charity, it will serve as atonement for them. Those who do not judge in accordance with what God has revealed are unjust","5:46":"We sent Jesus, the son of Mary, to follow in the footsteps of those earlier prophets, confirming what was available of the Torah. We gave him the Gospel. It has guidance and enlightenment, confirming what was available of the Torah. It has guidance and an admonition for those who are mindful of God","5:47":"Let the followers of the Gospel judge according to what God has revealed in it. Those who do not judge in light of what God has revealed are deviators","5:48":"[Prophet] We sent you the Book, setting forth the Truth, confirming what is available of earlier revelations and with final authority over them. Judge between them in accordance with what God has sent down. Do not follow their whims, which deviate from the Truth revealed to you.We have assigned to each of you a law and a way of life. If God had wanted, He could have made all of you a single community, but instead He is testing you by means of what He has revealed to you. So compete in doing what is good. You will all return to God, and He will clarify these matters about which you have differed","5:49":"[Prophet] Judge between them according to what God has revealed to them, and do not follow their whims. Be cautious. Do not let them tempt you away from what God has revealed to you. If they turn away, remember it is God's will to repay them for some of the sins they have committed. A great many people are deviators","5:50":"Do they want judgment according to the age of ignorance? Is there any better judge than God for those who are firm in faith","5:51":"Believers, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies. They are only allies with one another, and whoever allies himself with them becomes one of them. God does not guide such unjust people","5:52":"You [Prophet] will see those with perverse hearts rushing to them and saying, \"We are afraid that fortune may turn against us.\" God may bring about good fortune for the believers, or He may not. Then they will be overcome with remorse for the thoughts that they secretly harbored","5:53":"The believers will say to one another, \"Are these the same men who swore by God with their most solemn oath that they were with you? All they did was in vain, and they lost everything","5:54":"Believers, if you ever abandon your faith, God will replace you with people He loves and who love Him, people who are meek toward the believers, uncompromising to the unbelievers; people who strive hard in God's cause, and do not fear being blamed by anyone. Such is God's grace, which He grants to whomever He wills. God has boundless grace and knowledge","5:55":"Your true allies are God, His Messenger and the believers-- those who are constant in prayer, pay the prescribed purifying alms, and bow down in worship","5:56":"All who ally themselves with God and His Messenger and the believers will be victorious","5:57":"Believers, do not befriend people who mock your faith and make fun of it, whether they are people who were given the Book before you or who are unbelievers. Remain mindful of God if you are truly believers","5:58":"When you make a call to prayer, they mock it and make fun of it because they are people who do not use reason","5:59":"Say, \"People of the Book, do you resent us for any reason other than that we believe in God and what He has revealed to us and what He revealed before us, or is it only because most of you are deviators","5:60":"Say, \"Will I tell you, in the sight of God, who deserves a worse punishment than these? They whom God has rejected and whom He condemned and turned into apes and pigs because they worshipped the powers of evil. They are worse in rank and farther astray from the right path","5:61":"When they come to you, they say, \"We believe.\" However, they come denying the truth and leave in the same state. God is fully aware of all they conceal","5:62":"You [Prophet] can see many of them outdoing one another in sin and hostility and making illegal profits","5:63":"If only their rabbis and scholars would stop them from speaking sinfully and making illegal profits. Their deeds are so evil","5:64":"Those Jews said, \"God hands are tied!\" It is they whose hands are tied! They are cursed by God for what they have said. God's hands are open wide; He gives as He pleases. What has been sent down to you [Prophet] from your Lord is sure to make many of them even more stubborn in their arrogance and in their denial of the truth.We have incited enmity and hatred among the People of the Book until the Resurrection Day. Whenever they kindle the fires of war, God extinguishes them and they work hard at spreading corruption on earth. God does not love the corrupters","5:65":"If the People of the Book would only truly believe and be mindful of God! We would wipe away their former evil deeds and bring them into Gardens of delight","5:66":"and if they would truly observe the Torah and the Gospel and all that has been revealed to them by their Lord, they would have been given an abundance of grace from heaven and earth. Some of them are on the right course, but most of them do what is evil","5:67":"Prophet, proclaim everything that has been sent down to you from your Lord, for unless you do it fully, you will not have delivered His message. God will protect you from men. God does not guide people who refuse to acknowledge the truth","5:68":"Say, \"People of the Book, You have no valid ground for your beliefs, unless you [truly] observe the Torah and the Gospel, and all that has been sent down to you from your Lord.\" Yet all that has been sent down to you [Prophet] by your Lord is bound to make many of them more stubborn in their arrogance and in their denial of the truth. Do not worry about unbelievers","5:69":"The believers, as well as the Jews, the Sabeans and the Christians: all who believe in God and the Last Day and do righteous deeds, will have nothing to fear and they will not grieve","5:70":"We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, and We sent messengers to them. Every time a messenger came to them with anything that was not to their liking, they rebelled. They accused some of them of lying and killed others","5:71":"Thinking that they themselves would not be harmed, they became blind and deaf. God turned to them in mercy, yet many of them again became blind and deaf. God sees everything that they do","5:72":"Those who say, \"God is the Messiah, son of Mary,\" have defied God. The Messiah himself said, \"Children of Israel, worship God. He is my Lord as well as your Lord.\" If anyone associated others with God, He will not permit them to enter Heaven. Their destiny will be Hell. No one can help such unjust people","5:73":"Those who say, \"God is the third of a trinity\" are denying the truth because there is only One God. Unless they stop saying this, a painful punishment will happen to those of them who are determined to deny the truth","5:74":"Why do they not turn towards God in repentance and ask for His forgiveness? God is most forgiving and Merciful-to-all","5:75":"The Messiah, son of Mary, was only a messenger. All [other] messengers had passed away before him, and his mother was one who never deviated from the truth. They both ate food. See how clear We make these messages for them and how deluded their minds are","5:76":"Say, \"How can you worship something other than God that has no power to harm or to benefit you when God alone is All-Hearing, All-Knowing","5:77":"Say, \"People of the Book, do not overstep the bounds of Truth in your religious beliefs. Do not follow the whims of the people who went astray before you. They have led many others astray, and they continue to stray from the right path","5:78":"Those of the Children of Israel who defied God and denied the truth, have been cursed and rejected by the words of David and Jesus, the son of Mary, because they rebelled and persistently overstepped the limits","5:79":"They did not prevent each other from doing hateful things. Their deeds were so evil","5:80":"You [Prophet] see many of them allying themselves with the unbelievers. How evil is what their souls make them do! God has condemned them, and they will remain in punishment forever","5:81":"If they [truly] believed in God and their Prophet and all that was sent down to them, they would not take the unbelievers for their allies: but most of them are defiant","5:82":"You [Prophet] are sure to find that the most hostile to the believers are the Jews as well as those who are bent on ascribing partners to God. While, you will find that the nearest in affection towards the believers are those who say, \"We are Christians,\" because there are priests and monks among them, and because these people are not given to arrogance","5:83":"For, when they understand what has come down to this messenger, you can see their eyes tear up because they recognize the Truth in it, and they say, \"Lord, we do believe. Make us one with all who bear witness to the Truth","5:84":"How could we fail to believe in God and in the Truth that has come to us when we long that our Lord include us in the company of the righteous","5:85":"For saying this, God will reward them with Heavenly Gardens with flowing rivers where they will permanently abide, for this is the reward for those who do good","5:86":"Whereas, those who reject the truth and deny Our messages are destined for the blazing fire","5:87":"Believers, do not deprive yourselves of good things in life which God has made lawful to you, but do not exceed the limits of what is right. God does not love those who exceed the limits of what is right","5:88":"Partake of the lawful and good things which God has provided for you and be mindful of God in Whom you believe","5:89":"God does not hold you accountable for oaths thoughtlessly sworn, but He will take you to task for earnestly sworn oaths. So, the breaking of an oath must be atoned by feeding ten needy persons with the same food as you would want for your own family, or by clothing them, or by freeing a slave, and if a person cannot find the means to do this, he will fast for three days. This will be the atonement for your oaths whenever you have sworn [and broken them]. Be careful with your oaths. God makes His messages clear to you, so that you may be grateful","5:90":"Believers, intoxicants, gambling, idolatry, and fortunetelling are repugnant and evil acts. They are evil acts of Satan. Avoid them so that you may prosper","5:91":"With intoxicants and gambling, Satan only seeks to incite hostility and hatred among you, and to turn you away from remembering God and from prayer. Will you not give them up","5:92":"Obey God and obey the Messenger, and always be careful! If you pay no attention, know that Our Messenger's only duty is to clearly transmit the message","5:93":"Those who believe and do righteous deeds incur no sin for what they may have participated in, so long as they are mindful of God and believe and do righteous deeds, and continue to be mindful of God and to believe and grow ever more mindful of God and persevere in doing good: God loves those who do good deeds","5:94":"Believers, God is sure to tempt you with wild games that come, within reach of your hands and weapons, so He can identify those who fear Him, even though they think He is not watching. Whoever oversteps the limits, will have a painful punishment","5:95":"Believers, do not hunt while you are in the state for sanctity. Whoever kills an animal intentionally must make amends by offering an equivalent domestic animal comparable to what was killed as defined by two just men-an offering to be delivered to the Ka'bah. Or, he may atone for his sin by feeding the needy, or by fasting an equivalent number of days, so that he may understand the seriousness of what he has done. God forgives what is past, but if anyone does it again, God will punish him severely. God is mighty, and capable of exacting the penalty","5:96":"It is permitted for you to catch and eat seafood. This is an enjoyment for you as well as for travelers, although you are forbidden to hunt on land while you are in the state of sanctity. Be mindful of God to whom you will be gathered","5:97":"God has made the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, a sanctuary for human beings, and the Sacred Months, the animals for sacrifice and their garlands, so that you will be aware that God has knowledge about all that is in the heavens and the earth. God knows about everything","5:98":"Know that God is severe in His punishment, and yet He is most forgiving and Merciful-to-all","5:99":"The Messenger only has a duty to deliver the message, as God knows what you reveal and what you hide","5:100":"Say [Prophet], \"The bad and the good are not equal, even though many of the bad things may greatly please you. People of understanding, be mindful of God so that you may prosper","5:101":"Believers, do not ask about matters that would trouble you if disclosed to you. But, if you ask about them while the Qur'an is being revealed, they will be made known to you. God has absolved [you from any obligation] in this respect. God is most forgiving and longsuffering","5:102":"People before your time have asked such questions, then later they rejected the answers","5:103":"God has not ordained that certain kinds of cattle should be designated Bahirah, Saibah, Wasilah, or of Hami, and set aside from the use of man, yet the unbelievers invent lies about God. Most of them do not use reason","5:104":"When they are told, \"Accept what God has sent down and the Messenger,\" they answer, \"What we inherited from our forefathers is enough for us.\" Their forefathers knew nothing and were not guided","5:105":"Believers, you are responsible for your own souls; those who go astray cannot harm you if you are on the right path. All of you will return to God, and He will tell you what you used to do","5:106":"Believers, when death approaches you, let two just men from among you act as witnesses to the writing of your will. If death approaches you while you are travelling far from home, let two just men from among another people act as witnesses. Take hold of the two men after having prayed and, if you have any doubt in your mind, let each of them swear to God, \"We will not sell our word for any price, even if it were for the sake of a near relative. We will not hide God's testimony, or else We will be counted among the sinful","5:107":"If It is discovered that these two are guilty of this sin, then two of those whose rights have been usurped have a better right to bear witness. Let them swear to God, \"Our testimony is truer than the testimony of those two, and we have not committed perjury, because that would make us unjust","5:108":"It will be more likely that people will offer the truth in their testimony because they will be afraid that others might refute their oaths. Remain mindful of God and listen. God does not guide those who are defiantly disobedient","5:109":"On the Day when God assembles all the messengers and asks, \"What response did you receive?\" They will answer, \"We have no knowledge. You alone know these things that cannot be seen","5:110":"God will say, \"Jesus, son of Mary, remember the grace which I bestowed upon you and your mother? How I strengthened you with the Holy Spirit so you could speak from your cradle, and as a grown man? [Remember] when I taught you the Book, the Wisdom, the Torah and the Gospel? [Remember] when, with My permission, you fashioned the shape of a bird out of clay, breathed into it, and it became, with My permission, a bird? [Remember] when, with My permission, you healed the blind person and the leper; when, by My permission, you brought the dead back to life? [Remember] when I kept the Children of Israel from harming you when you came to them with all the evidence of the truth, and when those of them who were bent on denying the truth said, \"This is clearly nothing but deception","5:111":"And [mention] when I inspired the disciples to believe in Me and My Messenger? They answered, \"We believe and bear witness that we submit ourselves to You","5:112":"And [mention] when the disciples said, \"Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord send us a feast from heaven?\" [Jesus] answered, \"Remain mindful of God, if you are [truly] believers","5:113":"They said, \"We wish to eat from it so that our hearts might be reassured and that we might know that you have told us the truth and be among those who witness it","5:114":"Jesus, the son of Mary, said, \"God, our Lord, send us a meal from heaven so that we can have a recurring celebration for the first and the last of us, and a sign from You.

Those who do such wrong will not prosper","6:22":"One Day We will gather them all together and say to the idolaters, \"Where are those beings you imagined to be partners with God","6:23":"In their utter confusion, they will only say, \"By God, our Lord, we did not mean to associate partners with Him","6:24":"See how they have lied to themselves and how the gods they invented have abandoned them","6:25":"Among them are some who [appear] to listen to your [message, Prophet], but We have laid covers over their hearts and deafness in their ears which prevent them from grasping the truth. Even if they saw every sign, they would still not believe it. When they come to you, they argue with you. The unbelievers say, \"These are nothing but fairy tales","6:26":"They tell others not to listen, while they stay away. They destroy no one but themselves, though they fail to realize this","6:27":"If you could only see them when they will have to stand before the fire and say, \"If only we were brought back, we would not reject the revelations of our Lord, but would be among the believers","6:28":"The truth they used to conceal will become obvious to them, and if they were brought back, they would return to the very thing that was forbidden to them.

However, this is a reminder to them so that they may become mindful of God","6:70":"Leave behind those who turn their religion into amusement and a diversion and are mesmerized by the life of this world. Remind them with it, lest a soul be damned for what it has earned. It will have no one to protect it from God, and no one to intercede besides Him. Whatever ransom he may offer will not be accepted. Such people will be held accountable for their actions. For them will be a drink of boiling water, and painful punishment awaits them because of their persistence in denying the truth","6:71":"Say, \"Instead of God, will we call on something that can neither benefit nor harm us, and turn back after God has guided us.

I see that you and your people are clearly lost","6:75":"In this way We made Abraham to understand God's mighty dominion over the heavens and the earth, so that he might become a firm believer","6:76":"When the night overshadowed him, he saw a star and said, \"This is my Lord!\" But when it went down he said, \"I do not like things that disappear","6:77":"Then, when he saw the moon rising he said, \"This is my Lord\" but when it set, he said, \"If my Lord does not guide me, I will definitely become one of those lost people","6:78":"Then, when he saw the sun rising he said, \"This is my Lord! This is greater!\" But when it [too] set, he said, \"My people, I disown all that you worship other than God","6:79":"I have turned my face to Him who brought into existence the heavens and the earth, and I have turned away from all that is false. I am not one of the idolaters","6:80":"His people argued with him, and he said, \"How can you argue with me about God when it is He who has guided me? I do not fear anything you associate with Him [for no evil can affect me] unless my Lord so wills. My Lord embraces everything within His knowledge.

Tell me, if you know the answer, which side is more entitled to feel secure","6:82":"It is those who have faith, and who have not mixed their faith with idolatry. It is they who will be secure, since it is they who have found the right path","6:83":"Such was the argument We gave to Abraham against his people. We raise in rank whoever We will. Your Lord is All-Wise, All-knowing","6:84":"We gave him Isaac and Jacob. We guided each just as We had guided Noah before. Among his descendants were David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. In this way We reward those who do good","6:85":"Zachariah, John, Jesus and Elijah-- every one of them was righteous","6:86":"Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah, and Lot--We favored every one of them above other people","6:87":"and also some of their forefathers, their offspring and their brothers. We chose them and guided them on a straight path","6:88":"Such is God's guidance. He guides whomever He wills of his worshipers. Had they ascribed divinity to others besides Him, all their good works would have been in vain","6:89":"Those are the ones to whom We gave the Book, wisdom and prophethood. Even if these people now chose to deny the truth, We will entrust it to others who will never deny the truth","6:90":"These were the people God guided. Follow their guidance and say, \"I ask no reward for it from you. It is a reminder to all people","6:91":"They had not truly appreciated God when they said; God has never revealed anything to a mortal.\" Say, \"Who was it then that sent down the Book which Moses brought as a enlightenment and guidance to men--Yet, you treat it as [mere] leaves of paper, showing some but hiding many. You were taught things that neither you nor your forefathers had ever known. Say, \"God!\" [has revealed the Book] Then leave them engrossed in their vain talk","6:92":"This is a blessed Book that We sent down to confirm what is available (of earlier revelations] in order that you may warn the foremost of cities and its surroundings. Those who believe in the Hereafter believe it [this Book] and keep their prayers","6:93":"Who could be more wicked than someone who invents lies about God or says, \"This has been revealed to me,\" when no revelations have been sent to him, or says, \"I can also reveal something equal to God's revelation?\" If you could only see [how it will be] when these evildoers find themselves in the agonies of death, and the angels stretch out their hands to them [and call], \"Give up your souls. Today you will be repaid with humiliating suffering for attributing something to God that is not true and for arrogantly resisting His Message","6:94":"God will say, \"Now you returned to Us alone, just as We first created you, and you have left behind all that We gave you [in your lifetime]. We don't see those intercessors of yours that you claimed were partners with God. All the bonds between you [and your earthly life] are now severed, and all those you formerly fancied have deserted you","6:95":"God is the One who splits the grain, and the seeds open. He brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living. This is God, so how can you turn away from the truth","6:96":"He causes dawns to break, and He makes the night for rest, and He made the sun and the moon run precise courses. That is the design of the Almighty, the All-Knowing","6:97":"It is He who set up the stars for you so that you might be guided by them in the midst of the deep darkness of the land and the sea. We have spelled out these messages for those who have knowledge","6:98":"It is He who brought you [all] into existence from a single soul and [has appoint each of you] a time-limit [on earth] and a resting place [after death]. We have made Our revelations clear to those who comprehend","6:99":"It is He who sends down water from the sky. With it, We sustain all living growth, then bring greenery from it, and from that We bring out grains, one riding on the other in close-packed rows.From the palm tree comes dates in thick clusters, and there are gardens of vines and olive trees, and pomegranates, all so alike and yet so different. Watch their fruit while it ripens. In all this there are signs for the people who would believe","6:100":"Some [people] have come to think of jinn as partners with God, although it is He who has created them, and in their ignorance they attribute sons and daughters to Him. May he be exalted in His glory and far higher than anything that men may ascribe to Him","6:101":"the Originator of the heavens and earth. How could He have had a child without ever having a mate, since It is He who created everything, and He alone knows everything","6:102":"This is God, your Lord, and there is no God but Him, the Creator of everything. Worship Him alone. He is in charge of everything","6:103":"No human vision perceives Him, whereas He perceives all they see.

We have not made you their keeper, and neither are you responsible for their conduct","6:108":"Don't insult those they worship other than God, lest in their hostility and ignorance, [they) insult God. Thus We made their deeds seem pleasing to each community, but in the end, they must return to their Lord and then He will make them [truly] understand all that they were doing","6:109":"They swear by God with their most solemn oaths that if a miracle were to be shown to them, they would believe in this Book. Say, \"Miracles are up to God alone.\" And, for all you know, even if a miracle were shown to them, they would not believe","6:110":"We will keep their hearts and their eyes turning. Just as they did not believe in the first place, We will leave them in their overwhelming arrogance, stumbling blindly","6:111":"Even if We send angels to them, and if the dead were to speak to them and We were to assemble before them, face to face, all the things that were ever created, they would still not believe in God unless God so willed, but most of them are ignorant","6:112":"Thus, We assigned evil humans and evil jinn as enemies to every prophet. They whisper enticing words to one another in order to deceive. But they cannot do this unless your Lord had so willed. Therefore, desert them and their invented lies","6:113":"so that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline towards their deceit, being content to continue doing whatever they are doing","6:114":"[Say], \"Will I seek any judge other than God, when It is He who has sent down the Book, clearly spelling out the truth?\" Those to whom We gave the Book before know that this is revealed by your Lord with the Truth.

He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing","6:116":"If you obeyed the majority of those on earth, they will lead you away from the path of God. They follow nothing but speculation, and they are merely guessing","6:117":"Your Lord knows best who strays from his path and who is rightly-guided","6:118":"[Believers] eat any [meat] over which God's name has been pronounced, if you truly believe in His messages","6:119":"Why not eat that over which God's name has been pronounced, knowing that He has clearly spelled out to you what He has forbidden you to eat, and even that you may eat if you are compelled to do so? But many mislead others through their whims, even though they do not really know. Your Lord, however, is fully aware of these transgressors","6:120":"Abstain from sins, openly or in secret. Those who commit sins will be punished for all they have committed","6:121":"Do not eat that over which God's name has not been pronounced, for this would be sinful conduct. The devils incite their followers to argue with you and if you listen to them, you, too, will become one of those idolaters","6:122":"Is a dead person whom We brought back to life and given enlightenment so that he might see his way among men, comparable to someone who is lost in deep darkness from which he cannot emerge? This is how it is. The evil deeds of the unbelievers are made to seem enticing to them","6:123":"so We placed the greatest opponents in every town to execute their schemes, but they only scheme against themselves without realizing it","6:124":"Whenever a revelation comes to them, they say, \"We will not believe unless we are given the same revelation as God's Messengers were given.\" God knows best where to place His messages. Humiliation before God and severe punishment will befall those who are guilty of opposition through their schemes","6:125":"When God wishes to guide someone, He opens his heart to surrender to Him [Islam]. And whomever He wills to let go astray, He tightens and constricts his chest, as if he were ascending up to the sky.

You should know that God is with those who are mindful of Him","9:37":"Postponing sacred months is an increase in the rejection of the truth, a means by which those rejecters are further mislead. They declare it lawful one year and unlawful the next, in order to correspond to the number of month made unlawful by God. They allow what God has forbidden. They are enticed by their own sins. God does not guide people who refuse to acknowledge the truth","9:38":"Believers, what is the matter with you? When you are told to march forth to war in God's cause, you continue to cling to the earth. Are you content with this present life to the point that you prefer it to the life to come? The enjoyment of the present life is practically nothing in comparison to the life to come","9:39":"If you do not go forth [to fight], He will punish you severely and will replace you with others, [although] you will not bother Him at all. God is able to do all things","9:40":"[It does not matter] if you do not support the Messenger, [since] God already supported him when the unbelievers expelled him. He was one of two men hiding in a cave, and he said to his companion, \"Do not be panic, God is with us.\" Then God sent His peace down on him and supported him with forces that were invisible to you. He made the unbelievers' word the lowest and God's word supreme. God is Almighty and All-Wise","9:41":"March forth, whether young or old, and commit your possessions and your lives to God's cause; if only you knew how much this is for your own good","9:42":"Had there been immediate profit and an easy journey, they would have followed you. But the distance was too far for them. Later, they will swear by God, \"Had we been able, we would surely have marched with you.\" They will be damning their own souls. God knows they are liars","9:43":"God forgives you [Prophet] for permitting them to stay behind before it was obvious which of them were truthful and which were liars","9:44":"Those who believe in God and the Last Day do not ask you for exemption from committing their possessions and their lives to the struggle. God knows who is mindful of Him","9:45":"Only those who do not believe in God and the Last Day ask you for exemption. Their hearts are full of doubts, and they are hesitant","9:46":"If they had truly wanted to march with you, they would have prepared. [But, knowing what was in their hearts,] God hated for them to join, so He held them back, and they were told, \"Stay behind with those who remain","9:47":"Had they gone with you, they would have only made things more difficult. They would have spread rumors, causing divisions, because some of you are avid listeners to them. God knows exactly who the transgressors are","9:48":"They tried before to create conflict and hatch plots against you, until the Truth was revealed and God's command became evident, even though they despised it","9:49":"Some of them said, \"Grant me leave and do not cause me to doubt.\" They were already doubting. Hell will always be ready to embrace those who refuse to believe","9:50":"If anything good happens to you, it will grieve them, and, should you have misfortune, they will say: \"We knew it, and that is why we took precaution.\" They will turn away in delight","9:51":"Say, \"Only what God has decreed will happen to us. He is our Supreme Lord. Let the believers place their trust in God","9:52":"Say, \"Do you expect something other than one of the two glorious rewards (victory or death in God's cause] to be ours? We, too, are waiting to see whether your punishment will come directly from God or at our hands. Wait, then; we wait with you","9:53":"Say, \"You may give [your contribution] willingly or unwillingly, but it will never be accepted from you. You are disobedient people","9:54":"The only thing that prevents their giving from being accepted is their refusal to acknowledge God and His Messenger. They never pray without reluctance, and they never spend without resentment","9:55":"Do not let their worldly goods or their children impress you. God intends to punish them with it in this world, and for their souls to depart while they are still unbelievers","9:56":"They swear to God that they are part of you, but they are not. They are petrified","9:57":"and, if they could find a place of refuge, or a cave, or something to crawl into, they would run towards it quickly","9:58":"Some of them criticize you concerning the distribution of charitable gifts. They are content if they are given something, and they are very angry if they are given nothing","9:59":"If only they had been satisfied with what God and His Messenger gave them and said, \"God is enough for us. We trust that God will give us out of His bounty, and so will His Messenger. We turn to God alone, with hope","9:60":"The purifying alms funds are meant only for the poor and the needy, for those who administer the fund, for reconciling hearts, for freeing slaves, for helping those in debt to spend in God's cause, and for travelers in need. This is ordered by God. God is All-Knowing and All-Wise","9:61":"There are others who insult the Prophet by saying, \"He will listen to anything.\" Say, \"He listens for your own good. He believes in God and trusts the Believers, and he is a mercy to those of you who believe.\" And those who abuse the Messenger of God, will have a painful punishment","9:62":"They swear by God, hoping to please you, but it is proper for them to please God and His Messenger, if they are Believers","9:63":"Did they not know that whoever opposes God and His Messenger will go to the fire of Hell [and] remain there forever? This is the greatest disgrace","9:64":"The hypocrites fear lest a chapter be revealed that will expose what is in their hearts. Say, \"Mock all you want. God will bring about what you fear","9:65":"If you were to question them, they would surely answer, \"We were just joking and having fun.\" Say, \"Is it God, His messages and His Messenger that you were joking about","9:66":"Do not offer excuses. You have denied the truth after believing.\" Even though We may forgive some of you, We will punish others because they were guilty","9:67":"The hypocrites, both men and women, are all the same: they ordain what is wrong and forbid what is right. They are tight fisted. They have forgotten God, and so He has forgotten them. They are defiantly disobedient","9:68":"God has promised both the hypocrites-men and women-[and] the unbelievers the fire of Hell, where they will stay forever. This is sufficient for them. God has rejected them, and ever-lasting suffering awaits them","9:69":"[Unbelievers] you are just like your predecessors. They were more powerful than you and had more wealth and children. They enjoyed their share of worldly pleasures, just as you have been enjoying yours. You are as indulgent as they were. It is those people whose works became worthless in this world and in the Hereafter, and it is they who are the losers","9:70":"Have they not heard the stories of those who came before them? Noah's people, Ad's and Thamud's, Abraham's people, Midian's inhabitants, and the people of the destroyed towns. Their messengers came to them with clear evidence of the truth, and so it was not God Who was unfair to them, but they were unfair to themselves","9:71":"The believers, both men and women, support each other; they order what is obviously right and forbid what is obviously wrong, and they perform prayers, pay the prescribed purifying alms, and obey God and His Messenger. God will have mercy on them. He is Almighty and All-Wise","9:72":"God has promised the believers, men and women, Gardens with flowing rivers and nice homes in Gardens of Eden. But the greatest pleasure is God's continuous approval of them. That is the ultimate victory","9:73":"Prophet, struggle hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be tough with them. If they do not repent, their final home will be Hell, a miserable destination","9:74":"The hypocrites swear by God that they have said nothing wrong, but they have definitely uttered words of blasphemy and become unbelievers after having submitted. They plotted that which was beyond their ability. They resented that God and His Messenger had enriched them out of His favor. If they repent, it would be for their own good, but if they turn away, God will cause them to suffer painfully in this world and in the life to come, and no one on earth will be able to help or protect them","9:75":"Some among them pledged to God, \"If He give us out of His bounty, We will definitely spend on charity and will be among the righteous","9:76":"but when He gave them out of His bounty, they were stingy with it and defiantly turned away","9:77":"Because of their failure to fulfill their pledge to Him, and because of the lies they told, He caused hypocrisy to overtake their hearts until the Day they will meet Him","9:78":"Do they not know that God knows all their secrets and their private conversations and that God is most knowing of everything that is beyond their perception","9:79":"They criticize the believers who voluntarily contribute, and ridicule the ones who had nothing to give except their own efforts. Instead, God ridicules them, and a painful punishment awaits them","9:80":"Praying or not praying for their forgiveness will make no difference. Even if you were to pray seventy times for their forgiveness, God will not forgive them because they reject God and His Messenger. God does not guide those who are defiantly disobedient people","9:81":"After God's Messenger had left, those who remained behind were glad, because they hated to strive in God's way with their possessions and their lives. They had even said, \"Do not go to war in this heat.\" Say, \"The fire of Hell is a lot hotter!\" If they could only understand","9:82":"Let them laugh a little because they will weep a lot in return for what they have earned","9:83":"So, [Prophet,] if God brings you face to face with them again, and they should ask you for permission to go to war with you, say, \"You will never come with me, nor will you fight an enemy with me. You were happy to stay at home the first time, so, stay at home now with those who remain behind","9:84":"Do not ever pray over any of them who died, and do not stand at their graves; they rejected God and His Messenger, and they died defiantly disobedient","9:85":"Do not let their worldly possessions and their children impress you. God wants to use such things to punish them in this world, and for their souls to depart in anguish while they are still denying the truth","9:86":"When a new revelation is given asking them to believe in God and to strive hard alongside His Messenger, even those of them with means ask your permission to stay, saying \"Allow us to stay with those who remain at home","9:87":"They were happy to remain with those who were left behind, because their hearts have been sealed, and they do not understand","9:88":"However, the Messenger and all who share his faith strive hard in God's cause with their possessions and their lives, and great things await them in the life to come. It is they who will prosper","9:89":"God has prepared Gardens with rivers flowing through them. There, they will remain eternally. This is the ultimate victory","9:90":"Some of the Bedouins, too, came [to the Messenger] to make excuses, asking to be granted exemption. Those who lied to God and His Messenger stayed behind at home. A painful punishment will fall on those who rejected faith","9:91":"No blame will be placed on the weak, or the sick, or those who have no means to equip themselves, provided that they are sincere towards God and His Messenger. In no way the righteous should be blamed. God is most forgiving and Merciful-to-all","9:92":"Blame will not be placed on those who come to you [Prophet, with the request] that you provide them with riding animals, and to whom you say, \"I do not have rides for you.\" They turned away with their eyes overflowing with tears out of sorrow that they had nothing they could contribute","9:93":"The ones to be blamed are those wealthy [persons] who asked you for an exemption. They are happy to remain with those who are left behind. God has sealed their hearts and they don't realize it","9:94":"They will offer you excuses when you return. Say, \"Do not give us any excuses, we will not believe you. God has already told us about you. God will be watching your deeds, and so will His Messenger, and, in the end, you will be brought before Him the Knower of the unknown and the known. He will make you truly understand [the negative impact of] what you were doing","9:95":"[Believers], when you return to them, they will swear by God in order to make you leave them alone. Leave them alone. They are despicable, and their destiny is Hell, fit payment for their actions","9:96":"They will swear to you to in order to make you accept them. God will never accept those who are defiantly disobedient","9:97":"The Bedouins are the most hypocritical and stubborn in [their] rejection of faith and the least likely to comprehend the limits [of laws] that God has sent down to His Messenger. God knows everything, and He is wise","9:98":"Among the Bedouins, there are some who consider what they spend [in God's cause] to be a loss and expect that you will run into trouble, but it is they who will be overwhelmed by trouble. God hears everything and knows everything","9:99":"Yet, there are also Bedouins who believe in God and the Last Day and regard everything they spend [in God's cause] to be means of drawing them closer to God and the Messenger's prayers. It will definitely bring them nearer to God, admitting them to His mercy. God is forgiving and Merciful-to-all","9:100":"It is the first of the early emigrants and supporters, as well as those who followed them in righteousness, with whom God is very pleased, and they are pleased with Him. He has prepared Gardens with flowing rivers for them, where they will stay forever. This is the ultimate victory","9:101":"Among the Bedouins who live around you, some are hypocrites, as are some of the people of Medina, who have grown accustomed to hypocrisy. You do not [always] know them [but] We know them. We will cause them to suffer twice as much [in this world,] and then they will face a severe punishment","9:102":"And there are others, who, after having done both good and bad deeds, confessed their sins. God may accept their repentance because God is forgiving and Merciful-to-all","9:103":"Accept their offerings for the sake of God, that it may cleanse them and cause them to grow in purity, and pray for them. Your prayer will comfort them. God hears everything, and He knows everything","9:104":"Do they not know that God alone can accept the repentance of His worshipers and is the [true] recipient of what is offered for His sake, and that God alone is the Acceptor of Repentance, the Merciful-to-all","9:105":"Say: \"Act! And God will see your deeds, and so will His Messenger and the believers. [In the end], you will be brought before Him who knows the unknown and the known, and He will tell you what you have been doing","9:106":"And yet, there are others who are waiting for God's decree, either to punish them or to show them His mercy. God knows everything, and He is wise","9:107":"(As for those hypocrites) who have established a [separate] house of worship in order to create trouble, causing unbelief and disunity among the believers, and providing a base for those who previously fought God and His Messenger. They will definitely swear, \"We have only the best of intentions,\" while God testifies that they are lying","9:108":"[Prophet,] never pray in that mosque. Rather, you should pray only in a mosque founded from its very first day on consciousness of God. That is a place where men want to grow in purity. God loves everyone who purifies himself","9:109":"Which is better, one who has founded his building on God-consciousness and a desire for His acceptance, or he who has founded his building on the edge of a crumbling cliff that will tumble down with him into Hellfire? God does not guide people who are [deliberately] unjust","9:110":"The building they built will always be a source of skepticism within their hearts until their hearts are torn to pieces. God knows everything, and He is wise","9:111":"God has purchased the souls and possessions of the believers, promising them paradise in return. They fight in God's cause, and they kill and are killed. It is a true promise given by Him in the Torah, the Gospel, and the Qur'an. Who could be more faithful to his promise than God? Rejoice in this good news! This is the bargain you have made with Him. This is the ultimate victory","9:112":"Those are the ones who turn to God in repentance, who worship and praise Him. They journey, bow before Him and prostrate themselves in adoration. They order what is obviously right and forbid what is obviously wrong, and stay within the boundaries set by God. So, give good news to the believers","9:113":"It is not for the Prophet and the believers to pray for forgiveness for the idolaters-even if they are related-after it has been made clear to them that those [sinners] are destined for Hell","9:114":"Abraham's prayer that his father would be forgiven was due to a promise that he had given his father. However, when it became clear to him that his father was one of God's enemies, he renounced him, even though Abraham was tender-hearted, tolerant","9:115":"God would not lead astray those He has already guided to the faith, unless He first makes it entirely clear to them what they should avoid. God knows everything","9:116":"To God, alone, belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He, alone, has the power over life and death. There is none besides Him who can protect you or help you","9:117":"God has forgiven the Prophet, as well as those emigrants and supporters who followed him in the hour of distress, after the hearts of some of them had hesitated. Then He forgave them. He is compassionate, merciful","9:118":"He also forgave the three who stayed behind. They had [come to feel that] the earth, for all its vastness, was closing in on them, and that their souls were narrowing [as well], until they realized that the only refuge from God was to be with Him. He turned to them in mercy so that they would return to Him. God alone is the accepter of repentance and is merciful","9:119":"Believers, remain mindful of God and be among those who are truthful","9:120":"It is not appropriate for the people of Medina and the Bedouins [who live] around them to stay behind [and refuse to follow] God's Messenger. Nor should they care about themselves more than they care for him. This is because a righteous deed is registered to their favor every time they suffer from thirst, weariness or hunger in God's cause, or take any step that angers the unbelievers, or cause any harm to any enemy. God never loses track of the rewards [due] those who do good","9:121":"They will spend no amount, large or small [for God's sake], nor cross any valley [in God's cause] that will not be credited to them. God will reward them according to the best of their deeds","9:122":"The believers shouldn't all go to battle. From within every group, some should devote themselves to acquiring deeper knowledge of the Faith; to teach their people when they return. So they might be on their guard","9:123":"Believers, fight against the unbelievers who live nearer to you, and let them find you tough in your determination. Know that God is with those who are mindful of Him","9:124":"Whenever a chapter is revealed, some ask, \"Which of you has this increased in faith?\" As for those who believe, it strengthens them in their faith, and they rejoice in the good news [it brings them]","9:125":"As for those who have diseased hearts, [each new revelation] adds only [more] disbelief to their disbelief, and they die as unbelievers","9:126":"Do not they realize that they are being tested once or twice a year? Yet, they do not repent, nor do they remember","9:127":"and whenever a chapter is revealed, they look at one another and say, \"Is anyone watching you?\" And then they leave. God has turned their hearts away from the truth because they are people who will not be able to understand","9:128":"A messenger has come to you from among yourselves. Your suffering weighs heavily upon him. He is deeply concerned for you and full of compassion and mercy towards the believers","9:129":"If they turn away, say, \"God is sufficient for me. There is no God but Him. In Him I have put my trust, for He is the Lord of the magnificent Throne of His majesty","10:1":"Alif Lam Ra, these are the verses of the Wise Book","10:2":"Do people find it really amazing that We sent revelations to a man from among them, saying: \"Warn all people, and give good news to those who believe that in the sight of their Lord, they are considered truthful.\" But the unbelievers say, \"He is clearly a sorcerer","10:3":"Your Lord is God, who has created the heavens and the earth in six days. He then settled on the throne of His majesty, governing everything that exists. No one can intercede with Him unless He first gives His permission. This is God, your Lord: worship Him. Will you not, then, keep this in mind","10:4":"You will all return to Him: this is a true promise from God. He begins the process of creation, and then He repeats it so that He may justly reward all who believe and do good works. However, those who refuse to believe will have boiling drinks and grievous suffering because of their refusal to acknowledge the truth","10:5":"He has made the sun radiant light and the moon a source of enlightenment for He has plotted out its phases so that you may know how to calculate the years and measure time. There is a purpose to everything God created in Truth. He explains His messages to those who are willing to know","10:6":"In the succession of night and day, and in all that God has created in the heavens and on the earth, there are signs for those who are aware of Him","10:7":"Those who do not believe that they are destined to meet Us-being content with their worldly life and unable to see beyond it, paying no attention to Our signs","10:8":"will have the fire for their home in return for all they have deserved","10:9":"As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, their Lord guides them because of their faith. Streams will flow at their feet in Gardens of pleasure","10:10":"There they will call out, \"Glory be to You, God,\" their greeting will be \"Peace,\" and the last part of their prayer will be, \"All praise is due to God, the Lord of the worlds","10:11":"Were God to rush punishment for people in the same way they rush toward what they consider good, their time would already be up. We will leave those who do not believe they are destined to meet Us to wander blindly in their arrogance","10:12":"When trouble afflicts man, he cries to Us, whether he is lying on his side, or sitting, or standing, but, as soon as We have freed him of his trouble, he carries on as though he had never called on Us to save him from his trouble. In this way the deeds of such overindulgent people seem right in their own eyes","10:13":"We destroyed earlier generations when they transgressed in spite of the evidence of truth brought to them by their messengers, whom they refused to believe. This is how we punish those who force others to reject God's messages","10:14":"We then made you their successors on earth, so We could see what you would do","10:15":"Whenever Our messages are clearly conveyed to them, those who do not believe that they are destined to meet Us will say, \"Bring us a different Qur'an, or change it.\" Say [Prophet], \"It is not up to me to change it of my own accord; I follow only what is revealed to me. I fear the punishment of that Monumental Day [of Judgment] if I were to disobey my Lord","10:16":"Say, \"If God had willed it, I would not have conveyed this [Book] to you, nor would He have brought it to your knowledge. I was among you for an entire lifetime before it came to me. Why cannot you think","10:17":"Who could be more unjust than someone who makes up lies against God or denies His revelations? Those who force others to reject God's messages will never prosper","10:18":"[nor will] they [who] worship things other than God-things that can neither harm nor benefit them-saying, \"These are our intercessors with God.\" Say, \"Do you [think that you could] inform God about something in the heavens or on earth that He does not know? May He be exalted in His glory, and far higher above all they associate with Him","10:19":"People were once a single community, but later they began to hold divergent views. Had it not been for a prior decree from your Lord, their differences would already have been settled","10:20":"They ask, \"Why has his Lord never given him any miraculous sign?\" Say, \"The unknown belongs to God, so wait, and I will wait with you","10:21":"Whenever We let [such] people experience Our grace after they have endured hardship, they then turn to plot against Our messages. Say, \"God plots even faster. Our [heavenly] messengers are tracking all of your plotting","10:22":"He enables you to travel on land and sea, until-while they are sailing on ships and rejoicing in favorable winds-a storm arrives, and waves come towards them from all directions, so that you think you are facing death. Then they cry out to God in all sincerity, claiming faith in Him alone: \"If You save us from this, We will be truly thankful","10:23":"Once He has saved them, they return to being corruptive on earth in defiance to the Truth. People! All your outrageous deeds will be counted against you; your enjoyment is limited to life in this world. Then you will return to Us, and We will confront you with everything You have done","10:24":"The example of life on earth is like rain that We send down, which stimulates the growth of plants that humans and animals eat. Then, [just] as the earth takes on its finest appearance and is beautifully adorned, and its people think they have power over it, Our judgment comes to it suddenly, by night or day, and We reduce it to stubble, as if it had not flourished just the day before. We make Our messages clear to people who reflect on them","10:25":"God invites you to dwell in peace, and He guides whoever chooses to a straight path","10:26":"For those who do good, there is ultimate good in store, and even more besides. No darkness or shame will overshadow their faces [on Resurrection Day]. They are destined for Heaven, where they will remain forever","10:27":"As for those who have done evil deeds, one iniquity deserves another, shame will overshadow them, [and] they will have no one to protect them from God. Their faces will appear as if they were covered by the night's darkness. They are destined to live in the fire, and there they will remain","10:28":"On the [Judgment] Day We will gather them all together, [and] We will say to those who associated other [beings] with God, \"Stay where you are, you and your associates.\" Then We will separate them from one another. The partners will say, \"You were not supposed to worship us","10:29":"God is witness enough between you and us. We were unaware that you were worshipping us","10:30":"There, every soul will answer for its past deeds, and they will all return to God, their true Supreme Lord, and all their false deities will desert them","10:31":"Say, \"Who provides you with sustenance out of heaven and earth, or who has full power over hearing and sight? Who brings forward the living from the dead, and the dead from the living? Who administers all matters?\" They will say, \"God.\" Then say, \"will you not then be mindful of Him","10:32":"This is God, your Lord, the Ultimate Truth. What is beyond Truth except falsehood? How can you lose sight of the Truth","10:33":"Thus, your Lord's word proved to be true against those who defiantly disobeyed Him; they will not believe","10:34":"Say, \"Can any of your 'partners-gods' initiate creation, and then repeat it?\" Say, \"God initiates creation, and then repeats it. What falsehood are you preaching","10:35":"Say, \"Who among those 'partners-gods' you associated with Him guides you to the Truth?\" Say, \"It is God who guides to the Truth. Which is more worthy to be followed; He who guides you to the Truth, or he who cannot find the path unless he's guided? What is the matter with you? How do you judge","10:36":"Most of them follow nothing but speculations, which can never substitute for the Truth. God has full knowledge of all that they do","10:37":"This Qur'an could have never been created by anyone but God as a confirmation of what is available to him from earlier revelations and a detailed explanation of the Book that-let there be no doubt-is from the Lord of all the worlds","10:38":"Or do they say, \"He [the Prophet] has invented it?\" Say, \"Then produce a chapter of similar merit, and call on anyone you can other than God if what you say is true","10:39":"They are, in fact, denying what they cannot comprehend while its inner meaning has yet to become clear to them. In that same way, those who lived before them rejected belief, so reflect on the final fate of those who were unjust","10:40":"There are some among them who will eventually come to believe, just as there are some who will never believe. Your Lord is fully aware of those who cause corruption","10:41":"If they deny you, say, \"I act based on my own belief, and your acts are based on yours. You are not accountable for what I do, and I am not accountable for whatever you do","10:42":"Some of them listen to you, but, can you cause the deaf to hear if they do not understand","10:43":"Some of them look at you, but can you show the blind the right way even though they cannot see","10:44":"God does not wrong people at all but it is they who wrong themselves","10:45":"On the Day He gathers them together, it will be as if they have stayed [in this world] no longer than a single hour of the day, and they will recognize one another. Those who denied that they would ever meet God will be the losers, for they were not guided","10:46":"Whether We show you something of what We have promised them or retrieve you [first], they will still return to Us. Then God will be a witness to all that they have done","10:47":"Every nation has had a messenger, and, only after their messenger appeared [and delivered his message] will they be justly judged; they will not be dealt with unfairly","10:48":"They ask, \"When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are telling the truth","10:49":"Say, \"I have no power to harm or help myself, except as God wills. An appointed time has been set for every nation, and, when they reach their appointed time, they can neither delay it by a single hour nor speed it up","10:50":"Say, \"Have you ever considered how you would feel if His punishment were to befall you by night or by day? What part of it would those who force others to reject God's messages wish to speed up","10:51":"Say, \"Will you believe [only] when it actually befalls you. Now [at the Judgment, you believe], whereas [before] you tried to hasten it","10:52":"Then the wrongdoers will be told, \"Taste eternal punishment. Why should you be repaid [with anything] other than what you have earned","10:53":"Some people ask you, \"Is this really true?\" Say, \"Yes, by my Lord, it is definitely true, and you cannot prevent it","10:54":"Even if each soul that had done wrong possessed everything on earth, it would surely offer it [that day] in ransom. They will show remorse when they see the punishment; they will be judged justly, and they will not be treated unfairly","10:55":"Everything that is in the heavens and on earth belongs to God. God's promise always comes true, but most of them do not know this","10:56":"He is the One who grants life and deals death, and you will all be returned to Him","10:57":"People, a lesson has now come to you from your Lord, and a cure for what is in your hearts, and guidance and grace to the believers","10:58":"Say, \"It is grace and mercy from God, so let them rejoice; it is better than all [the wealth] that they have accumulated","10:59":"Say, \"Have you considered the sustenance that God has sent down to you, some [of which] you have made unlawful and some lawful?\" Say, \"Has God given you permission [to do this], or are you inventing lies about God","10:60":"What would those people who invent lies about God think on the Day of Resurrection? God's grace is limitless towards people, but most of them are ungrateful","10:61":"Whatever you [Prophet] are doing, or whatever part of the Qur'an you may be reciting, and whatever you [people] are doing, We are watching you when you are doing it. Not an atom's weight escapes your Lord on earth or in heaven, nor is there anything even smaller or larger [that is not] recoded in a clear book","10:62":"Truly, those who are loyal to God do not need to fear, and they will not grieve","10:63":"[For] those who believe and are ever mindful of God","10:64":"there is good news in the life of this world and the life to come. There is no changing the words of God; this is truly the supreme triumph","10:65":"And you [Prophet] should not be grieved by what they say. All might belongs entirely to God: He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing","10:66":"Verily, everyone in heaven and on earth belongs to God. Those who invoke other [beings] besides God are not really calling on His associates; they are only following their guess, and they only tell lies","10:67":"It is He who has made the night for you, so that you might rest, and the day, to give you sight. Truly there are messages in this for people who hear","10:68":"They say, \"God has taken a son. May He be exalted in His glory. He is self-sufficient beyond needs. Everything that is in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him.\" You have no authority to say this. How dare you say about God what you do not know","10:69":"Say, \"Those who invent lies about God will never prosper","10:70":"They may have brief enjoyment in this world, but they will return to Us, and We will make them taste severe suffering because of their denial of the truth","10:71":"Tell them the story of Noah, when he said to his people, \"My people, if my presence [among you] and my reminding you of God's messages has become too much for you to bear, then my trust is really placed in God. So, decide with your 'partner-gods' what you want to do, and do not be hesitant; do with me whatever you decide, and do not keep me waiting","10:72":"If you turn away, I have asked for nothing from you; my reward is from God, for I was commanded to be among those who have surrendered themselves to Him","10:73":"[Nevertheless,] they denied him, so We rescued him and all those with him in the ark and made them successors, while We drowned those who denied our messages. See what happened to those who were forewarned","10:74":"After him, We sent [other] messengers, each to his own people, who brought them evidence of the truth, but they were not going to believe anything they had already rejected. It is in this way that We seal the hearts of the transgressors","10:75":"Afterward, We sent Moses and Aaron with Our messages to Pharaoh and his inner circle, but they acted arrogantly because they had decided to severe all relations to God and to reject Him","10:76":"So, when the Truth came to them from Us, they said, \"This is nothing but clear sorcery","10:77":"Moses said, \"You are calling it sorcery when the Truth was being given to you? Sorcerers can never prosper","10:78":"They said, \"Have you come to turn us away from what we found our forefathers believing so that the two of you might become supreme in this land? We do not believe in the two of you","10:79":"So Pharaoh commanded, \"Bring every sorcerer of great knowledge before me","10:80":"When the sorcerers came, Moses said to them, \"Throw whatever you may throw","10:81":"When they had thrown down, Moses said to them, \"Everything you have done is sorcery, and God will show it to be false. God does not support the works of those who cause corruption","10:82":"God confirms the Truth by His words, even though those who force others to reject God's messages hate it","10:83":"Only a handful of Moses' people declared their faith in him, [while others held back] for fear that Pharaoh would persecute them and their own people. Pharaoh was mighty on earth and prone to excesses","10:84":"Moses said, \"My people, if you believe in God, place your trust in Him if you have [truly] surrendered yourselves to Him","10:85":"They answered, \"We have placed our trust in God. Our Lord, do not make us an object of persecution for the people who do evil","10:86":"and save us, by Your grace, from people who deny the truth","10:87":"We revealed to Moses and his brother, \"Make homes for your people in Egypt and [tell them], 'Turn your houses into places of worship and be constant in prayer.' Give good news to the believers","10:88":"Moses prayed, \"Lord, You have given Pharaoh and his inner circle splendor and wealth in this life, and they are leading others astray from your path. Lord, wipe out their riches and harden their hearts, so that they will not attain faith until they see painful suffering","10:89":"God said, \"Your [and Aaron's] prayer is accepted. Continue steadfastly on the right path, and do not follow the path of those who have no knowledge","10:90":"We then brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his troops pursued them in arrogance and aggression, until, when he was about to drown, [Pharaoh] cried out, \"I believe that there is no God except the one the Children of Israel believe in, and I am of those who surrender themselves to Him","10:91":"[And God said], \"[Only] now? When [before] you rebelled and lived among those who caused corruption","10:92":"Today We will save only your body, so that you may be a sign to those who will come after you. Many people fail to heed Our signs","10:93":"We then settled the Children of Israel in a good place and provided them with good things to sustain them. And it was not until knowledge [of God's revelation] had come to them that they began to bicker among themselves. Your Lord will judge between them on Resurrection Day regarding all of their differences","10:94":"So if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to you, ask those who been reading the Book [revealed] before your time. The Truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so do not be one of the doubters","10:95":"or [one of] those who deny God's messages, lest you be among the doomed","10:96":"Those against whom the words of your Lord are justly carried out will not believe","10:97":"even though every sign comes to them, until they see the agonizing suffering","10:98":"There had never been a single community that believed and benefited from its faith except Jonah's people. When they believed, We relieved them from the disgrace of suffering in the life of this world and allowed them to enjoy their life for a time","10:99":"Had your Lord willed, all the people on earth would have believed, all of them entirely. Is it, then, up to you [Prophet] to compel People to believe","10:100":"No soul can ever believe except with God's permission, and He brings disgrace on those who will not use their reason","10:101":"Say, \"Look at what there is in the heavens and on earth.\" But signs and warnings will not help the people who will not believe","10:102":"What are they waiting for other than the punishment which came to those before them? Say, \"Wait, then, and I will be waiting with you","10:103":"Then We will save Our Messengers and those who believe. It is incumbent upon us to save the believers","10:104":"Say, \"People, if you are in doubt as to what my faith is, then [know that] I do not worship those you worship besides God, but I worship God alone, Who will eventually retrieve you back to Him, and I am commanded to be among the believers","10:105":"[Prophet,] set your face towards this faith, as a man inclined to the truth. Do not be among those who violate God's unity","10:106":"Do not call on any besides God who can neither benefit you nor harm you. If you do it, you will be among the unjust","10:107":"If God inflicts harm on you, no one can remove it except for Him, and, if He intends good for you, no one can turn away His favor. He grants His bounty to any of His worshipers whom He wills. He alone is truly forgiving, the true Purveyor of Mercy","10:108":"Say, \"People, the Truth has come to you from your Lord. Whoever chooses to follow the path of guidance follows it for his own good, and whoever chooses to go astray does so to his own loss. I am not responsible for your conduct","10:109":"Follow what is being revealed to you, and be patient in hard times until God gives His judgment. He is the best of all judges","11:1":"Alif Lam Ra, [this is] a Book whose verses are perfectly constructed, then detailed directly from the grace of the Wise, the Most Expert","11:2":"so that you may worship no one but God. I am sent to you from Him to warn you and to give you good news","11:3":"Ask your Lord to forgive your sins and turn towards Him in repentance. He will let you enjoy a good life until a specified time, and will bestow His abundant grace on all who have virtues. But, if you turn away, I dread the suffering [which is bound to befall you] on that Mighty Day","11:4":"You must all return to God, as He has power over everything","11:5":"See how they turn away, trying to hide from Him. Even when they cover themselves with their clothes, He knows all that they hide and what they reveal. He has full knowledge of what is in men's hearts","11:6":"Every living creature on earth depends on God for sustenance and He knows where it lives and where it dies. It is all in a clear record","11:7":"He created the heavens and the earth in six days and the throne of His majesty of His Mightiness extended over the water. [He created this] in order to test which of you is best in deeds. And If you [Prophet] say, \"You will be resurrected after death,\" the unbelievers will answer, \"This is clearly nothing but sorcery","11:8":"If We defer their suffering for a specified time, they are sure to say, \"What is preventing it [from coming now]?\" On the Day when it befalls them there will be nothing to divert it from them and they will be overwhelmed by the very thing they mocked","11:9":"If We let man taste some of Our mercy and then take it away from him, he will abandon all hope, forgetting all gratitude","11:10":"If We let him taste ease and plenty after hardship has touched him, he is sure to say, \"Misfortune has gone away from me.\" He becomes overjoyed and boastful","11:11":"Except those who are patient in hard times and do righteous deeds: forgiveness of sins awaits them and a great reward","11:12":"Perhaps you are thinking about omitting part of what is being revealed to you, and you feel a tightness in your chest about it because they say, \"If only a treasure were sent down to him, or an angel came with him [then we would believe].\" [Prophet,] you are only a warner, it is God who is in charge of everything","11:13":"Or, they [may] say, \"He invented it.\" Say, \"Produce ten invented chapters of similar merit, and call in whoever you can besides God to help you, if what you say is true","11:14":"But if they [whom you called] do not respond to you, then know that [this Qur'an) has been revealed with God's knowledge and that there is no God but Him. Then will you submit to Him","11:15":"As for those who care only for the life of this world and its bounties, We will repay [them] fully for everything they did, and they will be given nothing less","11:16":"But, in the life to come, they will have nothing but the fire; their works will be fruitless, and their deeds futile","11:17":"Can they be compared to those who have clear evidence from their Lord, conveyed through [this] testimony from Him-as was the book previously revealed to Moses-to be a guide and mercy [to humanity]? Those [who understand] believe in it, whereas those parties that deny its truth are promised the fire. Have no doubt about [this revelation]; it is the Truth from your Lord, though most people do not believe so","11:18":"Who could be more unjust than he who attributes his own lie to God? [Such people] will be arraigned before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, \"They uttered lies about their Lord.\" God's rejection is what the unjust deserve","11:19":"[those] who turn others away from the path of God-trying to make it crooked-and refuse to acknowledge the truth of the life to come","11:20":"They can never escape [their final reckoning, even if they remain unharmed] on earth; they will never find anyone who can protect them from God. Double suffering will be imposed on them for having lost the ability to hear [the truth] and failed to see [it]","11:21":"They have allowed themselves to be lost. All their invented gods will have deserted them","11:22":"Assuredly, in the life to come, they will lose the most","11:23":"[Only] those who believe and do righteous deeds and humble themselves before their Lord are destined for Heaven, where they will remain for eternity","11:24":"These two groups are like the blind and deaf in comparison to those who see and hear. Can they be alike? How can you not pay attention","11:25":"[In like manner], We sent Noah to his people, [saying], \"I come to you with the plain warning","11:26":"that you may worship no one but God. I fear that you may suffer on a painful Day","11:27":"The notables among his people who denied the truth said, \"We do not see anything in you but a mortal man like ourselves, and it is clear to see that only the worst among us follow you. We do not see that you could be superior to us in any way. On the contrary, we think you are a liar","11:28":"[Noah] said, \"My people, have you considered that I might have a clear sign from my Lord, and that He has given me grace of His own even though it is not apparent to you? [In that case,] could we compel you to accept it against your will","11:29":"My people, I ask you no reward for it. My reward rests with none but God. I will not chase away the faithful. They know they are destined to meet their Lord, and I can see that you are foolish","11:30":"People, who could protect me from God if I chased [the faithful] away? Will you not take heed","11:31":"I do not say to you, 'God's treasures are with me,' nor [do I say], 'I have knowledge of what is hidden,' nor do I say, 'I am an angel,' nor do I say of those you hold in contempt, 'God will not grant them any good.' God is fully aware of what is in their hearts. If I did this, I would be among the unjust","11:32":"[The notables] said, \"Noah, you have argued with us for too long. Bring down on us the punishment with which you threaten us if you are a man of truth","11:33":"He answered, \"Only God will bring it upon you, if He so wills and you will not escape it","11:34":"My advice will be no use to you if God wills that you remain lost in your delusions. He is your Lord, and to Him you must return","11:35":"Or do they [the idolaters] say he has invented this [story]?\" Say [Muhammad] \"If I have invented it, I am responsible for my own crime, but I am innocent of the crime of which you are guilty","11:36":"It was revealed to Noah, \"None of your people will believe other than those who have already done so. Do not be distressed by anything that they may do","11:37":"Build the Ark under Our observation and Our inspiration, and do not appeal to Me on behalf of the transgressors. They are destined to be drowned","11:38":"[Noah] began to build the Ark, and every time the notables of his people passed by him, they mocked him. He said, \"If you are mocking us now, we will come to mock you [and your ignorance] just as you are mocking us","11:39":"In time you will know who will receive a humiliating punishment, and on whom a lasting suffering will descend","11:40":"When Our judgment came, and waters gushed up, We said, \"Place on board this [Ark] a pair of each species, as well as your family-except those against whom the sentence has already been passed-and the Believers,\" though only a few [of Noah's people] shared his faith","11:41":"He said [to his followers], \"Board this Ark. In the name of God it will sail and anchor. My Lord is much-forgiving, a dispenser of grace","11:42":"It sailed with them on waves that were like mountains. Noah cried out to his son, who stayed behind, \"Come aboard with us my son, and do not stay with the unbelievers","11:43":"[The son] answered, \"I will take myself to a mountain that will protect me from the waters.\" [Noah] said, \"Today there is no protection [for anyone] from God's judgment, except [for) those who have earned [His] mercy.\" A wave rose up between them, and [the son] was among those who drowned","11:44":"Then it was said [by God], \"Earth, swallow up your water, and sky, stop [your rain].\" The waters sank into the earth, and the will [of God] was done, and the ark came to rest on Mount Judi. It was said [by God], \"Away with those evildoing folk","11:45":"Noah called out to his Lord and said, \"My Lord, my son was my family; Your promise always comes true, and You are the most just of all judges","11:46":"[God] answered, \"Noah, he was not your family, because he was unrighteous in his conduct. Do not ask me for things you know nothing about. I am warning you not to be foolish","11:47":"[Noah] said, \"My Lord, I seek refuge with You from ever [again] asking You anything about which I know nothing. Unless You forgive me and have mercy on me, I will be among the lost","11:48":"It was said [by God], \"Noah, descend in peace from Us and with blessings on you as well as on [some of the] nations [that descend] from among those who are with you. [But as for] others [of their descendants], We will allow them to enjoy life [for a little while], and then a painful punishment from Us will afflict them","11:49":"These accounts are part of what was beyond your knowledge [Muhammad]. We revealed them to you. Neither you nor your people knew them, so be patient [like Noah] in hard times. The future belongs to those who are mindful of God","11:50":"To [the tribe of] 'Ad, [We sent] their brother, Hud. He said, \"My people worship God [alone]. You have no God other than Him. You are making up lies","11:51":"I ask no reward from you. My reward rests only with Him who created me. Why don't you use your common sense","11:52":"My people, ask your Lord to forgive your sins, and then turn towards Him in repentance. He will shower you with abundant heavenly grace and will add strength to your strength. Do not turn away and be lost in sin","11:53":"They replied, \"Hud, you have brought us no clear evidence [that you are a prophet], and we are not going to forsake our gods on the strength of your word alone, nor do we believe in you","11:54":"All we can say is that one of our gods has inflicted some harm on you.\" [Hud] answered, \"I call God to witness, and you too are my witnesses, that I disown those to whom you ascribe divinity","11:55":"except for God. Plot [anything that you may wish] against me, and give me no respite","11:56":"I have placed my trust in God, [who is] my Lord and your Lord. There is no living creature that He does not control. My Lord's way is a straight path","11:57":"But if they turn away, then say, \"I have delivered to you the messages with which I was sent, and my Lord will bring along another people to take your place, whereas you will in no way harm Him. My lord watches over all things","11:58":"When Our judgment came to pass, by Our grace We saved Hud and his fellow believers. We saved them from severe suffering [in the life to come] as well","11:59":"That was [the end of 'Ad, [who] rejected their Lord's messages, and rebelled against His Messengers, and followed the command of every arrogant enemy of the truth","11:60":"They were rejected in this world, and so will they be on the Day of Resurrection. 'Ad denied their Lord. So away with 'Ad, the people of Hud","11:61":"To [the tribe of] Thamud [We sent] their brother Salih. He said, \"My people, worship God [alone]. You have no God other than Him. He created you out of the earth and made you inhabit it. Ask Him to forgive your sins, and turn towards Him in repentance. My Lord is near, and ready to answer [whoever calls to Him]","11:62":"They answered, \"Salih, We used to have such great hopes in you. Would you forbid us to worship what our forefathers worshipped? We are in grave doubt, amounting to suspicion, about what you are asking us to do","11:63":"He retorted, \"My people, just think, if I am taking my stand based on clear evidence from my Lord, and if He had given me mercy of His own, who could protect me from God if I disobeyed Him? You would only make my loss greater","11:64":"My people, this camel belongs to God; it will be a sign for you. Leave it to pasture on God's land and do her no harm, or you will soon be punished","11:65":"However, they cruelly slaughtered her. [Salih] said, \"You will enjoy life in your homes for only three [more] days; this is a judgment which will not prove false","11:66":"When Our command was fulfilled, We saved Salih and those who shared his faith as a mercy from us, and [We saved them] from the disgrace of [Our rejection on] that Day [of Resurrection]. Your Lord alone is powerful, almighty","11:67":"The blast [of God's punishment] overtook the evildoers, and they lay lifeless in their homes and on the ground","11:68":"as though they had never lived there. Thamud denied their Lord, so away with Thamud","11:69":"To Abraham, Our [heavenly] Messengers brought good news. They said, \"Peace,\" and he answered, \"[And upon you be] peace.\" Without delay he placed a roasted calf before them","11:70":"When he saw that their hands did not reach out towards it, he found this strange and became apprehensive of them. They said, \"Do not fear. We are sent against the people of Lot","11:71":"His wife, standing [nearby], laughed [with happiness]. We gave her the good news of [the birth of] Isaac, and, after Isaac, of [Isaac's son] Jacob","11:72":"She said, \"Alas for me. How am I to bear a child when I am now an old woman, and this husband of mine is an old man? That would be an astonishing thing","11:73":"[The Messengers] said, \"Are you astonished at God's command? May the mercy of God and His blessing be upon you, people of this house. For He is worthy of all praise and Glory","11:74":"When the fear left Abraham and the good news had been conveyed to him, he began to plead with Us for Lot's people","11:75":"Abraham was forbearing, tender-hearted, and devout","11:76":"[God's Messengers replied,] \"Abraham, stop this [pleading]. Your Lord's judgment has already passed. Punishment is coming to them, which cannot be turned back","11:77":"When Our Messengers came to Lot, he was sad for [his people], seeing that it was beyond his power to protect them, and he said, \"This is a truly terrible day","11:78":"His people came running to him; they were accustomed to committing foul deeds. [Lot] said, \"My people, take my daughters instead. They are purer for you [than men]. Fear God, and do not disgrace me with my guests. Is there not a single right-minded man among you","11:79":"They answered, \"You have always known that we have no right to your daughters. You know very well what we want","11:80":"[Lot] exclaimed, \"If only I had the strength to defeat you or could rely on mightier support","11:81":"[The angels] said, \"Lot, we are Messengers from your Lord. [Your enemies] will never reach you. Leave with your household in the dead of night, and do not look back. [Take all of your family with you] with the exception of your wife. The fate which will befall [the people of Sodom] will befall her [as well]. Their appointed time is the morning. Is not the morning near","11:82":"When Our judgment came about, We turned those [sinful towns] upside down and rained down on them stones of hard clay, layer after layer, [which were]","11:83":"designated by your Lord [to punish sinners]. [Such punishment] is never far from the unjust","11:84":"To [the people of] Midian [We sent] their brother Shu'ayb. He said, \"My people, worship God [alone]. You have no God other than Him. Do not give [false] measure or weight [in your dealings with people]. I see that you are prospering, but I fear for your suffering on a day that will encompass you [with doom]","11:85":"Hence, my people, [always] give full measure and weight, with equity, and do not deprive people of what is rightfully theirs, and do not act wickedly on earth by spreading corruption","11:86":"What rests with God is best for you, if you are believers. I am not your keeper","11:87":"They said, \"Shu'ayb, does your prayer really command you that we give up what our forefathers worshipped or to refrain from doing with our wealth whatever we please? You certainly sound like the perfect tolerant and right-minded man","11:88":"He answered, \"My people, what if I am acting on clear evidence from my Lord, and He Himself has given me good provision? I have no desire to differ from you concerning what I have forbidden you. I want no more than to set things right as much as I can. I cannot succeed without God's help. I have placed my trust in Him, and I always turn to Him","11:89":"My people, do not let [your] disagreement with me drive you into sin and bring upon you a fate similar to that of the people of Noah or Hud or Salih, and [remember that] the people of Lot did not live very far from you","11:90":"Ask your Lord to forgive your sins, and then turn towards Him in repentance. My Lord is the Mercy-Giver and Most-Loving","11:91":"[His people] said, \"Shu'ayb, We cannot understand much of what you say. In fact, we find you weak [and poorly connected] among us, and, were it not for your clan, we would have stoned you to death, considering that you have no status among us","11:92":"He said, \"My people, do you hold my clan in greater esteem than God, that you turned your backs on Him? My Lord is fully aware of all that you do","11:93":"Hence, do what you think is best, and I will do what I think is best. In time you will certainly know who will receive a punishment to disgrace him, and who is a liar. Watch [for what is coming]. I will watch with you","11:94":"When Our judgment came to pass, by Our mercy We saved Shu'ayb and those who shared his faith, while the blast [of Our punishment] overtook those who had done wrong, and they lay lifeless in their homes","11:95":"as though they had never lived there. Away with [the people of] Midian, as was done away with [the people of] Thamud","11:96":"We sent Moses with Our messages and clear authority","11:97":"to Pharaoh and his inner circle, but they followed Pharaoh's orders, and Pharaoh's orders were misguided","11:98":"On the Day of Resurrection, he will go before his people, having led them towards the fire. Miserable is the destination to which they are led","11:99":"They were pursued by [God's] rejection in this [world], and [will be overtaken by it] on the Day of Resurrection. What a rotten gift to be given","11:100":"These are parts of the accounts of those [ancient] communities that We are relating to you; some still remain, and some are [extinct, like] a field mown down","11:101":"We did not wrong them; they wronged themselves. When your Lord's judgment was ordained, those deities of theirs, which they called on instead of God, proved to be of no use to them and only increased their ruin","11:102":"Such is the punishment of your Lord when He decides to punish a community for their transgression. His punishment is painful and severe","11:103":"In that is a sign for anyone who fears the suffering [which may befall them] in the Hereafter. That is the Day on which people will be gathered together-that is a Day to be witnessed","11:104":"[and] which We will not delay beyond a specified period","11:105":"When that Day comes, not a soul will speak except by His permission. Some will be miserable, and some will be blessed","11:106":"As for those who will have brought misery upon themselves, [they will live] in the fire, moaning and groaning","11:107":"where they will remain as long as the heavens and the earth endure, unless your Lord wills otherwise. Your Lord is the doer of what He wills","11:108":"As for those who will be blessed, [they will live] in Heaven, to stay as long as the heavens and the earth endure, unless your Lord wills otherwise-an uninterrupted blessing","11:109":"[Prophet], have no doubt about what these [misguided people] worship. They worship as their forefathers worshipped before them, and We will certainly give them their full share [for whatever good or evil they have earned], with no reduction","11:110":"We gave Moses the Book before you, but they were in dispute about it. Were it not for a prior decree from your Lord, it would have been settled between them. Still they had suspicious doubts about it [the Torah]","11:111":"Your Lord will give everyone their full due for whatever [good or evil] they may have done. He is aware of everything they do","11:112":"Remain steadfast, as you have been commanded [by God], together with all those along with you who have turned to Him. Do not let anyone overstep the limits, because He sees all that you do","11:113":"Do not incline towards those who do evil, lest the fire touch you. You will [then] have no one to protect you from God, nor will you be helped","11:114":"Be constant in prayer at the beginning and end of the day, as well as during parts of the night. Good deeds drive away evil deeds. This is a reminder to the mindful","11:115":"Be patient in hard times. God does not fail to repay those who do good","11:116":"If only-among the generations before your time-there had been people with good sense to speak out against corruption on earth, [as did] the few of them whom We saved.

To this end He created them. The word of your Lord will be fulfilled: \"I will definitely fill Hell with both jinn and humans","11:120":"So, [Prophet], We have relayed the accounts of the [earlier] messengers to you in order to make your heart firm. The Truth comes to you through these accounts, as well as lessons and reminders for the believers","11:121":"Say to those who will not believe, \"Do anything that is within your power, while we labor [in God's way]","11:122":"and wait [for what is coming]. We are waiting too","11:123":"God alone comprehends the hidden reality of the heavens and the earth. Everything that exists goes back to Him, so worship Him and place your trust in Him alone.

I saw them bow before me","12:5":"[Jacob] replied, \"My son, do not tell your brothers your dream, or they may plot to harm you [out of envy]. Satan is man's open enemy","12:6":"And thus Your Lord will choose you, and will teach you to interpret some events, and will perfect His grace on you and on the House of Jacob, just as He perfected it earlier upon your forefathers Abraham and Isaac. Your Lord is All-Knowing, All-Wise","12:7":"In [the story of] Joseph and his brothers, there are messages for all who search [for the truth]","12:8":"[Joseph's brothers] said [to one another], \"Joseph and his brother [Benjamin] are dearer to our father than we are, even though we are so many. Our father is clearly wrong","12:9":"[One of them said],\"Kill Joseph or drive him away to some [faraway] land, so that your father's attention will be free to turn to you. After this is done, you will be [free to repent and to live once again as] righteous people","12:10":"Another of them said, \"Do not kill Joseph. If you must do something, throw him into the dark depths of this well, where some caravan may pick him up","12:11":"[They agreed on this course, and] they spoke [to Jacob], \"Father, why don't you trust us with Joseph, seeing as we wish him well","12:12":"Let him go out with us tomorrow, so that he may play and enjoy himself, and We will protect him well","12:13":"[Jacob] said, \"The thought of you taking him away with you worries me. I am afraid a wolf may eat him at a moment when you are not paying attention","12:14":"They said, \"If the wolf were to devour him when there are so many of us, we would be the real losers","12:15":"When they went away with him and decided to throw him into the dark depths of a well, We inspired him, saying, \"One day, you will remind them of their deed at a time when they will least expect it","12:16":"At nightfall they returned to their father, weeping","12:17":"[and] said, \"Father, we were racing with one another, and left Joseph behind with our things, and a wolf devoured him. [We know that] you will not believe us even though we are telling the truth","12:18":"and they produced his shirt deceptively stained with blood. [Jacob] exclaimed, \"Rather your souls have enticed you to something. But patience is beautiful and it is to God [alone] that I pray for strength to cope with what you are saying to me","12:19":"A caravan came, and they sent someone to draw water. He sent down his bucket into the well, [and, when he saw Joseph] he said, \"Good news, there is a boy.\" They hid him with the intention of selling him, but God had full knowledge of everything that they were doing","12:20":"They sold him for a small price-a few pieces of silver-so little did they value him","12:21":"The man from Egypt who bought him said to his wife, \"Look after him well. He may be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son.\" In this way We gave Joseph a firm place on earth, and [We did this] so that We could teach him the inner meaning of things. God always prevails in His purpose, but most people do not know this","12:22":"When he reached full manhood, We gave him the ability to judge [between right and wrong], as well as knowledge; thus We reward those who do good","12:23":"The woman in whose house he was living tried to seduce him; she bolted the doors and said, \"Come to me.\" [Joseph] answered, \"God forbid! My master has been good to me. No good can come of [such a] wrong","12:24":"She desired him, and he desired her [and he would have succumbed] had he not seen evidence of his Lord's truth. We did this in order to keep evil and indecency away from him. He was truly one of Our chosen worshipers","12:25":"They both rushed to the door, and she tore his shirt from behind, and, at the door, they met her husband. She said, \"What, other than prison or painful punishment, should be the reward of someone who tried to dishonor your wife","12:26":"[Joseph] said, \"It was she who tried to seduce me.\" A member of her household suggested that, \"If his shirt has been torn from the front, then she is telling the truth and he is a liar","12:27":"but if his shirt has been torn from behind, then she is lying and he is telling the truth","12:28":"When [her husband] saw that his shirt was torn from behind, he said, \"This is another instance of women's treachery. Your treachery is truly great","12:29":"Joseph, overlook this. While you, [wife,] ask forgiveness for your sin-you are greatly at fault","12:30":"Some women of the town said [to one another], \"The governor's wife is trying to seduce her slave. Her love for him consumes her. We see that she is clearly lost","12:31":"When she heard about their gossip, she sent for them, and prepared a banquet for them, and handed each of them a knife. She said [to Joseph], \"Come out before them.\" When the women saw him, they were awestruck [by his beauty] and [so flustered that] they cut their hands [with their knives], saying, \"God save us. This is not a mortal man. He must be a precious angel","12:32":"She said, \"Here is the one you blamed me for. I sought to seduce him, but he firmly refused. Now, if he does not do what I order, he will be put in prison and will be humiliated","12:33":"He said, \"Lord, prison is more desirable to me than what these women are inviting me to do. If you do not protect me from their treachery, I might yield to their allure and so become one of the ignorant","12:34":"His Lord responded to his prayer and protected him from their treachery. He alone is All-Hearing, All-Knowing","12:35":"It occurred to the governor and his household after they had seen all the signs [of Joseph's innocence] that they should imprison him for a while","12:36":"Two young men happened to go to prison at the same time as Joseph. One of them said, \"I saw myself [in a dream] pressing wine.\" The other said, \"I saw myself [in a dream] carrying bread on my head, and birds were eating it.\" (They said to Joseph,] \"Tell us the real meaning of this. We see that you are a knowledgeable man","12:37":"[Joseph] answered, \"I will inform you of the interpreted meaning of your dreams before your meal arrives, for this is [part] of the knowledge which my Lord has taught me. I have left behind the way of people who do not believe in God and who persistently deny the truth of the life to come","12:38":"and I follow the faith of my forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It is not conceivable that we should ascribe divinity [to anything] beside God. Such is God's grace to us and all humanity, but most people are ungrateful","12:39":"Fellow prisoners, which is more reasonable: [belief in the existence of numerous divine] lords that are different from one another, or [in] the One God, who holds absolute power over all that exists","12:40":"All that you worship instead of God is nothing but [empty] names which you and your forefathers have invented, names for which God has sent down no authority. Judgment [as to what is right and what is wrong] rests with God alone, [and] He has ordered that you worship none but Him. This is the true faith, though most People do not realize it","12:41":"Fellow prisoners, [I will tell you the meaning of your dreams.] One of you will serve his master with wine to drink, but the other will be crucified, and birds will eat off of his head. [Whatever your future holds,] the matter on which you asked my opinion has been decided [by God]","12:42":"[Joseph] said to the one he knew would be saved, \"Mention me to your master [when you are free],\" but Satan caused him to forget to mention [Joseph] to his master, and so he remained in prison for a few [more] years","12:43":"[One day] the King said, \"I saw [in a dream] seven fat cows being devoured by seven [that were] lean; and seven green spikes [of grain] and [seven] others that were dry. Noblemen, enlighten me about [the meaning of] my dream if you are able to interpret dreams.\" They answered","12:44":"These are confusing dreams, and we have no deep knowledge of dream interpretation","12:45":"The prisoner who had been saved [suddenly] remembered [Joseph] after all that time, and said, \"I can inform you of the real meaning of this [dream], so send me forth","12:46":"[He went to see Joseph in prison and said to him], \"Truthful Joseph. Enlighten us about [the meaning of a dream in which] seven fat cows were being devoured by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and [seven] others that were dry, so that I may return [with your explanation] to the people [who sent me, and] inform them","12:47":"[Joseph] replied, \"You will sow for seven years as usual, but let all [the grain] that you harvest remain [untouched] in its spikes, except for a little that you may eat","12:48":"For, after that [period of seven good years], there will be seven years of hardship, which will consume all but a little of what you stored up for them","12:49":"After that will come a year in which the people will have abundant rain and will press grapes","12:50":"[As soon as Joseph's interpretation was conveyed to him,] the King said, \"Bring him before me.\" When the [King's] messenger came to him, [Joseph] said, \"Go back to your master and ask him [first to find out the truth] about those women who cut their hands-my Lord knows all about their treachery","12:51":"[The King sent for the women, and, when they came,] he asked, \"What was it that you hoped to achieve when you tried to seduce Joseph?\" The women answered, \"God save us. We know nothing bad of him.\" The wife of Joseph's former master said, \"Now the truth is out. It was I who tried to seduce him. He is an honest man","12:52":"[When Joseph learned what had happened, he said, \"I asked for] this so that [my former master] can know that I did not betray him behind his back. God does not guide the mischief of the treacherous","12:53":"I am not trying to absolve myself. Man's soul incites him to evil unless my Lord shows mercy. My Lord is much-forgiving, a Dispenser of Grace","12:54":"The King said, \"Bring him to me. I will have him serve me personally.\" When he had spoken with him, [the King] said, \"[From] now on you will have our trust and favor","12:55":"[Joseph] replied, \"Put me in charge of the nation's store-houses. I will be a knowledgeable keeper","12:56":"We established Joseph securely in that land to live wherever he wished. We grant Our grace upon whomever We will, and We do not fail to reward those who do good","12:57":"In the eyes of those who believe and have always been mindful of Us, a reward in the life to come is a far greater good [than any reward in this world]","12:58":"[After some years], Joseph's brothers came [to Egypt] and presented themselves before him, and he knew them [at once], but they did not recognize him","12:59":"When he had provided them with their provisions, he said, \"[When you come here next,] bring me the brother of yours from your father's side. Have you not seen me giving generous measure and being the best of hosts","12:60":"If you do not bring him to me, you will never again receive a single measure [of grain] from me, nor will you [be allowed to] come near me","12:61":"They answered, \"We will try to persuade his father to part with him, and We will do [our best]","12:62":"[Joseph] said to his servants, \"Place their merchandise in their camel-packs, so that they may recognize them when they go back to their family, and be eager to return","12:63":"When they returned to their father, [Joseph's brothers] said, \"Father, all grain will be withheld from us [in the future unless we bring Benjamin with us]. Send our brother with us, so that we may be given another measure. We will guard him carefully","12:64":"[Jacob] replied, \"Will I trust you with him in the same way I trusted you with his brother [Joseph] before? No, but God's guardianship is better [than yours]. He is the Most Merciful to those who show mercy","12:65":"When they opened their packs, they discovered that their merchandise had been returned to them, [and] they said, \"Father, what more could we desire? Here is our merchandise; it has been returned to us. [If you send Benjamin with us,] We will [again] be able to bring food for our family, and will guard our brother [well], and receive an additional camel-load of grain-an extra measure so easily achieved","12:66":"[Jacob] said, \"I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn pledge, before God, that you will bring him back to me, unless you are overwhelmed [by enemies].\" When they gave him their solemn pledge, [Jacob] said, \"God is witness to everything we say","12:67":"He added, \"My sons, do not enter [the town] through one gate, but enter through different gates. I cannot help you against the will of God. Judgment [as to what is to happen] rests with none but God. I have placed my trust in Him. Everyone who has trust [in His existence] must place their trust in Him alone.\" (:] Although they entered [the town] in the way their father had told them, it did not help them against the will of God, it merely satisfied a wish of Jacob's [to protect them]. He knew well what We had taught him, though most people do not","12:68":"When [the sons of Jacob] presented themselves before Joseph, he drew his brother [Benjamin] to himself, saying [to him in secret], \"I am your brother, so do not be saddened by their past actions","12:69":"[Later,] when he had provided them with their provisions, he placed the [king's] drinking-cup in his brother's camel-pack. As [they were leaving the town,] a watchman called out, \"People of the caravan, you are thieves","12:70":"Turning towards the man and his companions, [the brothers] asked, \"What are you missing","12:71":"They answered, \"We are missing the king's cup, and he who produces it will receive a camel-load [of grain as a reward]. I [Joseph]","12:72":"pledge myself to this [promise]","12:73":"[The brothers] said, \"By God, you must know that we have not come to commit corrupt deeds in this land, and that we have not been stealing","12:74":"[The Egyptians] said, \"What will be the penalty for this [deed] if you are [proved to be] liars","12:75":"[The brothers] replied, \"The penalty will be [the enslavement of] the person in whose bag the cup is found: this is how we punish wrongdoers","12:76":"[They were brought before Joseph to be searched, and] he began with the bags of his half-brothers before the bag of his brother [Benjamin]. In the end he produced the drinking cup from his brother's bag. In this way We schemed on Joseph's behalf-if God had not so willed, he could not have detained his brother as a penalty under the king's law. We raise the rank of whomever We will, but, above everyone who is endowed with knowledge, there is One who knows everything","12:77":"[As soon as the cup was produced from Benjamin's bag, the brothers] said, \"If he is a thief, then his brother was a thief before him.\" Joseph said to himself, without revealing his thought to them, \"You are far worse in this respect, and God is fully aware of what you are saying","12:78":"They said, \"Mighty governor, he has a father who is a very old man. Therefore, detain one of us instead. We can see that you are a very good man","12:79":"[Joseph] answered, \"May God preserve us from [the sin of] detaining anyone other than the person on whom we found our property; that would be unjust of us","12:80":"When they lost all hope of [persuading] him, they withdrew to take counsel [among themselves]. The eldest of them said, \"Do not you remember that your father took a solemn pledge from you before God, and how before that you failed with regards to Joseph? I will not depart from this land until my father gives me leave, or God passes judgment in my favor. He is the best of all judges","12:81":"[As for you others,] return to your father and say, \"Father, your son has stolen [the king's cup]. We can tell you only what we saw. How could we guard against the unforeseen","12:82":"Ask in the town we were in [at the time], and the people of the caravan that we travelled with, and [you will find that] we are telling the truth","12:83":"[When they returned to their father and told him what had happened], he said, \"No, your souls have enticed you to such a [terrible] thing. [As for me], patience in hard times is most godly. Perhaps God will bring them all [back] to me. He alone is All-Knowing, All-Wise","12:84":"He turned away from them and said, \"Alas for Joseph,\" and his eyes clouded over with grief, and he was filled with sorrow","12:85":"[His sons] said, \"By God. You will never stop remembering Joseph until you are totally broken, or are dead","12:86":"He answered, \"It is only to God that I complain of my deep grief and sorrow. I know from God something that you do not know","12:87":"My sons, go and try to obtain some news of Joseph and his brother, and do not lose hope of God's mercy. Only the unbelievers lose hope of God's life-giving mercy","12:88":"[The sons of Jacob went back to Egypt and to Joseph], and, when they presented themselves before him, they said, \"Mighty governor, hardship has afflicted us and our family, and we have brought only a little merchandise, but give us full measure [of grain] and be charitable to us. God rewards those who give in charity","12:89":"He replied, \"Do you remember what you did to Joseph and his brother when you were still ignorant","12:90":"They said, \"Could it be that you are Joseph?\" He said, \"I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God has been gracious to us. If one is mindful of Him and patient in hard times, God does not allow the reward of those who do good to be lost","12:91":"[The brothers] said, \"By God. God has certainly raised you above us, and we were sinners","12:92":"He said, \"No blame will be uttered today against you. May God forgive you for your sins. He is the Most Merciful of those who are merciful","12:93":"[Now] take this shirt of mine and lay it over my father's face, and he will recover his sight. Then come [back] to me with all of your family","12:94":"As soon as the caravan [with which Jacob's sons were travelling] was on its way, their father said [to the people around him], \"You may think I am senile, but I can smell Joseph","12:95":"They answered, \"By God, you are still lost in that old illusion of yours","12:96":"But when the bearer of good news came [with Joseph's shirt], he laid it over his face, and he regained his sight, and said, \"Did I not tell you, 'I know, from God, something that you do not know","12:97":"[His sons] answered, \"Father, ask God to forgive us our sins. We were sinners","12:98":"He said, \"I will ask my Lord to forgive you. He alone is truly forgiving, a true Purveyor of Mercy","12:99":"When they [arrived in Egypt and] presented themselves before Joseph, he drew his parent to him, saying, \"Enter Egypt. If God wills, you will be secure","12:100":"He raised his parents to the highest place of honor, and they [all] fell down before him, bowing. [Joseph] said, \"My father, this is the real meaning of my dream long ago, which my Lord has made come true. He was good to me when He freed me from the prison, and [when] He brought you [all to me] from the desert after Satan sowed discord between me and my brothers. My Lord is most subtle in achieving whatever He wills. He alone is All-Knowing, All-Wise","12:101":"My Lord, you have given me power, and have imparted to me some knowledge about the interpretation of dreams. Originator of the heavens and the earth, You are my protector in this world and in the life to come. Let me die as one who has surrendered himself to You, and allow me to join the righteous","12:102":"[Prophet], We now reveal to you this account of something that was beyond your knowledge. You were not with Joseph's brothers when they decided what they were going to do and schemed [against him]","12:103":"However eager you may be, most people will not believe [in this revelation]","12:104":"although you do not ask them for any reward for [reciting] it. It is [God's] reminder to all people","12:105":"How many signs are there in the heavens and on earth which they pass by and on which they turn their backs","12:106":"Most of them do not even believe in God without associating others with Him","12:107":"Do they have assurances that the all-enveloping punishment of God's will evade them, or that the Last Hour will not come upon them suddenly, when they least expect it","12:108":"[Prophet], Say, \"This is my way: I and all who follow me call [people] to God based on the clear insight.

And if you should follow [your people's] whims and desires after knowledge has come to you, you would not have any ally or any protector from God","13:38":"We have already sent messengers before you and assigned to them wives and descendants. No messenger came with a sign except by permission of God.

They turn others away from the path of God and make it seem irrelevant. These people have gone far astray","14:4":"Every messenger whom We have sent used his own people's language, so that he might make [the Truth] clear to them, but God lets whoever wants to stray, go astray, and guides whoever wants [to be guided]. He alone is almighty, and The Wise","14:5":"We sent Moses with Our messages: \"Lead your people out of dark ignorance into enlightenment, and remind them of the Days of God.\" In this there are messages for all who are patient and grateful","14:6":"Moses said to his people, \"Remember the grace which God gave you when He saved you from Pharaoh's people who afflicted you with cruel suffering, and slaughtered your sons, and spared [only] your women, which was a severe test from your Lord","14:7":"[Remember the time] when your Lord promised, \"If you are grateful, I will certainly give you more and more, but if you are ungrateful, My punishment will definitely be severe","14:8":"Moses added, \"[Even] if you, and whoever else lives on earth, [ever] deny the truth, God is rich beyond need, worthy of all praise","14:9":"Have you not heard of the stories of those who lived before you, the people of Noah, and of [the tribes of] Aad and Thamud, and of those who came after them, known only to God?

It makes no difference now whether we rage or endure with patience: there is no escape for us","14:22":"And when everything had been decided, Satan will say: \"God promised you the Truth. I also made promises to you, but I deceived you. I had no power at all over you, but I called you, and you responded to me. Hence, do not blame me, blame yourselves.

The word that comes out of their mouths is grievous; they say nothing but a lie","18:6":"Then perhaps you are going to worry yourself to death chasing after them, if they do not believe in this message","18:7":"We have adorned the earth with attractive things so that We may test people [as to) who will do best","18:8":"but We will [later] reduce all of it into a wasteland","18:9":"Or did you think that the fellows of the cave and [their devotion to] the scriptures were among our amazing signs","18:10":"The young men retreated to a cave and said, \"Our Lord, grant us Your mercy and help us see our way clear out of this ordeal","18:11":"So, We sealed their ears in the cave for a number of years","18:12":"Then We awakened them to know which of the two groups was better able to calculate the time they had stayed there","18:13":"We now relate to you their story in Truth. They were young people who believed in their Lord, and We deepened their understanding","18:14":"We emboldened them when they stood up [to their people] and said, \"Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. Never will we invoke any deity other than Him, for that would be a deplorable thing to do","18:15":"Our people have taken gods besides Him. Why, can they not produce any clear evidence for their beliefs? Who, then, could be more unjust than someone who makes up lies about God","18:16":"Now that you have withdrawn from them and that which they worship instead of God, take refuge in that cave. Your Lord will spread out His mercy for you and will help you find the best way out of your predicament","18:17":"And [had you been present], you would have seen the sun, when it rose, veering away from their cave towards the right, and, when it set, passing away from them to the left, while they lay within an opening of that cave. This is one of God's signs. He whom God guides is the rightly guided, but he whom God leaves to stray, you will not find for him a guiding protector","18:18":"And you would have thought that they were awake, whereas they were really asleep. And We turned them to the right side and to the left side, while their dog stretched his forelegs at the entrance. If you had looked at them, you would have turned and run away and been very afraid of them","18:19":"In time We awakened them, so they may ask one another. One of them said: \"How long have you remained here?\" They said, \"We have been here a day or part of a day.\" They said, \"Your Lord knows best how long You have been here. So send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the town and let him find the best food, and bring some back to you, but let him be cautious. And let no one be aware of you","18:20":"If they come to know, about you, they will stone you or force you to return to their religion. And then you would never succeed, ever","18:21":"It is in this way that we caused them to be found, so that people would know that the promise of God is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour [of Resurrection]. As they were arguing among themselves about them, some said, \"Build a structure over them. Their Lord knows best about them.\" But those who prevailed in the matter said: \"We will build a place of worship over them","18:22":"Some will say there were three [sleepers], the fourth one being their dog; while others will say there were five, the sixth one being their dog - Just guessing at the unknown. Still others will say there were seven, and the eighth one was their dog. Say, \"My Lord knows their number best. Very few know [the truth] about them, so do not argue about them except in relation to what is clearly known, and do not seek the opinion of any of these people about them","18:23":"Never say of anything, \"I will do that tomorrow","18:24":"without adding, \"God willing.\" And whenever you forget, remember your Lord and say, \"I pray that my Lord will guide me closer to what is right","18:25":"And they remained in their cave for three hundred years plus an additional nine","18:26":"Say, \"God knows best how long they remained. All that is beyond our senses, in the heavens and on the earth belongs to Him. How perfectly He sees, and how perfectly He Hears! They have no protector besides Him, and He does not share His rule with anyone","18:27":"Recite what has been revealed to you from your Lord's Book. No one can change His words, and you will never find any refuge except with Him","18:28":"And patiently stay with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His approval. And let not your eyes turn away from them, desiring worldly attractions. Do not obey anyone whose heart We have made oblivious of Our remembrance, who follows his own whims and desires, and who abandons all that is good","18:29":"And say, \"The Truth is from your Lord. Whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him deny the truth.\" We have prepared a fire for the unjust whose walls will surround them. And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like molten brass, which scalds their faces. Terrible is that drink, and evil is that resting place","18:30":"As for those who have believed and done righteous deeds - We do not let the reward - of anyone who does a good deed go to waste","18:31":"They will have Gardens of Eden; beneath them rivers will flow. They will be adorned with bracelets of gold, and will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade, and recline on couches. What an excellent reward, and what a wonderful resting place","18:32":"And present to them the parable of two men. To one of them, We gave two gardens of grapevines, and surrounded them with palm trees, and placed fields of crops between them","18:33":"Each of the two gardens produced its fruit and did not fall short in anything. And We made a gushing river flow right through them","18:34":"And he had plenty of fruit, so he said to his neighbor while conversing with him, \"I am greater than you in wealth and mightier in [numbers of] men","18:35":"He entered his garden and did himself harm by saying: \"I do not think that this will ever perish","18:36":"And neither do I think that the Hour will come. But even if I should be brought back to my Lord, I will surely get something better in return","18:37":"His neighbor said to him in the course of the conversation: \"Have you no faith in Him who created you from dust, and then from a fertilized ovum and then shaped you into a man","18:38":"As for me, He is my Lord, and I don't associate anyone with my Lord","18:39":"if only, you had said, when you entered your garden, 'It is all God's will; there is no power except in God'? Although you see me possessing less than you in wealth and children","18:40":"it may well be that my Lord will give me something better than your garden and send down on it thunderbolts from the sky so that it becomes a heap of barren dust","18:41":"or its water sinks deep into the ground, so that you will never be able to attain it","18:42":"And [thus it happened]: his fruitful garden was surrounded [by ruin], and there he was, wringing his hands in grief over what he had spent on it, while it had collapsed upon its trellises. He said, \"Oh, I wish I had not associated anyone with my Lord","18:43":"for now there was no one other than God to help him, nor could he help himself","18:44":"Thus it is, all protection there belongs to God, the Truth. He gives the best reward and the best outcome","18:45":"Cite for them the parable of the life of this world, it is like water that We send down from the sky and is absorbed by the plants of the earth. But in time it becomes dry chaff, scattered by the winds. And it is God who has absolute power over all things","18:46":"Wealth and children are adornments of this worldly life, but the enduring good deeds produce a greater reward from your Lord and a better hope","18:47":"On the Day We will set the mountains in motion, and you see the earth emerging, and We will gather them all, leaving not a single one behind","18:48":"They will be lined up before your Lord, [and He will say] \"You have come to Us just as We created you in the first instance. Even though you claimed that We will not make such an appointment for you","18:49":"And the Book [of deeds] will be laid [open], and you will see those who forced others to reject God's messages filled with dread at what is in it, and they will say, \"Alas for us! What a record is this! It leaves out no deeds, small or great, but accounts for it!\" They will find everything they ever did present [before them]. Your Lord will not be unjust to anyone","18:50":"And [mention] when We told the angels, \"Prostrate yourselves before Adam,\" and they all prostrated themselves, except for Iblis. He was of the jinn, but he disobeyed his Lord's command. Do you [seriously consider] choosing him and his descendants as allies instead of Me, when they are your enemies? How despicable a bargain this is for the unjust","18:51":"I did not make them witness to the creation of the heavens and earth, nor to their own creation, and neither do I have any need to take those who lead others astray as my helpers","18:52":"And [warn of] the Day when He will say, \"Call 'My partners' whom you claimed,\" and they [the unjust] will call on them, but they [the partners] will not respond to them, for we shall place an unbridgeable divide between them","18:53":"And those who forced others to reject Our messages will see the Fire, and they will know that they are bound to fall into it, and they will not find any escape from it","18:54":"We have mentioned in this Qur'an all kind of examples for the benefit of people, but, more than anything else, man is argumentative","18:55":"Now that guidance has come to them, What could it be that is preventing people from believing or from asking their Lord for forgiveness, other than that the fate of earlier generations has not yet befallen them, or the punishment has not yet come upon them","18:56":"We sent Our message-bearers only to bring good news and to give warning, yet the unbelievers seek to refute the Truth with false arguments and mock My signs and warnings","18:57":"And who is more unjust than one who is reminded of his Lord's messages but turns away from them, forgetting what he has done? We have placed veils over their hearts, lest they understand, and deafness in their ears. If you ask them to be guided, they will never be guided","18:58":"Yet your Lord is the Most-Forgiving and full of mercy. Were He to take them to task for what they deserved, He would have hastened their punishment. Rather, they have an appointed time from which they will never find an escape","18:59":"as [was the case with] those communities that We destroyed when they did wrong: We made an appointed time for their destruction","18:60":"Recall when Moses said to his servant, \"I will not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas, even if I must press on for years","18:61":"But when they reached the junction where the two seas meet, they forgot their fish, which made its way into the sea and swam away","18:62":"So when they had moved on, [Moses] said to his servant, \"Bring us our lunch. We have certainly suffered hardship on this journey","18:63":"He [the servant] said, \"Remember when we rested by the rock? I forgot the fish there. And it was Satan who made me forget to pay attention to it. And amazingly, it found its way into the sea","18:64":"[Moses] said, \"That is what we were seeking.\" So they returned, following their own footprints","18:65":"There, they found one of Our servants, whom We had blessed with mercy from Us, and unto whom We had imparted knowledge of our Own","18:66":"Moses said to him, \"May I follow you, so that you will teach me some of the right guidance You have been taught","18:67":"He said, \"You will not be able to wait patiently with me","18:68":"for how can you have patience for what you do not understand","18:69":"[Moses] said, \"You will find me, God willing, patient, and I will not disobey you in [any] way","18:70":"He said, \"Then if you follow me, do not ask me about anything until I mention it to you","18:71":"So they set out, until, when they had embarked on the ship, the man made a hole in it. [Moses] said \"Did you knock a hole in it to drown its passengers? You have certainly done a dreadful thing","18:72":"The man said, \"Didn't I tell you that you would not be able to wait patiently with me","18:73":"[Moses] said, \"Forgive me for forgetting, and don't be too harsh with me","18:74":"So they set out, until they met a boy, whom the man killed. [Moses] said, \"You killed an innocent soul who never killed anyone. You have certainly done a deplorable thing","18:75":"The man said, \"Didn't I tell you that you would not be able to wait patiently with me","18:76":"[Moses] said, \"If I should ask you about anything after this, then you should no longer let me accompany you. You have a good excuse not to put up with me","18:77":"So they set out, until they reached the inhabitants of a town and they asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they found a wall about to collapse, so the man restored it. [Moses] said, \"If you wished, you could have been paid for [fixing] it","18:78":"He said, \"This is where you and I will part company. I will tell you the interpretation of what you could not wait for patiently","18:79":"As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working at sea. I damaged it because there was a king after them who seized every [good] ship by force","18:80":"And as for the boy, his parents were believers, and we had reasons to fear that he would cause them extreme distress by transgression and unbelief","18:81":"So, we wished that their Lord would give them a son better in purity and closer to mercy","18:82":"As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys [living] in town, and there was a treasure beneath it belonging to them. Their father was a righteous man. So your Lord intended that they reach maturity and then to unearth their treasure as a mercy from your Lord. And I did not do [any of this] of my own accord. This is the interpretation of what you were not able to wait for patiently","18:83":"And they ask you, about the Zul-Qarnayn [Two-Horned One]. Say: \"I will tell you something about him","18:84":"We gave him power and authority on earth, and We gave him a way to achieve anything","18:85":"So he chose a way","18:86":"until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it [as if] setting in a dark, muddy spring, and nearby he found some people. We said, \"O Zul-Qarnayn, either cause [them] to suffer or treat them with kindness","18:87":"He said, \"We will punish the unjust. Then he will return to his Lord, and He will punish him with unspeakable suffering","18:88":"But as for the one who believes and does righteousness, he will have the best of rewards. We shall require him to do only easy things","18:89":"Then he followed a path","18:90":"until he came to the rising of the sun. He found it rising on a people for whom We had provided no shade","18:91":"And so it was, Our knowledge encompassed all that happened to him","18:92":"Then he followed a path","18:93":"until he reached a pass between two mountains, where he found a people who could hardly understand a word he was saying","18:94":"They said, \"O Zul-Qarnayn, Gog and Magog are corrupting this land. Can we pay you to erect a barrier between us and them","18:95":"He said, \"What my Lord has given me is better [than any compensation]. Just give me a strong helping hand and I will build a solid barrier between you and them","18:96":"Bring me chunks of iron.\" When he had filled in [the gap] between the two mountain-sides, he said, \"Blow!\" When he had made [the iron] as red hot as fire, he said, \"Bring me molten copper to pour over it","18:97":"So [Gog and Magog] were able neither to scale the barrier, nor were they able to pierce it","18:98":"He said, \"This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord comes, He will crush it [the barrier]. The promise of my Lord is surely true","18:99":"And on that Day We will let them surge like waves over each other, and [then] the Horn will be blown, and We will gather them all together","18:100":"On that Day We shall display Hell plainly to the unbelievers","18:101":"those whose eyes had been veiled from My message, and who could not hear it","18:102":"Do those who have denied the truth think that they can take My servants as protectors instead of Me? We have prepared Hell for the unbelievers as their lodging place","18:103":"Say, \"Shall we tell you who are the most failing in whatever they do","18:104":"They are those whose efforts are lost in worldly pursuits, while they think that they are doing good work","18:105":"Those are the ones who deny the signs of their Lord and deny that they will meet Him. Their actions will come to nothing and on the Day of Resurrection they will be of no consequence","18:106":"Hell is their recompense for having denied the truth, and ridiculed My signs and My Messengers","18:107":"Those who have believed and done righteous deeds will have Paradise for their lodging","18:108":"where they will abide eternally, never wishing to leave","18:109":"Say, \"If the sea were ink for [writing] the words of my Lord, the sea would run out long before the words of my Lord ran out, even if We were to add another sea to it","18:110":"Say, \"I am only a man like you, to whom has been revealed that your god is one God. So, whoever looks forward with hope to meet his Lord, let him do righteous deeds and in the worship of his Lord not associate anyone with Him","19:1":"Kaf Ha Ya 'Ayn Sad","19:2":"Recount your Lord's mercy on His servant Zechariah","19:3":"When he called to His Lord silently","19:4":"he said, \"My Lord, my bones have weakened, and my head shimmers with grey hair, but never, Lord, have I failed to be blessed in praying to you","19:5":"And I fear what my kinsfolk [will do] after I am gone. My wife has been barren, so give me an heir as a gift from You","19:6":"one who will receive my inheritance and he will be an heir to the family of Jacob. And make him, my Lord, pleasing to You","19:7":"O Zechariah, We bring you good news of a son whose name will be John, a name We have never given to anyone else before","19:8":"[Zechariah] said, \"My Lord, how will I have a son when my wife has been barren and I have reached advanced old age","19:9":"He said, \"It will be so. Your Lord says: 'It is easy for Me, for I created you before, when you were nothing","19:10":"[Zechariah] said, \"My Lord, give me a sign.\" He said, \"Your sign is that you will not speak to people for three full nights","19:11":"So he came out from the sanctuary and signaled his people to glorify [God] in the morning and in the evening","19:12":"John, take hold of the Book with steadfastness.\" And We gave him wisdom [while he was still] a boy","19:13":"as well as affection from Us and purity, and he was always mindful of Us","19:14":"and full of kindness towards his parents, and he was not domineering or rebellious","19:15":"[God's] peace was upon him on the day he was born and the day of his death, and it will be upon him on the day he is raised alive","19:16":"Mention in the Book the story of Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east","19:17":"and secluded herself from them. We then sent to her Our Spirit, who appeared to her in the shape of a perfect human being","19:18":"She said, \"I seek refuge from you in the Merciful, [leave me alone] if you are God fearing","19:19":"He said, \"I am only the Messenger of your Lord, [who says,] 'I will give you a son endowed with purity","19:20":"She said, \"How can I have a son when no man has touched me and I have not been a promiscuous woman","19:21":"He said, \"It will be so. Your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to people and a mercy from Us. The matter is already determined","19:22":"So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote place","19:23":"Then the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, \"Oh, I wish I had been dead and forgotten before all this","19:24":"But a voice called to her from below, \"Do not grieve; your Lord has provided a stream beneath you","19:25":"Shake the trunk of the palm tree toward you; it will drop ripe, fresh dates to you","19:26":"So eat and drink and be satisfied and say to anyone you may see, I have made a vow of silence to the Lord of Mercy and I will not talk to anyone today","19:27":"Then she went back to her people, carrying him. They said, \"Mary, you have done an unthinkable thing","19:28":"Sister of Aaron, your father was not a bad man, nor was your mother a loose woman","19:29":"She pointed to him. They said, \"How can we speak to a child in the cradle","19:30":"[Jesus] said, \"I am the servant of God. He has given me the Book and made me a prophet","19:31":"And He has made me blessed wherever I am and directed me to pray and to give charitable gifts as long as I live","19:32":"and to be full of kindness toward .mother, and He has not made me domineering or rebellious","19:33":"And [God's] peace was upon me the day I was born and the day I will die and it will be upon me the day I am raised alive","19:34":"Such is Jesus, the son of Mary - the Word of Truth about which they are in dispute","19:35":"It does not befit God to have a son; may He be exalted in His glory! When He decides on something, He simply says to it, \"Be!\" and it is","19:36":"[Jesus continued]: \"God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. That is a straight path","19:37":"Then, the sects differed among themselves [concerning the nature of Jesus], so woe to those who reject the truth when they witness that awesome Day","19:38":"How [clearly] they will hear and see on the Day they will come before Us. Today, however, they are in clear error","19:39":"Warn them of the Day of Regret, when everything will have been decided; and [yet], they are heedless, and they do not believe","19:40":"It is We who will inherit the earth and all those on it, and to Us they will be returned","19:41":"And mention in the Book [the story of] Abraham. He was a man of truth and a prophet","19:42":"He said to his father, \"O my father, why do you worship that which does not hear and does not see and will not benefit you at all","19:43":"Father, I have received knowledge which has not come to you, so follow me; I will guide you to an even path","19:44":"O my father, do not worship Satan. Satan was disobedient to the Merciful","19:45":"Father, I fear that a punishment from the Merciful will afflict you so that you will be Satan's companion [in Hell]","19:46":"[His father] said, \"Are you forsaking my gods, Abraham? If you do not stop this, I will surely stone you. Now get away from me and don't come back","19:47":"He said, \"Peace be upon you. I will ask my Lord to forgive you. He is always gracious to me","19:48":"and I will leave you and those you call upon other than God and will call upon my Lord. Perhaps in calling on my Lord, I will be blessed","19:49":"So when he had left them and those they worshipped other than God, We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and each [of them] We made a prophet","19:50":"And We endowed them with Our mercy, and we made them highly honored","19:51":"And mention in the Book, Moses. He was sincere, and he was a messenger and a prophet","19:52":"We called out to him from the right hand side of the mount and We brought him near to Us in close communication","19:53":"and out of Our mercy We gave him his brother Aaron as a prophet","19:54":"And mention in the Book, Ishmael. He was true to his promise, and he was a messenger and a prophet","19:55":"He used to order his people to pray and to give the purifying alms and he found favor with His Lord","19:56":"And mention in the Book, Enoch (Idris) He was a man of truth and a prophet","19:57":"and We raised him to a high position","19:58":"These are some of the prophets whom God has blessed- from among the descendants of Adam, and those We carried with Noah, and the descendants of Abraham and Israel, and those whom We guided and chose. When the verses of the Merciful were recited to them, they fell down prostrating and weeping","19:59":"But they were succeeded by generations who neglected prayer and pursued their own desires so they will meet with utter disillusionment","19:60":"except for those who repent, believe and do righteous deeds; they will enter Paradise and will not be wronged in any way","19:61":"[They will be in] the Gardens of Eden which the Merciful has promised His worshipers in a realm which is beyond the reach of human perception. His promise will be fulfilled","19:62":"There they will hear no ill speech - only [greetings of] peace - and there they will have their provisions, morning and evening","19:63":"Such is Paradise, which We give as an inheritance to those of Our worshipers who were ever mindful of God","19:64":"And [the angels said], \"We descend only at your Lord's command. To Him belongs what is before us and behind us and in between. And your Lord is never forgetful","19:65":"[He is] Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them - so worship Him and persevere in His worship. Do you know of anyone equal to Him","19:66":"Yet the human being continues to ask, \"When I am dead, will I then be brought out alive again","19:67":"Does the human being not remember that We created him before, when he was nothing","19:68":"So by your Lord, We will surely round them up along with the devils, and then We will bring them around Hell on their knees","19:69":"Then from every sect, We will drag out those who were the most defiant towards the Merciful","19:70":"Surely, We know best who most deserves the fire of Hell","19:71":"And all of you will go through it. This is a decree from your Lord that must be fulfilled","19:72":"Then We will save those who were mindful of God and leave the unjust on their knees","19:73":"And when Our verses, which are perfectly clear, are recited to them, the unbelievers say to those who believe, \"Which of [our] two parties is in the better position and enjoys superior influence","19:74":"And yet how many generations have We destroyed before them who surpassed them in possessions and [outward] appearance","19:75":"Say, \"As for him who is lost, let the Merciful-to-all lengthen the span of his days until they see what they were promised, punishment either [in this world] or at the Hour [of Judgment]. Then they will clearly see who is worse in possessions and who has the weaker forces","19:76":"To those rightly guided, God increases guidance, and the good deeds that will last are those that are deemed best and most rewarding in your Lord's sight","19:77":"Have you considered the man who denies the truth of Our signs and says, \"I will surely be given wealth and children","19:78":"Has he received extrasensory knowledge, or has he received a pledge from the Merciful","19:79":"No! We will record what he says and extend the duration of his punishment","19:80":"And We will inherit from him the things he's talks about, and he will come to Us alone","19:81":"And they have taken gods other than God, hoping that they would be [a source of] strength for them","19:82":"No! Those deities will reject their worship and will even turn against them","19:83":"Do you not see that We have sent the devils to the unbelievers, inciting them to sin","19:84":"So do not try to expedite their punishment. We are simply counting down the number of their days","19:85":"On the Day [of Judgment,] We will gather all the righteous as [an honored] delegation to the Merciful","19:86":"and will drive those who forced others to reject Our messages to Hell like a thirsty herd","19:87":"None will have [power to] intercede on their behalf except him who has received permission from the Merciful","19:88":"And they say, \"The Merciful-to-all has taken [for Himself] a son","19:89":"You have done an atrocious thing","19:90":"It almost causes the heavens to rupture, the earth to split open and the mountains to collapse in devastation","19:91":"that they attribute a son to the Merciful","19:92":"It does not befit the Merciful to take a son","19:93":"There is no one in the heavens and earth who will not come as a servant to the Merciful","19:94":"He has numbered them and counted them precisely","19:95":"so that every one of them will appear alone before Him on the Day of Resurrection","19:96":"The Merciful-to-all will bestow His affection on those who have believed and done righteous deeds","19:97":"And We have made [this Qur'an] easy to recite [Prophet] so that you may give good news to the righteous and warning to stubborn people","19:98":"How many generations have We destroyed before them? Do you see any one of them or even hear from them even a whisper","20:1":"Ta Ha","20:2":"We have not sent down the Qur'an for you to be distressed","20:3":"but only as a reminder to all who stand in awe [of God]","20:4":"a revelation that was sent down gradually from Him who created the earth and highest heavens","20:5":"the Merciful-to-all [who is] established on the throne of His majesty","20:6":"To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is on the earth, and what is between them, and what is beneath the soil","20:7":"Whether or not you speak aloud, He knows what is secret as well as what is [even] more hidden","20:8":"God there is no god except Him. All the attributes of perfection belong to Him","20:9":"And has the story of Moses reached you","20:10":"When he saw a fire and said to his family, \"Wait here. I can see a fire; perhaps I will bring you a piece of it, or maybe I will find guidance there","20:11":"But when he came to the fire, he was called, \"Moses","20:12":"I am truly your Lord, so remove your sandals. You are in the sacred valley of Tuwa","20:13":"and I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed","20:14":"Verily, I am God. There is no God except Me, so worship Me and establish prayer to remember Me","20:15":"The Hour [of Judgment] is coming- though I have chosen to obscure it-when every soul may be rewarded according to its deeds","20:16":"Do not let your focus be diverted from it by anyone who does not believe in its coming and follows his own whim, lest you perish","20:17":"[God said] and what is that in your right hand, Moses","20:18":"It is my staff; I lean upon it, I bring down leaves for my sheep and I have other uses for it","20:19":"[God said,] \"Throw it down, Moses","20:20":"So he threw it down, and-behold- it turned into a snake, moving swiftly","20:21":"[God] said, \"Pick it up and do not be afraid; We will return it to its former condition","20:22":"Now draw your hand to your side; it will come out white, unharmed - another sign","20:23":"so that We may show you [some] of Our greater signs","20:24":"Go to Pharaoh. He has transgressed all bounds","20:25":"[Moses] said, \"My Lord, put my heart at ease","20:26":"and ease my task for me","20:27":"and untie the knot from my tongue","20:28":"so that they may understand my speech","20:29":"and appoint for me a minister from my family","20:30":"Aaron, my brother","20:31":"Increase my strength through him","20:32":"and let him share my task","20:33":"so that we may glorify You much","20:34":"and remember You much","20:35":"You see and know all about us","20:36":"[God] said, \"You have been granted your request, Moses","20:37":"And We have already favored you in a previous time","20:38":"when We inspired your mother with this","20:39":"Put him into the chest and cast it into the river. Let the river wash it to the bank, where he will be taken by an enemy of Mine and his.\" And I bestowed upon you My love, so that you would be brought up under My watchful eye","20:40":"Then your sister walked by and said, \"Shall I direct you to someone who will take care of him?\" We returned you to your mother, so that she could rejoice and not grieve. Later, you killed someone, but We rescued you from distress but put you through other severe tests. And you remained some years among the people of Midian. Then you came [here] as I ordained, Moses","20:41":"And I have chosen you for Myself","20:42":"Go, you and your brother, with My signs and do not falter in remembering Me","20:43":"Go, both of you, to Pharaoh. He has overstepped all My limits","20:44":"And speak to him gently that perhaps he may remember or fear [God]","20:45":"They said, \"Our Lord, we are afraid that He will quickly do us harm or that he will overstep all boundaries","20:46":"God said, \"Fear not. I am with you both; I hear and I see","20:47":"Go to him and tell him: \"We are messengers of your Lord, so send the Children of Israel with us, and do not punish them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord. And peace will be upon him who follows His guidance","20:48":"It has been revealed to us that punishment will come upon whoever rejects the truth and turns away","20:49":"[Pharaoh] said, \"So who is the Lord of you two, Moses","20:50":"He said, \"Our Lord is He who gave each thing its form and then guided [it]","20:51":"[Pharaoh] said, \"Then what about the former generations","20:52":"He said, \"Their knowledge is with my Lord in a record. My Lord neither errs nor forgets","20:53":"It is He who has made the earth as a cradle for you and traced pathways for you through it and sent down rain from the sky, with which We bring forth various kinds of plants","20:54":"to eat as well as pasture for your cattle. In this there are signs for intelligent beings","20:55":"From earth We created you, and to it We will return you, and from it We will bring you forth once again","20:56":"We certainly showed Pharaoh all of Our signs, but he denied [them] and refused [to believe]","20:57":"[Pharaoh] said, \"Have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic, Moses","20:58":"Then we will surely bring you magic like it. So let's set a time that neither [of us] will fail to keep in a mutually agreed-upon place","20:59":"[Moses] said, \"Your appointment is on the day of the festival, when the people assemble at mid-morning","20:60":"So Pharaoh turned away, decided on his scheme, and then he returned","20:61":"Moses said to the magicians summoned by Pharaoh, \"Beware! Do not invent lies against God or He will afflict you with a grievous punishment. He who lies shall fail","20:62":"So [the magicians] argued among themselves over their plan but kept their conversation secret","20:63":"They said, \"these are two magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and to abolish your most exemplary way of life","20:64":"So gather your resources and line up for the contest. And whoever succeeds today will prosper","20:65":"They said, \"Moses, either you throw, or we will be the first to throw","20:66":"He said, \"No, you throw.\" And, behold! Their ropes and staffs seemed to him from their sorcery to move [like snakes]","20:67":"Moses felt fear within himself","20:68":"but, God said, \"Have no fear. You will have the upper hand","20:69":"And throw what is in your right hand; it will swallow up what they have crafted, for what they have crafted is a magician's trick, and the magician will not succeed in whatever he tries","20:70":"[So it was, and] the magicians, fell down in prostration. They said, \"We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses","20:71":"[Pharaoh] said, \"How dare you believe him before I gave you permission? He must be your leader who has taught you magic. So I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and you will surely know which of us is more severe in punishment and more enduring","20:72":"They said, \"Never will we prefer you over the clear proof that has come to us as nor [over] Him who created us. So, decree whatever you will. You can decree only for this worldly life","20:73":"We have believed in our Lord, so that He may forgive us our sins and the magic that you forced us to perform. God is better and more enduring","20:74":"Whoever comes to his Lord as an evildoer is destined for Hell where he will neither die nor live","20:75":"But whoever comes to Him as a believer, having done righteous deeds will be the highest ranks and","20:76":"Gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow, where they will dwell eternally. And that is the reward for one who purifies himself","20:77":"We revealed to Moses, \"Travel by night with My worshipers and strike a dry path through the sea for them, and do not fear being overtaken [by Pharaoh] or fear [drowning]","20:78":"So Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, and they were utterly overwhelmed by the sea","20:79":"Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide [them]","20:80":"O Children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and We made a covenant with you on the right side of the mountain, and We repeatedly sent down manna and quail to you","20:81":"[saying], \"Eat from the good things which We have provided you, but do not abuse them or I will be angry with you. And he with whom I am angry will certainly fall","20:82":"Yet I am most forgiving towards those who repent, believe, do righteous deeds, and stay on the right path","20:83":"[God] said, \"Moses, what made you come in such haste ahead of your people","20:84":"He said, \"They are following closely upon my heels, and I rushed to You, my Lord, so that You might be pleased","20:85":"[God] said, \"But We have tested your people after you [departed], and the Samaritan has led them astray","20:86":"So Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved. He said, \"My people, did not your Lord make you a gracious promise? Did the fulfillment [of the covenant] seem too long to you, or did you want the anger of the Lord to fall on you, so you broke your promise to me","20:87":"They said, \"We did not break our promise to you deliberately, but we were weighed down with the heavy burden of the people's jewelry so we threw them [into the fire], following what the Samaritan did","20:88":"The Samaritan made them [a statue of] a calf, which had a lowing sound, so they said [to each other) , \"This is your god and the god of Moses, but he has forgotten [his past]","20:89":"Did they not see that it did not respond to them and that it had no power to either harm or benefit them","20:90":"Aaron had already told them before [the return of Moses], \"My people, you are only being tested by it, and your Lord is the Merciful-to-all, so follow me and obey my order","20:91":"They said, \"We will never cease being devoted to the calf until Moses returns to us","20:92":"[Moses] said, \"Aaron, what prevented you, when you saw them going astray","20:93":"from following me? Have you then disobeyed my order","20:94":"[Aaron] said, \"Son of my mother, do not seize [me] by my beard or by my head. I feared that you would say, You caused division among the Children of Israel, and you did not remember my words","20:95":"[Moses] said, \"And what is the matter with you Samaritan","20:96":"He said, \"I gained insight into what they did not see, so I took a handful [of dust] from the messenger's track and threw it in. This is what my soul tempted me to do","20:97":"[Moses] said, \"Get out of here. All that you can ask for in this life is not to be physically harmed. But you have an appointment [in the Hereafter] you will not fail to keep. Look at your 'god' to which you remained devoted. We will burn it up and we will scatter its dust into the sea","20:98":"[People] your true god is God; there is no god but Him. His knowledge encompasses all things","20:99":"In this way We tell you [Prophet] the news of what has happened before, and We have given you a Reminder directly from Us","20:100":"Whoever turns away from it will bear a heavy burden on the Day of Resurrection","20:101":"carrying it eternally. What a terrible burden to carry on the Day of Resurrection","20:102":"On that Day the Horn will be blown and We will gather those who force others to reject Our messages, blinded [with terror]","20:103":"and they will whisper to each other, \"You have spent only ten [days]","20:104":"We know best what they will say when the most perceptive [among them] will say, \"[In fact] you have spent only one day","20:105":"And [should] they ask you [Prophet] about the mountains, say, \"My Lord will blow them away into dust","20:106":"and He will level them into empty plains","20:107":"where you will not see a dip or an elevation","20:108":"On that Day, everyone will follow the Caller from whom there is no escape. Then, all voices will be quieted before the Merciful-to-all and only whispers will be heard","20:109":"On that Day, no intercession will be of value except from one to whom the Merciful-to-all has given permission and was pleased with his speech","20:110":"God knows what is before them and what will be after them, but they cannot contain Him with their knowledge","20:111":"And [on that day all] faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. And he who bears injustice will despair","20:112":"But he who does righteous deeds while he is a believer he will fear neither injustice nor deprivation","20:113":"And thus We have sent down [this revelation] as a perfect Arabic Qur'an and have given warnings that perhaps they will remain mindful of Us, or that it might give them a new awareness","20:114":"Know then, that God, the Ultimate Sovereign, the Ultimate Truth is So exalted. [Prophet] do not rush ahead with the Qur'an before its revelation to you is complete, and say, \"My Lord, increase me in knowledge","20:115":"And We had already made a covenant with Adam, but he forgot [it]; and We found him lacking in steadfastness","20:116":"And [mention] when We said to the angels, \"Bow down before Adam,\" and they bowed, except Iblis; he refused","20:117":"So We said, \"O Adam, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. Do not let him drive you out of the Garden and make you suffer","20:118":"In the Garden you will never go hungry or go naked","20:119":"nor will you go thirsty or suffer the heat of the sun","20:120":"Then Satan whispered to him, saying, \"Adam, shall I show you the tree of immortality and a kingdom that will never decay","20:121":"And they both ate from it, so that their nakedness became apparent to them, and they began to cover themselves with the leaves from the Garden. Adam disobeyed his Lord and was led astray","20:122":"But later, his Lord chose to bring him closer, accepted his repentance, and guided him","20:123":"[God] said, \"Go down from it, all of you, as enemies to one another. But when guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray [in this world] nor suffer [in the Hereafter]","20:124":"But whoever turns away from remembering Me, he will have a life of great hardship, and We will raise him blind on the Day of Resurrection","20:125":"He will say, \"My Lord, why have you raised me blind whereas I was able to see before","20:126":"[God] will say, \"Just as Our Signs came to you and you forgot them, in the same way, you too will this Day will be forgotten","20:127":"This is how We repay him who goes too far and does not believe in the signs of his Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more enduring","20:128":"Has it not become clear to them how many generations We destroyed before them, in whose ruined dwellings they now walk? There are signs in this for those with understanding","20:129":"And were it not for a prior word from your Lord, setting an appointed term, [their punishment] would necessarily have come immediately","20:130":"So [Prophet] be patient with what they say and exalt your Lord's limitless glory and praise Him before the rising of the sun and before its setting; and exalt His limitless glory during periods of the night and the day, so that you may be content","20:131":"And do not gaze longingly toward what We have given some of them to enjoy, [it is merely] the splendor of worldly life by which We test them, but the provision of your Lord is better and more enduring","20:132":"Order your people to pray and be steadfast yourself. We are not asking you for provision; We provide for you, and the [best] end [comes through] being mindful of God","20:133":"And they say, \"If he would only bring us a sign from his Lord?\" Has not clear evidence come to them in the earlier texts","20:134":"And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before this, they would have said, \"Our Lord, if You had only sent us a messenger, we could have followed Your signs before we were humiliated and disgraced","20:135":"Say, \"Each is expectantly waiting; so wait with your expectations. For you will eventually know who is on the path of equity and who is rightly guided","21:1":"People's reckoning draws closer, but they turn away without paying any attention","21:2":"Every time a new message comes to them from their Lord, they listen to it while they play","21:3":"with their hearts distracted. Those bent on wrongdoing conceal their private conversation, [saying], \"Is he not [Muhammad] just a man like you? Do you succumb to magic with your eyes wide open","21:4":"He said, \"My Lord knows whatever is said throughout the heaven and earth, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-knowing","21:5":"But they continue to quibble, \"These [revelations] are only confused dreams,\" or, \"He has just invented it,\" or, \"He is merely a poet.\" \"So [they say] let him bring us a sign like those who were sent previously","21:6":"We destroyed the communities before them who did not believe, so will they believe","21:7":"Those We have sent before you were only men whom We inspired. So, tell those who deny the truth: \"if you do not know this, ask the people of earlier revelations","21:8":"And We did not give the prophets bodies that did not eat food, nor were they immortal","21:9":"Then We fulfilled Our promise to them and We saved those We willed, and destroyed those who exceeded all bounds","21:10":"We have sent down to you a Book containing all that you ought to bear in mind. Will you not reason, then","21:11":"And how many communities of unjust people have We destroyed, raising up other people in their place","21:12":"When they felt the might of Our punishment, they fled at once","21:13":"Do not flee, but return to the life of luxury you enjoyed and to your homes, so that you may be questioned","21:14":"They said, \"Woe to us! we were truly wrongdoers","21:15":"And that cry of theirs did not cease until We made them like stubble, silent and still","21:16":"We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in play","21:17":"had We wished for amusement, We could have found it within Ourselves- had We so willed","21:18":"Instead, We hurl the Truth after falsehood, and the Truth destroys it, and it withers away. But woe to you for all your [attempts to] define [God]","21:19":"To Him belongs everything in the heavens and on earth. And those near Him are never too proud to worship Him, nor do they tire [of doing so]","21:20":"They exalt His limitless glory day and night, [and] do not grow weary","21:21":"Or have they taken for themselves earthly gods who resurrect the dead","21:22":"Had there been in heaven or on earth any deities other than God, they would both be ruined. But exalted be God in His limitless glory, Lord of the Throne, Who is far above anything they describe","21:23":"He will not be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned","21:24":"Or have they taken gods besides Him? Say, \"Produce your proof. This is the message for those with me and the message of those before me.\" But most of them do not know the Truth, so they turn away","21:25":"We never sent any messenger before you [Prophet] without revealing to him that \"There is no god except Me, so worship Me","21:26":"And yet, some say, \"The Merciful-to-all has taken a son!\" May He be exalted in His glory! \" No! They are only His honored worshipers","21:27":"They do not speak before He does, and they act only on His command","21:28":"He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they cannot intercede [for anyone] except with His approval, as they are in reverent awe of Him","21:29":"Where any of them say, \"I am a god besides Him\"- that one We would repay with Hell. This is how We repay the transgressors","21:30":"Are the unbelievers not aware that the heavens and the earth were one mass before We separated them and made every living thing from water? Will they not believe, then","21:31":"And We placed within the earth firmly set mountains, lest it should shake with them, and We made valleys, as roadways as roadways that they might be guided [through them]","21:32":"and We made the sky a protected roof, yet still, they turn away from its signs","21:33":"And It is He who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon; each floating in its orbit","21:34":"[Prophet] We did not grant immortality to any human being before you; so if you die, would they live forever","21:35":"Every soul is bound to taste death. We test you with evil and with good as a trial and to Us you will all return","21:36":"And when the unbelievers see you, they laugh at you, [saying], \"Is this the one who keeps talking about your gods?\" Yet when the Merciful-to-all is mentioned, they reject Him","21:37":"The human being is a creature of haste. I will show you My signs soon, so do not ask Me to show them sooner","21:38":"And they say, \"When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are telling the truth","21:39":"If the unbelievers only knew the time when they will not be able to divert the Fire from their faces or from their backs, and they will find no help","21:40":"Rather, it will come to them unexpectedly and bewilder them, and they will not be able to repel it, nor will they be reprieved","21:41":"Messengers before you were also mocked, but those who mocked them were overwhelmed by the very thing they mocked","21:42":"Say, \"Who can protect you by night or day from the Merciful-to-all?\" Yet they turn away when their Lord is mentioned","21:43":"Or, do they have gods to defend them from Us? They are unable [even] to help themselves, nor can they be protected from Us","21:44":"We have allowed these people and their fathers to enjoy life for a long time, until life seemed long and good to them. Do they not see how We come upon the land, eroding it from its extremities? Will they prevail then","21:45":"Say: \"I can only warn you through Revelation,\" but the deaf cannot hear the call when they are warned","21:46":"Yet, if but a whiff of your Lord's punishment should touch them, they would surely say, \"Woe to us! We have been unjust","21:47":"And We place the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so that no soul will be wronged in the least for though there be [only] the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth. It suffices that We will do the reckoning","21:48":"And We gave Moses and Aaron the Furqan [a standard by which to judge right from wrong] a light and a reminder for those who are ever mindful of God","21:49":"those who stand in awe of their Lord, though He is unseen, and who fear the Hour","21:50":"And this [Qur'an] too is a blessed message that We have sent down. Will you then ignore it","21:51":"Before [Moses] We gave Abraham sound judgment and We knew him well","21:52":"when he said to his father and his people, \"What are these statues to which you are devoted","21:53":"They said, \"We found our fathers worshipping them","21:54":"He said, \"You and your fathers have obviously gone astray","21:55":"They said, \"Have you come to us with the Truth, or are you playing games","21:56":"He said, \"[No], rather, your Lord, who created them, is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and I am a witness to that","21:57":"And, by God, I will surely plot against your idols after You have turned your backs and gone away","21:58":"So he broke them into pieces, except for the largest one among them, so that they might return to it [and question]","21:59":"They said, \"Who has done this to our gods? He is unjust","21:60":"Some said, \"We heard a young man mention them; they call him Abraham","21:61":"They said, \"Then bring him before the eyes of the people, so that they may be witnesses","21:62":"They said, \"Have you done this to our gods, Abraham","21:63":"He said, \"Rather, this one, the largest of them, did it, so ask them, if they are able to speak","21:64":"So they turned on one another, saying, \"It is you who are the unjust","21:65":"Then, they reversed themselves, [saying], \"You [Abraham] knew that these [idols] do not speak","21:66":"He said, \"Then do you worship what does not help or harm you at all instead of God","21:67":"Shame on you, and shame on what you worship instead of God. Will you not use reason then","21:68":"They said, \"Burn him and support your gods-if you are to act","21:69":"But We said, \"Fire, be coolness and peace for Abraham","21:70":"And they intended to harm him, but We made them the greatest losers","21:71":"And We delivered him and Lot to the land which We had blessed for all people","21:72":"And We gave him Isaac and Jacob as an additional gift, and all [of them] We made righteous","21:73":"We made them leaders guiding others by Our command. And We inspired them to do good deeds, to establish prayer, and to give the purifying alms; they were our true worshippers","21:74":"And to Lot We gave sound judgment and knowledge, and We saved him from the town that was committing wicked deeds. They were evil, perverse people","21:75":"And We admitted him into Our mercy. He was of the righteous","21:76":"Long before that, We answered Noah when he called to Us, so We responded to him, and saved him and his family from the great calamity","21:77":"And We helped him against the people who denied Our signs. They were an evil people, so We drowned them, all together","21:78":"And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment concerning the field into which some people's sheep had strayed [at night]. We were witness to their judgment","21:79":"and We gave understanding of the case to Solomon, and to each [of them] We gave sound judgment and knowledge. And We caused the mountains and the birds to join David in extolling Our limitless glory, for We are able to do [all things]","21:80":"And We taught him to fashion coats of armor to protect you from your [enemy in] battle. But are you grateful","21:81":"And to Solomon We subjected the wind, which aped at his command toward the land that We had blessed. It is We who have knowledge of everything","21:82":"And among the [devils] rebellious creatures, who dove into the sea for him and did other work, but it was We who kept watch over them","21:83":"And [mention] Job, when he cried to his Lord, \"Great harm has afflicted me, and you are the Most Merciful of the Merciful","21:84":"So We responded to him and removed the harm that afflicted him. And We restored his family and their like with them, as a mercy from Us and a reminder for God's worshippers","21:85":"And [mention] Ishmael and Idris and Dhul-Kifl; all were all steadfast","21:86":"And We admitted them into Our mercy for they were truly righteous","21:87":"And [Jonah] Zun-nun, when he went off in anger and thought that We would not punish him. Then he called out from the deep darkness, \"There is no God except You; May You be exalted in Your glory. I have been among the unjust","21:88":"We responded to him and saved him from his grief. This is how We save the believers","21:89":"And Zechariah, when he called to his Lord, \"My Lord, do not leave me childless, for you are the best of heirs","21:90":"We responded to him, gave him John, and healed his wife for him. They were always eager to do good deeds, calling out to Us in hope and fear, and they humbled themselves before Us","21:91":"And [mention Mary] the one who guarded her chastity. We breathed into her from Our Spirit, and made her and her son a sign for all people","21:92":"This is your community, a single community [of believers], and I am your Lord, so worship Me","21:93":"And [yet], they later disagreed and became divided, [but] they are all destined to return to Us","21:94":"So whoever does righteous deeds while he is a believer -his effort will not be ignored, and We shall record it in his favor","21:95":"No community that We have destroyed can possibly return","21:96":"until Gog and Magog are let loose and they rush down from the heights","21:97":"Then, the true promise will approach and the eyes of the unbelievers will stare [in horror, while they say], \"Woe to us; we were oblivious to this; rather, we were unjust","21:98":"You and what you worship other than God are the firewood of Hell. You will be coming to it","21:99":"Had these [false deities] been [actual] gods, they would not have come to it, but each one of them will stay there [in Hell] forever","21:100":"In it they will be wailing and they will not be able to hear","21:101":"As for those for whom We have decreed the best [reward]-they will be kept far removed from Hell","21:102":"They will not hear its sound, while they abide eternally in whatever their souls desire","21:103":"They will not be grieved by the greatest horror and the angels will greet them, [saying], \"This is your Day which you have been promised","21:104":"the Day when We will roll up the heavens as one rolls up a written scroll.

And We settle in the womb what We wish for a specified term, then We bring you forth as an infant, and then you may grow to reach maturity. And among you some will die, and some will reach the most decrepit age in which he no longer knows what he once knew. You see the earth barren, yet when We send down rain, it shakes and swells and produces every kind of beautiful plant","22:6":"That is because God is the Ultimate Truth and because He alone brings the dead to life and because He is competent over all things","22:7":"And [that they may know] that the Hour is coming; no doubt about it, and that God will resurrect all those in the graves","22:8":"Yet among men there is he who argues about God without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening Book","22:9":"turning away [from the truth] in his arrogance to lead [people] astray from the path of God. For him there is only disgrace in the world, and We will make him taste the punishment of the burning fire on the Day of Resurrection","22:10":"[He will be told] \"This is for what you have done. God is never unfair to His servants","22:11":"And among people you would find one who worships God with shaky faith. If good befalls him, he is reassured by it; but if he is tested, he reverts to his old ways, [thereby] losing both [this] world and the next. That is a manifest loss","22:12":"Instead of God, he calls upon what can neither harm him nor benefit him. That is the ultimate misguidance","22:13":"He calls on one who is more likely to harm than to benefit [him]. How miserable are both the protector and the companion","22:14":"But God will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to Gardens with rivers flowing through them. God does what He wills","22:15":"Anyone who thinks that God will not help him [the Prophet] in this world and in the Hereafter, let him find a way to reach out to heaven, then try to make headway, and see if his scheme will eliminate what enrages him","22:16":"And thus have We sent the Qur'an down as verses of clear evidence for God guides those who want to be guided","22:17":"As for those who believed, the Jews, the Sabeans, the Christians, the Magians and those ascribing divinity to other than God-God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. God witnesses all thing","22:18":"Do you not see that everyone in the heavens and everyone on earth and the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the moving creatures and many human beings bow down before God? But for many others their punishment is justified and he who is disgraced by God cannot have his honor restored by anyone. God does whatever He wills","22:19":"These are two adversaries who have disputed over their Lord. But the unbelievers will have cut out garments of fire cut out for them, and boiling water will be poured over their heads","22:20":"which will melt the contents of their bellies as well as their skin","22:21":"and they shall be held by iron grips","22:22":"Every time they try to escape [the fire) of it in their anguish, they will be returned to it, and [it will be said], \"Taste the punishment of the Burning Fire","22:23":"As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, God will admit them to Gardens with rivers flowing through them. They will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments will be silk","22:24":"for they were [willing to be] guided [in this life] to speak the best words, and so they were guided to the path that leads to Him Who is Worthy of [all] Praise","22:25":"As for the unbelievers who divert [others] from the path of God and [from] the Sacred House, which We made for all People equally-[both] those who dwell there, and those who come from abroad - We will let those who desire to profane it with wrongdoing taste a painful punishment","22:26":"For when We showed Abraham the site of the House, [We told him], \"Do not associate anything with Me and purify My House for those who will circle around it, and those who stand to pray and those who bow down and prostrate themselves","22:27":"And proclaim the Pilgrimage to all people: they will come to you on foot and on every kind of swift and lean mount, through distant passes","22:28":"so that they may receive benefits for themselves and to celebrate God's name on appointed days. He has provided [sacrificial] animals for their purposes. So eat of them and feed the miserable and poor","22:29":"So let the pilgrims perform their acts of purification and fulfill their vows. And then circle around the Ancient House","22:30":"All of that [has been commanded]. As for anyone who honors the sacred ordinances of God, it is good for him in the sight of his Lord. Livestock have been permitted to you, except what has been explicitly forbidden. So turn away from the filth of idols, and turn away from telling lies","22:31":"inclining [only] to God, not associating [anything] with Him. And he who associates others with God- it is as though he had fallen from the sky and was snatched by the birds or the wind carried him down into a remote place","22:32":"Thus it is; and whoever venerates the sacred rites of God-[their acts] proceed from a pious heart","22:33":"You have benefits in these animals marked for sacrifice for a specified time; then, their place of sacrifice is at the Ancient House","22:34":"We have appointed a rite [of sacrifice] for every nation, so that they may mention the name of God over whatever [sacrificial] animals He has provided them. Your god is one God, so submit to Him. And, give good news to the humble of heart","22:35":"those whose hearts tremble when God is mentioned, and those who patiently persevere over what has afflicted them, and those who perform prayer and those who spend from what We have provided them","22:36":"We have appointed sacrificial animals for you among the rituals of God. There is much good for you in them, so mention God's name over them when they lined up [for sacrifice], and, when they are [lifeless] on their sides, then eat from them and feed the needy and the beggar. Thus We have subjected them to you so that hopefully you may be grateful","22:37":"It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Good: what reaches Him is your piety. Thus He has made them subject to you, so that you may glorify God for having guided you. And give good news to those who do their best at whatever they do","22:38":"God will defend the believers. God does not like the treacherous and ungrateful","22:39":"Permission [to fight] has been given to those against whom war is being waged wrongfully, because they were wronged. And God is surely capable of giving them victory","22:40":"[They are] those who have been driven from their homes unjustly, for saying only that \"Our Lord is God.\" And, if God did not intervene by using some people to drive out others, many monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, where God's name is much remembered, would have been destroyed. God is sure to help those who help His cause, for truly God is strong and mighty","22:41":"[And they are] those who, if We give them authority in the land, establish prayer, and give the purifying alms, and order what is obviously right, and forbid what is obviously wrong. And to God belongs the outcome of [all] matters","22:42":"And if they deny you [Prophet], so, did the people of Noah and Aad and Thamud deny [their prophets]","22:43":"as did the people of Abraham and the people of Lot","22:44":"and the inhabitants of Midian. And Moses was called a liar. So, I indulged the unbelievers for a time, and then I seized them, and how [terrible] was My reproach","22:45":"And how many a town did We destroy while it was committing wrong, so It is [now] fallen into ruin, and [how many] an abandoned well, and [how many] a lofty palace","22:46":"Have they not traveled through the land, so that their hearts gain wisdom and their ears learn to listen? For it is not the eyes that are blind, but the hearts within the breasts","22:47":"They challenge you [Prophet] to bring on their punishment [if you can]. But God will never fail to deliver His promise. A day with your Lord is like a thousand years as you count them","22:48":"And how many a community did I indulge while it was unjust? Then I seized it, and their [final] destination is up to Me","22:49":"Say [Prophet) , \"O People, I am sent only to deliver a clear warning to you","22:50":"And those who have believed and done righteous deeds - for them is forgiveness and generous rewards","22:51":"But those who oppose Our message, [seeking] in vain to cause it to fail-those are the companions of Hell","22:52":"Yet, whenever We sent a messenger or a prophet ahead of you, and he was hoping [that his warning will be headed], Satan would cast [doubt] on his hopes. But God destroys that what Satan insinuates, and God confirms His messages, for God is All-Knowing and All-Wise","22:53":"He makes what Satan spews forth a temptation only to those whose hearts are sick or hardened-surely the unjust are profoundly opposed to the Truth","22:54":"So that those who have been given knowledge may understand that it is the Truth from your Lord and believe in Him, while their hearts humbly submit to Him. God will guide the believers to a straight path","22:55":"but the unbelievers will continue to be in doubt about it until the Hour comes suddenly on them, or punishment strikes them on the Day of desolation","22:56":"[All] sovereignty on that Day will belong to God; He will judge between them. So, those who believed and did righteous deeds will be in the Gardens of Delight","22:57":"While the unbelievers and those who reject Our signs will receive a humiliating punishment","22:58":"And those who emigrated for the cause of God and then were killed or died-God will surely provide for them handsomely, for God is surely the best of providers","22:59":"He will surely admit them into a place that well pleases them, for God is All-Knowing and Forbearing","22:60":"That [is so]; and whoever responds [to an act of aggression] only with an equivalent force and is then wronged again, God will surely help him. God is pardoning and forgiving","22:61":"Thus it is, because God merges the night into day and merges the day into night, and because God is All-Hearing and All-Seeing","22:62":"Thus it is, because God is the Ultimate Truth, and anything they call upon other than Him is falsehood, because God is the Most High, the Most Great","22:63":"Do you not see that God has sent down rain from the sky, and then the earth becomes green? God is Most-Subtle, All-Aware","22:64":"To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth, God is the Rich Beyond Need; the Praiseworthy","22:65":"Do you not see that God has made everything on the earth of service to you-including the ships that run through the sea by His command- and that He prevents heaven from falling on the earth without His permission? God is most compassionate and most Merciful-to-all people","22:66":"He is the One Who gave you life, and then will causes you to die, and then will bring you back to life. Human being however is ungrateful","22:67":"We have appointed acts of worship for every nation, which they [are to] observe. So, let the unbelievers not contend with you over the matter, but invite them to your Lord. You are on the straight path","22:68":"and if they argue with you, then say, \"God knows best what you are doing","22:69":"On the Day of Resurrection, God will judge between you regarding your differences","22:70":"Do you not know that God knows what is in the heaven and earth? All this is written in a Record. This is easy for God","22:71":"Nevertheless, they worship others besides God, something for which He has granted no authority, and about which they have no knowledge. There will not be any helper for the unjust","22:72":"And when Our verses are recited to them as clear evidence, you will detect disapproval in the faces of the unbelievers. They all but assault those who recite Our verses. Say, \"Shall I inform you of [what is] worse than that? [It is] the Fire that God has promised the unbelievers. How miserable is their destination","22:73":"People, an example is presented, so listen to it. Those you call on besides God will never be able to create [as much as] a fly, even if they all gathered together for that purpose. And if the fly robs them of anything, they will not be able to retrieve it. How feeble are the petitioners and those they petition","22:74":"They do not give God His due esteem. God is omnipotent, almighty","22:75":"God chooses messengers from among the angels and people. God is All-Hearing and All- Seeing","22:76":"He knows what lies before them and what is behind them, for all matters will go back to God","22:77":"Believers: bow, and prostrate, and worship your Lord and do good, so that you may succeed","22:78":"And strive for God as He deserves. He has chosen you and has not imposed hardships on you in religion- the faith of your father, Abraham. He named you \"Muslims\" [submitters] before [in former Books] and in this [revelation], so that the Messenger may be a witness over you, and you may be witnesses over other human beings. So, perform prayer, and give the purifying alms and hold fast to God. He is your protector, and how excellent is this protector, how excellent this helper","23:1":"The believers have prospered","23:2":"They are those who humble themselves in prayer","23:3":"who turn away from meaningless talk","23:4":"pay the purifying alms","23:5":"and who protect their chastity","23:6":"except with their wives or with those whom their right hands held in trust, for which they will not be blamed","23:7":"Those who desire anything beyond that are transgressors","23:8":"whereas those who honor their trusts and their promises","23:9":"and who keep up their prayers","23:10":"those are the inheritors","23:11":"who will inherit the Paradise of Ferdous, where they will dwell for eternity","23:12":"And We did certainly create man from an extract of clay","23:13":"and then We placed him as a fertilized ovum in a safe place","23:14":"and then We transformed the fertilized ovum into a clinging leach, and the leach into a chewed morsel, and [from] the chewed morsel, We created bones, and We covered the bones with flesh, and then we structured him into yet another creation. Blessed is God, the best of creators","23:15":"Then, after that, you will surely die","23:16":"Then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will be resurrected","23:17":"And We have created above you seven heavenly dimensions, and We have never abandoned [Our] creation","23:18":"And We have sent down rain from the sky in a measured amount and we settle it into the earth, [although] We have the power to withdraw it","23:19":"With [water] We bring forth gardens of palm trees, and vines with abundant fruit for you, from which you may eat","23:20":"and a tree growing out of Mount Sinai that produces oil and relish for those who eat","23:21":"And there is a lesson for you in livestock, we give you milk to drink from their bellies, [you derive] numerous other benefits from them: you eat [their meat]","23:22":"We sent Noah to his people, and he said, \"My people, worship God; you have no gods before Him. Will you not be aware of Him","23:23":"and ride upon them as you do on ships","23:24":"But their leaders, who were among the unbelievers from his people said, \"He is but a human being like you, trying to gain dominance over you; if God had so willed, He would have sent down angels. We have never heard of anything like this from our forefathers","23:25":"He is only a man possessed, so put up with him for a while, and let's see what happens to him","23:26":"[Noah] said, \"My Lord, help me, because they have accused me of lying","23:27":"So We instructed him, \"Build the Ark under Our watchful eyes and [according to] Our revelation.

Will you not, then, be aware of Him","23:33":"But the leaders among his people, who denied the truth and denied the encounter with the Hereafter, and to whom We had given ease and plenty in this worldly, life said, \"This is only a man like you, who eats what you eat and drinks what you drink","23:34":"and, if you should obey a human being like yourselves, you would then fail","23:35":"Does he promise you that when you have died and become dust and bones that you will be brought forth [to a new life]","23:36":"What You have been promised is sheer nonsense","23:37":"Life is only our worldly life: we live and die, but we will not be resurrected","23:38":"He is just a man who has invented a lie about God, and We will never believe him","23:39":"He said, \"My Lord, help me because they call me a liar","23:40":"[God] said, \"After a little while, they will surely regret [what they have said]","23:41":"So the blast justly struck them, and We swept them away like scum. Away then with the oppressive people","23:42":"After them, We gave rise to new generations","23:43":"No community can speed up or hold back its appointed destiny","23:44":"Then We sent Our Messengers in succession. Whenever a messenger came to a community he was invariably rejected, so We destroyed them one after the other, until they became mere tales. Away, then, with the people who do not believe","23:45":"Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a clear authority","23:46":"to Pharaoh and his inner circle, but they were an arrogant, haughty people","23:47":"They said, \"Should we believe two human beings like us while their people are serving us","23:48":"So they called them both liars, and were consequently destroyed","23:49":"And We gave Moses the Book so that they might be guided","23:50":"And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and sheltered them within a hill where there was a meadow and a flowing spring","23:51":"[God said], \"O Messengers, eat good things and do good.

No, but they are oblivious [to what is going on]","23:57":"Those who stand in awe of their Lord","23:58":"who believe in the messages of their Lord","23:59":"who do not associate anything with their Lord","23:60":"and who give whatever they can while their hearts tremble at the thought that they will be returning to their Lord","23:61":"these are the ones who vie to do good deeds, and they will be the first to attain them","23:62":"We do not burden any soul with more than it can bear. There is a record with Us which speaks the Truth and they will not be treated unjustly","23:63":"However, the [unbelievers'] hearts are in confusion about this [message], and they do even do worse deeds","23:64":"until We bring those corrupted with opulence for punishment. Only then will they suddenly start crying [to God] for help","23:65":"Do not cry out today. You will not get any help from Us","23:66":"For [every time] My verses were recited to you, you turned away from them","23:67":"in arrogance, amusing yourself by talking nonsense about them far into the night","23:68":"Have they not thought about what We tell them, or has something come to them that did not come to their forefathers","23:69":"Or do they not recognize their messenger? Is that why they do not acknowledge him","23:70":"Or do they say, \"He is crazy?\" when in fact he brought them the Truth. But most of them hate the Truth","23:71":"If the Truth conformed to their desires, truly, the heavens, and the earth, and whoever is in them would have been corrupted. Instead, We have given them their Reminder, but they turn away from it","23:72":"Or [do they think that] you are asking them for compensation, when your Lord's compensation is best? He is the Best of Providers","23:73":"You call them to a straight path","23:74":"but those who do not believe in the Hereafter deviate from that path","23:75":"Even if We were to show them mercy and relieve them of the harm afflicting them, they would persist in their blind transgression","23:76":"Even when We afflicted them with suffering [as a warning], they did not humble themselves to their Lord, nor were they submissive","23:77":"but when We open a gate of severe punishment to them, they will immediately be crushed with despair","23:78":"And it is He who created your hearing and vision and hearts; how seldom are you grateful","23:79":"And it is He who spread you over the earth, and to Him you will be gathered","23:80":"And It is He Who gives life and causes death, and to Him is due the alternation of night and day.

He was one of those who spread corruption","28:5":"But, We wanted to favor those who were oppressed in the land, and make them leaders and make them inheritors of the land","28:6":"and to empower them and show Pharaoh, Haman and their soldiers through them the very thing that they feared","28:7":"So, We inspired Moses' mother, \"Nurse him for now; but when you fear for his safety, put him into the river; do not be afraid and do not grieve. We will return him to you and will make him a messenger","28:8":"And Pharaoh's people picked him up, to become later an enemy to them and a source of grief, [since] Pharaoh and Haman and their soldiers were sinners","28:9":"Pharaoh's wife said, \"He will be a delight for my eyes and yours. Do not kill him; He may be useful to us, or we may adopt him as a son.\" They did not realize [the consequences of] what was going on","28:10":"[Later] Moses' mother felt her heart totally empty. She was about to disclose the matter had We not strengthened her heart that she would be counted among the believers","28:11":"And she said to his sister, \"Follow him,\" so she watched him from a distance without being noticed","28:12":"And We made him reject all wet nurses, so she said, \"Shall I tell you about a household that will feed him for you and be good to him","28:13":"And We returned him to his mother so that she might delight her eyes with him, not grieve and know that God's promise is true. But most people do not know","28:14":"And when he attained his full strength and maturity, We gave him judgment and knowledge. And thus We reward those who do of good","28:15":"[One day] he entered the town unnoticed and found two men fighting, one from his own people and the other from his enemy. The one from his own people cried out to him for help against the enemy, so Moses struck him and killed him. [Moses] said, \"This must be from Satan's doing. He is clearly an enemy who clearly leads [people] astray","28:16":"He said, \"My Lord, I have done wrong. Please forgive me,\" and He forgave him. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful-to-all","28:17":"[Moses] said, \"My Lord, with all of Your blessings to me, I will never support those who do evil","28:18":"Next morning, he entered the town, fearful and anxious, when suddenly the man who sought his help the previous day cried out to him again for help. Moses said to him, \"You are clearly a troublemaker","28:19":"As [Moses] was about to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them, [the man] said, \"Moses, do you want to kill me as you killed that man yesterday? You want only to be an oppressor in the land and do not want to put things right","28:20":"And a man came from the far end of the town, running. He said, \"Moses, they are talking about killing you, so leave; I am giving you a good advice","28:21":"So [Moses] left the town, fearful and on his guard. He said, \"My Lord, save me from these oppressive people","28:22":"And as he made his way toward Midian, he was saying, \"Perhaps my Lord will guide me in the right way","28:23":"When he came to the well of Midian, he found there a crowd of people watering [their flocks], and beside them he found two women holding back their flocks. He said, \"What is going on?\" They said, \"We cannot water until the shepherds take their flocks away, and our father is an old man","28:24":"So he watered their flocks for them. Then he went back to the shade and said, \"My Lord, I am very much in need for whatever good You might send down to me","28:25":"Then, one of the two women came walking toward him shyly and said, \"My father would like to pay you for having watered [our flock] for us.\" So when Moses came to him and told him his story, he said, \"Don't be afraid. You have escaped from those oppressive people","28:26":"One of the women said, \"Father, hire him. A strong and the trustworthy man is the best that you can hire","28:27":"He said, \"I want to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you, on [condition] that you work for me for eight full years; but if you complete ten, it will be seen [as a favor] from you. I do not wish to make things difficult for you. You will find me to be, God willing, a fair man","28:28":"[Moses] said, \"That is a deal between us. Whichever of the two terms I complete, there should be no bad feelings toward me. May God be Witness over what we say","28:29":"When Moses completed the term and was traveling with his family, he noticed a fire from the direction of the mountain. He said to his family, \"Stay here, I have seen a fire. Perhaps I will bring you from there [some] information or burning wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves","28:30":"But when he came to the fire, a voice called from the right side of the valley from the tree on the blessed spot, \"Moses, I am God, Lord of the worlds","28:31":"Throw down your staff.\" But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he fled in fear and would not return. \"Moses [he was called again], comeback and do not be afraid. You are one of those who are safe","28:32":"Insert your hand in your garment; it will come out white, but unharmed. And hug your arms to your sides to still your fear, for those are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his inner circle. They have been defiant and disobedient people","28:33":"He said, \"My Lord, I killed one of them, and I fear they will kill me","28:34":"My brother Aaron can speak better than I, so send him with me to support me and confirm my words. I fear they will call me a liar","28:35":"[God] said, \"We will strengthen you through your brother and We shall give you both power so that they cannot touch you. With our signs, you and those who follow you will be victorious","28:36":"But when Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said, \"This is only false magic. We have not heard of this from our forefathers","28:37":"Moses said, \"My Lord knows best who has come with guidance from Him and whose end will be best in the Hereafter. Those who are unjust do not succeed","28:38":"Pharaoh said, \"Counselors, I have not known you to have a god other than Me. Haman, light me a fire to bake clay, and then build me a tower that I may climb up to Moses' God. I think he's a liar","28:39":"He and his soldiers behaved arrogantly in the land, as they did not know the Truth, and they thought that they would not return to Us","28:40":"So, We took him and his soldiers and threw them into the sea. See what became of the unjust","28:41":"We made them leaders calling [others] to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will receive no help","28:42":"And We pursued them with a curse in this world, and, on the Day of Resurrection, they will be among the despised","28:43":"After We had destroyed the earlier generations, We gave Moses the Book as enlightenment to the people, and as guidance and mercy so that they might be reminded","28:44":"You [Prophet], were not on the western side [of the mount] when We gave Our command to Moses, and you were not a witness","28:45":"But We produced [many] generations [after Moses], and life dragged on for them. You were not dwelling among the people of Midian, reciting Our verses to them, but We have always sent messages to people","28:46":"Nor were you on the side of the mount when We called [Moses], but [you were sent] as a mercy from your Lord to warn a people to whom no messenger had come before, so that they might be reminded","28:47":"that if a disaster should strike them for what they have done, they would not be able to say, \"Our Lord, if You had only sent a messenger to us so we could have followed Your instructions and became believers","28:48":"But even when the Truth came to them from Us, they said, \"Why Was [the Prophet] not given signs like those given to Moses?\" Did they not previously deny what Moses was given? They said, \"[These are just] two magicians supporting each other, and we are denying each of them","28:49":"Say, \"If you are truthful, then bring a Book from God that gives better guidance than either of them that I may follow it","28:50":"But if they do not respond to you, then know that they are only following their whims and desires. And who is more lost than one who follows his own whims and desires without guidance from God? God does not guide unjust people","28:51":"We have continuously conveyed the Word to them that they might take heed","28:52":"Those to whom We gave the Book before [are bound to] believe it","28:53":"When it is recited to them, they say, \"We believe in it. It is the Truth from our Lord. We had devoted ourselves to God even before this came to us","28:54":"They will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured, and [because] they ward off evil with good, and give from what we have provided for them","28:55":"When they hear worthless talk, they turn away from it and say, \"We have our deeds, and you have your deeds. Peace be with you; we do not seek the company of the ignorant","28:56":"You [Prophet] cannot guide [to the Truth] whom you love, but God guides him who wants to be guided. And He knows best those who are guided","28:57":"They say, \"If we were to follow the guidance with you, we would be torn from our land.\" Have we not established for them a safe sanctuary, to which are brought all kind of fruits, as provisions from Us? But most of them do not understand","28:58":"How many towns have We destroyed which lived in ease and plenty but were ungrateful? Here are their dwellings, virtually uninhabited since their time. We have inherited them","28:59":"Your Lord never destroys cities unless He [first] sends a messenger in their midst reciting Our verses, nor would We destroy cities unless their inhabitants were evil","28:60":"[People] whatever you are given is only for the [passing] enjoyment and vanity of this life, but what is with God is better and more lasting.

[No], they are not equal","32:19":"As for those who believed and did good deeds, there will be Gardens of Refuge for them as an accommodation for what they have done","32:20":"But as for those who defiantly disobeyed, their refuge is the Fire. Every time they want to get out of it, they will be returned to it, while being told, \"Taste the punishment of the Fire which you used to deny","32:21":"However, We will first let them taste a lesser punishment [on earth] prior to the greater punishment, so that perhaps they may return [to the right path]","32:22":"Who is more unjust than one who is reminded of the signs of his Lord and then turns away from them?

God knows what is in your hearts, for God is All-Knowing and Forbearing","33:52":"Beyond that, it is not permitted to you to take any additional women, nor to exchange them for other wives, even if their beauty were to please you, except those from among your own slaves. God is Watchful over all things","33:53":"Believers, do not enter the Prophet's houses for a meal except when you are invited, and do not linger, waiting for the food to be ready; but when you are invited, then enter, and, when you have eaten, leave, and do not stay around to chat. That [behavior] troubles the Prophet, and he may be shy about [dismissing] you, but God is not shy about [telling you] the truth. And when you ask [his wives] for something, ask them from behind a partition; that is purer for your hearts and theirs. You are not permitted to offend the Messenger of God or to marry his wives after him, ever; that would be a huge offense in God's site","33:54":"Whatever you reveal or conceal, God knows all things","33:55":"Women are not to blame if they are seen by their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons or their women [servants], or their slaves, if they are mindful of God, for God is the Witness over all things","33:56":"God and His angels bless the Prophet, so, believers, bless him and give yourselves up in total submission [to his message]","33:57":"Those who insult God and His Messenger, God rejects them in this world and the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment","33:58":"And those who unjustifiably harm believing men and women will bear the guilt of slander and clear wrongdoing","33:59":"Prophet, tell your wives, your daughters and the believers' women to bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments.

He is the All-Wise, the All-Aware","34:2":"He knows what goes into the earth and what comes out of it, and what comes down from the heaven and what goes up into it. He is the Mercy-Giver, the Forgiving","34:3":"The unbelievers say, \"The Hour of Judgment will never come to us.\" Say [Prophet], \"Yes by God, it will surely come to you. [God is] the Knower of all that is beyond our knowledge.\" Not even an atom's weight within the heavens or within the earth escapes His knowledge, nor anything smaller or larger than that.

If We wanted, We could cause the earth to swallow them or let fragments from the sky fall down on them. There is a sign in that for every worshiper who turns back to God in repentance","34:10":"We gave David great favors from Us: \"Mountains, repeat [Our] praises with him, and the birds [as well].\" And We made iron pliable for him","34:11":"[instructing him to], \"Make full coats of mail, measuring the links carefully.

I am aware of everything you do","34:12":"And [We subjected] the wind to Solomon; its morning course [covered] a month's journey, and its evening course [covered] a month's journey. And We made a fountain of molten copper flow for him. And among the jinn were those who worked for him with his Lord's permission, and whoever among them deviated from Our command, We will make him taste of the punishment of the Blazing flame","34:13":"They made him whatever he wanted: high arches and statues, bowls like reservoirs, and firmly anchored kettles. [We said], \"Work in gratitude, family of David, for few of My worshipers are grateful","34:14":"And when We decreed Solomon's death, nothing indicated his death to the jinn except an earthworm eating his staff, but, when he fell down, it became clear to the jinn that, had they known the reality which was beyond their knowledge, they would not have remained in humiliating punishment","34:15":"There was a sign [of God's grace] for the people of Sheba in their homeland: two gardens one on the right and one on the left.

God is the [final] destination","35:19":"The blind and the seeing are not equal","35:20":"nor are ignorance and enlightenment","35:21":"nor shade and heat","35:22":"nor are the living and the dead alike. God can make anyone He wills hear, but you cannot make those in the grave hear","35:23":"You are only a warner","35:24":"We have sent you with the Truth as a bearer of good news and a warner, for there is no community to which a warner has not come","35:25":"If they reject you, those before them also rejected the truth. Their messengers came to them with clear signs and Psalms and with the enlightening Book","35:26":"Then I seized the ones who denied the truth, and how [terrible] was My punishment","35:27":"Don't you see that God sends down rain from the sky, with which We produce fruits of varying colors, [just as] in the mountains there are layers, white and red of varying shades, and some extremely black","35:28":"Similarly, among people, animals, and livestock there are also many hues. Of all of his worshipers, only those with knowledge, are in awe of God. God is Almighty, most forgiving","35:29":"Those who recite the Book of God, and perform prayer and spend out [on charity] from what We have provided them, secretly and openly, may expect a trade that will never perish","35:30":"for He may give them their full rewards and increase for them out of His bounty. He is ever-forgiving and ever-thankful","35:31":"What We revealed to you of the Book, is the very Truth, confirming what is available to you of previous revelations. God is All-Aware of His worshipers, and All-Seeing","35:32":"We then bestowed this Book as an inheritance on those of our worshipers whom We selected; and among them are some who wrong their own souls, some are moderate, and some who, by God's grace, are foremost in good deeds. That is the greatest favor","35:33":"for they will enter Gardens of Eden, where they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls, and where their garments will be silk","35:34":"They will say, \"Praise be to God, who has removed all our sorrow from us, for Our Lord is truly ever-forgiving and ever-thankful","35:35":"It is He who has settled us in the everlasting Home out of His favor, where no weariness or fatigue will touch us","35:36":"But the unbelievers will be in Hell, where they will neither be finished off and die, nor will they be relieved from Hell's punishment. That is how we reward everyone who is ungrateful","35:37":"They will cry out loud, \"Our Lord, let us out; We will do good deeds, different from what we were doing before!\" \"But didn't We give you sufficient time so that those who would be mindful could be mindful? And we even sent you the warner. Taste, then, [the punishment], for the unjust will have no helper","35:38":"God knows all the unknown of the heavens and earth; He knows what is in the hearts","35:39":"It is He who has put you in charge of the earth. Whoever denies the truth will bear the consequences. Their denial will increase their rejection in the sight of their Lord, and their denial will only increase their loss","35:40":"Say, \"Have you considered your 'partners' whom you invoke besides God? Show me what part of earth they have created, or do they have a partnership [with Him] in the heavens? Or have We given them a Book that has clear evidence? [No indeed]; Rather, the unjust promise each other nothing but delusion","35:41":"God upholds the heavens and the earth lest they fall apart, and, should they fall apart, no one other than He could hold them [in place], for He is forbearing and most forgiving","35:42":"They swore by God their most solemn oaths that, if a warning came to them, they would be better guided than any one of the previous communities. But, when a warner did come to them, they only turned further away","35:43":"because of their arrogance on earth and their evil schemes. Yet evil schemes overwhelm only those who plot them. Do they expect anything different, given what happened to earlier people? You will never find any change in the way of God, and you will never find any deviation in the His way","35:44":"Have they not traveled through the land and observed the final fate of those who preceded them, who were even greater than they in strength? Nothing in the heavens or earth will prevent God from accomplishing His purpose, for He is All-Knowing, infinite in His power","35:45":"Were God to take people to task for what they have earned, He would not leave any creature on the earth, but He defers them for a specified time. Then when their time comes, God sees all that is in [the hearts of] His worshipers","36:1":"Ya Seen","36:2":"by the wise Qur'an","36:3":"you are one of the messengers","36:4":"on a straight path","36:5":"This revelation has been gradually sent down from the Almighty, the Merciful","36:6":"to warn a people whose forefathers were not warned, so they are unaware","36:7":"[However], the word [of God] is bound to come true for most of them, for they will not believe","36:8":"We have put shackles round their necks, reaching to their chins, so that their heads are forced up","36:9":"and We have put a barrier before them and behind them, and have blindfolded them, so that they cannot see","36:10":"It is all the same to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they won't believe","36:11":"You can only warn someone who follows the message and stands in awe of the Merciful-to-all even though He is beyond his perception. So give him good news of forgiveness and a generous reward","36:12":"It is We who bring the dead to life, and record what they have done and the results of their deeds. We account for everything in a clear record","36:13":"Give them the example of the people whose town was visited by the messengers","36:14":"We sent two to them, but they rejected both, so We reinforced them with a third, and they declared, \"We are messengers to you","36:15":"They replied, \"You are only human beings like us, and the Merciful-to-all has not revealed a thing. You are only telling lies","36:16":"They said, \"Our Lord knows that we are messengers to you","36:17":"and we are responsible only for delivering [the message] clearly","36:18":"They said, \"We feel that you are an evil omen. If you do not stop, We will surely stone you, and cause you to suffer severely","36:19":"They said, \"Your evil omen is upon you. How can it be evil that you were reminded [about God]? You are rather going too far","36:20":"Then a man came running from the farthest end of the town, saying, \"O, my people, follow the Messengers","36:21":"Follow those who do not ask you for [any] payment; they are [rightly] guided","36:22":"Why should I not worship the One who brought me into being and gave me a purpose and to whom you will be returned","36:23":"Would I take any gods other than Him? if the Merciful intends me some harm, their intercession will not help me at all, nor can they save me","36:24":"I would then be clearly misguided","36:25":"I have believed in your Lord, so listen to me","36:26":"It was said [to him], \"Enter Paradise.\" He said, \"I wish that my people only knew","36:27":"how my Lord has forgiven me and placed me among the highly honored","36:28":"After him, We did not send any host from heaven to his people, nor would We send one down","36:29":"It was only one shout, and immediately they were extinguished","36:30":"Alas for our servants. Whenever a messenger comes to them, they ridicule him","36:31":"Have they not considered how many generations We destroyed before them, none of whom will ever come back to them","36:32":"Yet each and every one of them will be brought before Us","36:33":"A sign for them is the dead land that We have brought to life; from it We have brought forth grain, from which they eat","36:34":"And We have placed gardens of palm trees and grapevines in it, and caused springs of water to burst from it","36:35":"so that they may eat its fruit. It was not their hands that produced it, will they not be grateful","36:36":"Exalted in His glory is He who created pairs out of whatever the earth produces, as well as from themselves and from other things unknown to them","36:37":"Night is a sign for them. We remove the daylight from it, so they are [left] in darkness","36:38":"and the sun runs its course toward its destined point. Such is the determination of the Almighty, the All-Knowing","36:39":"And the moon, We have determined it's phases, until it finally appears like the old date-palm stalk","36:40":"The sun is not allowed to reach the moon, nor does the night overtake the day, but each floats in their own orbit","36:41":"Another sign for them is that We carried their offspring in the loaded Ark","36:42":"And that We have created for them similar vessels in which to ride","36:43":"If We wish, We could drown them, with no one to respond to their cry for help, nor would they be saved","36:44":"except through Our mercy, that they could be given a while to enjoy life","36:45":"But when they are told, \"Beware of what lies before you and what lies behind you; perhaps you will be shown mercy","36:46":"they turn away from every sign that comes to them from their Lord","36:47":"And when It is said to them, \"Give to others from what God has provided for you,\" the unbelievers say to those who believe, \"Should we feed one whom, if God had willed, He would have fed? You are clearly misguided","36:48":"They say, \"When will this promise come about, if you are truthful","36:49":"All it takes is one blast that will seize them while they still arguing about it","36:50":"They will not be able [to give] any testimony, nor will they return to their people","36:51":"And then the Horn will be blown, and at once they will rush out of the graves to their Lord","36:52":"They will say, \"How terrible for us! Who has raised us up from our resting-place?\" [They will be told], \"This is what the Merciful-to-all had promised, and the Messengers told the Truth","36:53":"It will be only one blast, and at once they are all brought before Us","36:54":"Today no soul will be wronged at all, and you will be repaid for what you did","36:55":"The people of Paradise will on that Day be joyfully engaged","36:56":"they and their spouses will lie in shades, reclining on couches","36:57":"where they will have fruit and whatever they wish","36:58":"and their Lord, the Mercy giver, will great them with \"Peace","36:59":"[But to the guilty, He will say], \"Those who forced others to reject Our messages should stand apart today","36:60":"Children of Adam, did I not make a covenant with you not to worship Satan, who is clearly your enemy","36:61":"and that you worship [only] Me? This is a straight path","36:62":"[Satan] has already led a great many of you astray; why do you not use your reason","36:63":"This is the Hell that you were promised","36:64":"Enter it today as a result of your having denied the truth","36:65":"Today, We will seal over their mouths, but their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will testify about what they used to do","36:66":"And if We willed it, We could have taken away their sight, and they would have struggled to [find] the path, but how could they have seen it","36:67":"And if We had so willed, We could have crippled them where they stood, so that they could move neither forward nor backward","36:68":"When We grant a person long life, We also cause him to decline in power, so will they not understand","36:69":"We did not teach [the Prophet] poetry, nor it is suitable for him. This is simply a reminder and a self-evident Qur'an","36:70":"to warn those whose hearts are alive, and to pass God's verdict against the unbelievers","36:71":"Can they not see that, by Our own handiwork, We have created livestock for them, that they now control","36:72":"We have tamed [those animals] for them, so that they can ride some of them, and some they can eat","36:73":"and some have other benefits, [such as milk] to drink. Will they not, then, be grateful","36:74":"Yet they have taken [false] gods besides God, hoping that they will help them","36:75":"but [their false gods] cannot help them, even if they were soldiers standing by, ready to support them","36:76":"So do not let what they say grieve you. We know what they conceal and what they reveal","36:77":"Does a human being not consider that We created him from a [mere] fertilized ovum, yet he becomes a fierce adversary","36:78":"Now, he argues about Us while he overlooks how he himself was created. He says, \"Who will give life to bones when they are disintegrated","36:79":"Say, \"He who made them in the first instance will give them life again. He has full knowledge of all creation","36:80":"He, who produces fire for you from green trees, so that you use them to light your fires","36:81":"Is not He who created the heavens and the earth able to create the same again? Yes, indeed, for He is the All-Knowing, the Creator","36:82":"When He wills something to be, His simply says, \"Be\"- and it is","36:83":"Exalted in His glory is He who has the dominion of all things in His hand, and to Him you will return","37:1":"By those lined up in ranks","37:2":"and those who warn, crying warnings","37:3":"and those who recite God's word","37:4":"your God is One","37:5":"Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything between them, Lord of every sunrise","37:6":"We have adorned the nearest heaven with planets","37:7":"and protected them against every rebellious devil","37:8":"[so that the devils] may not listen to the highest assembly [of angels] but be repelled from every side","37:9":"driven away. For them there is a continuous punishment","37:10":"except for him who snatches a glimpse [of such knowledge], He will be pursued by a piercing flame","37:11":"Then ask those who persist on denying the truth if they were more difficult to create than those other beings We have created, for We created them from sticky clay","37:12":"No wonder you are surprised, to see them ridicule [the message]","37:13":"and when they are reminded [of the Truth], they don't want to remember","37:14":"and when they see a sign, they ridicule it","37:15":"saying, \"This is mere magic","37:16":"When We have died and become dust and bones, are we to be resurrected","37:17":"and our forefathers too","37:18":"Say, \"Yes, and [on that Day of Judgment] you will be humiliated","37:19":"[On that Day,] there will be only a single shout, and at once they will begin to see","37:20":"They will say, \"How terrible for us! This is the Day of Judgment","37:21":"and [They will be told], \"This is the Day of separation [between the good and the bad], which you used to deny","37:22":"[The angels will be ordered], \"Gather those who were unjust, all those like them, and the idols they used to worship","37:23":"instead of God, and show them to the path of Hell","37:24":"And stop them, for they are to be questioned","37:25":"Why do you not help each other now","37:26":"No, today they come in absolute submission","37:27":"and they will turn on one another, questioning each other","37:28":"[Some] will say, \"You used to approach us from a position of power","37:29":"The others will say, \"No, you [yourselves] were not believers","37:30":"and we had no authority over you, but you were exceedingly arrogant people","37:31":"Our Lord's Word has been carried out against us, and we will all taste punishment","37:32":"We misled you, and we were ourselves misled","37:33":"On that Day, they will share in the punishment","37:34":"for that is how We deal with those who forced others to reject Our messages","37:35":"Whenever they were told, \"There is no god but God,\" they became arrogant","37:36":"and would say, \"Are we to give up our gods for a mad poet","37:37":"Rather, the Prophet has come with the Truth and confirmed the [previous] messengers","37:38":"You [who deny the truth] will taste the painful punishment","37:39":"and you will be repaid only for what you used to do","37:40":"Not so for God's devoted worshipers","37:41":"they will have recognizable

them","37:46":"white and delicious to the drinkers","37:47":"which will neither sicken nor intoxicate them","37:48":"With them are mates of modest gaze with beautiful eyes","37:49":"just like closely guarded pearls","37:50":"They will turn to one another, inquiring","37:51":"One of them says\" I used to have a friend [on earth]","37:52":"who used to say to me, are you of those who believe","37:53":"that, when we have died and become dust and bones, we will be brought for judgment","37:54":"And he will add, \"Shall we look for him","37:55":"And he looks and sees [his former companion] in the midst of Hell","37:56":"He says to him, \"By God, you almost ruined me","37:57":"Were It not for the grace of my Lord, I would have been with those taken [to Hell]","37:58":"Then, [he says to those in paradise], \"Will we really not die","37:59":"except for our first death, and will we really not be punished","37:60":"Truly, this is the ultimate success","37:61":"This is what everyone should strive to attain","37:62":"Is Paradise a better place to be, or the tree of Bitterness","37:63":"We have made [this tree] a punishment for the unjust","37:64":"It is a tree that grows in the heart of Hell","37:65":"Its fruit like devils' heads","37:66":"and [the people in Hell] will eat from it and fill their bellies with it","37:67":"On top of that, they will have a boiling brew to drink","37:68":"Then they will return to Hell","37:69":"for they found their fathers misguided","37:70":"so they rushed [to follow] in their footsteps","37:71":"Most of the earlier peoples went astray before them","37:72":"though We had already sent them someone to give warning","37:73":"Look, then, at the final fate of those who were warned","37:74":"except for the devout worshipers of God","37:75":"Noah called Us, and how excellent was Our response","37:76":"We saved him and his family from the great distress","37:77":"We made his descendants the survivors","37:78":"and left for him [favorable mention] among later generations","37:79":"Peace upon Noah, among all people","37:80":"This is how we reward those who do good","37:81":"for he was among Our believing worshipers","37:82":"We drowned the rest","37:83":"Abraham was like him","37:84":"He came to his Lord with a faultless heart","37:85":"and said to his father and his people, \"What are you worshiping","37:86":"Are you fooling yourselves by choosing false gods other than God","37:87":"What do you think about the Lord of the worlds","37:88":"Then he took a look at the stars","37:89":"and said, \"I am sick [of you worshipping these]","37:90":"so they turned away from him and left","37:91":"Then he turned to their gods and said, \"Will you not eat","37:92":"What is wrong with you that you do not speak","37:93":"And he turned on them, striking them with his right hand","37:94":"His people came rushing back to him","37:95":"He said, \"How can you worship that which you [yourselves] carve","37:96":"while God created you and everything you do","37:97":"They said, \"Construct a furnace and throw him into the burning fire","37:98":"They plotted against him, but We humiliated them","37:99":"[Abraham] said, \"I will go away to my Lord, He will guide me","37:100":"My Lord, grant me a righteous son","37:101":"So We gave him the good news of a gentle boy","37:102":"And when

Yet what they achieved was of no use to them","40:83":"When their messengers came to them with self-evident signs, they showed satisfaction with the knowledge they had, and so they were engulfed by the very punishment they had mocked","40:84":"Then, when they saw Our might, they said,\" We believe in God alone, and we reject what we used to associate with Him","40:85":"But believing after seeing Our might did not help them at all. This has been God's way of dealing with His worshipers, and those who denied the truth were lost, then and there","41:1":"Ha Meem","41:2":"revelations have come down to you from the Merciful-to-All, the Mercy Giver","41:3":"a Book whose verses have been made clear, an Arabic Qur'an for people who know","41:4":"giving good news and warning. Yet, most of them turn away, so they do not hear","41:5":"and they say, \"There is a barrier between our hearts and what you call us to, and there is heaviness in our ears. There is a curtain between us and you. So do whatever you want, and so shall we","41:6":"Say, \"I am only a human like you. It has been revealed to me that your god is but One God. So be upright towards Him, and seek His forgiveness.\" How terrible it is for the idolaters","41:7":"those who do not give the purifying alms and refuse to believe in the Hereafter","41:8":"Those who believe and do good deeds will have an endless reward","41:9":"Say, \"Do you deny the One who created the earth in two days, and attribute equals to Him? That is the Lord of the worlds","41:10":"He placed firm mountains over it, and He blessed it and apportioned its provisions to all who would seek them, [all] in four days","41:11":"Then He turned to the Heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, \"Come willingly or unwillingly.\" They said, \"We come willingly","41:12":"He decreed that they are seven heavens in two days, and He revealed to each its mandate. And We decorated the lower heaven with lanterns and protection. Such is the design of the Almighty, the All-Knowing","41:13":"If they turn away, say, \"I have warned you of a thunderbolt like the one which struck Aad and Thamud","41:14":"when their messengers came to them from all around them, saying \"Do not worship anyone but God.\" They said, \"Had our Lord willed, He would have sent down angels; therefore, we reject the message with which you were sent","41:15":"As for Aad, they were arrogant in the land, opposed justice, and said, \"Who could have a power greater than ours?\" Did they not see that God who created them is more powerful than they? But they continued to reject Our signs","41:16":"so We sent a screaming wind upon them for a few miserable days to make them taste the punishment of disgrace in this worldly life; but the punishment of the Hereafter will be more humiliating, and they will not be helped","41:17":"As for Thamud, We guided them, but they preferred blindness over guidance, so the thunderbolt of humiliating punishment seized them, just as they deserved","41:18":"And We saved those who believed and were mindful of God","41:19":"On the Day when God's enemies will be herded to the Fire, driven in rows","41:20":"until, when they have reached it, their hearing, their sight and their skins will testify against them concerning what they were doing","41:21":"They will ask their skins, \"Why did you testified against us?\" They will say, \"God, who gave speech to everything, has given us speech; it is He Who created you the first time, and to Him you will return","41:22":"You did not even try to conceal yourselves from your hearing or your sights or your skins to prevent them from testifying against you, but you assumed that God did not know much of what you were doing","41:23":"It is this thought which you assumed about your Lord that led you to ruin, so that you became doomed","41:24":"So [even] if they are patient, the Fire will be their home, and if they plead for a favor, none will be given them","41:25":"[for] We had assigned them companions, who made what is before them and what was behind them seem alluring. But the sentence has already been passed against them, together with generations of jinn and men before them: they were doomed","41:26":"The unbelievers say, \"Do not listen to this Qur'an but talk over it, so that you may prevail","41:27":"But We will surely cause the unbelievers to taste a severe punishment, and We will reward them according to the worst of their deeds","41:28":"Such is the repayment of God's enemies, the Fire, where they will have their permanent home as payment for having disregarded Our revelations","41:29":"The unbelievers will say, \"Our Lord, show us those jinn and men who misled us; we will trample them under our feet so that they become the lowest of the low","41:30":"Those who say, \"Our Lord is God,\" and then stay on the right course, on them the angels will descend on them and say, \"Do not fear or grieve, but [rather] rejoice in the news of Paradise, which you have been promised","41:31":"we are your allies in this life and in the Hereafter, where you will have whatever your souls desire, and you will have whatever you wish","41:32":"as a welcoming gift from the Most Forgiving, the Mercy Giver","41:33":"Who speaks better than someone who calls people to God, does good deeds, and says, \"I am among those who submit to God","41:34":"Good and evil are never equal. Repel evil with good, and your enemy will become like an intimate friend","41:35":"But, none will attain it except those who are steadfast in patience, and none will attain it except the very fortunate","41:36":"And when a temptation from Satan provokes you, seek refuge in God; He is the All-Hearing and the All-knowing","41:37":"Among His signs are the night, the day, the sun and the moon. Do not bow down in worship to the sun, nor to the moon, but bow down to God, Who created them, if it is Him that you worship","41:38":"But if they respond arrogantly, [it matters not] for those who are near your Lord praise His limitless glory by night and by day, and never grow tired","41:39":"Another of His signs is that you see the earth humbly desolate, but when We send down rain on it, it quivers and swells. He who revived it will revive the dead. He has power over all things","41:40":"Those who distort Our verses are not hidden from Us. Does he who is thrown into the Fire fare better than he who will arrive securely on the Day of Resurrection? Do what you want; He Sees everything you do","41:41":"Those who reject this Reminder after it has come to them [are losers], as it is a mighty Book","41:42":"that falsehood cannot approach neither openly or secretly, [one] sent down from the All-Wise and Praiseworthy","41:43":"Nothing has been said to you [Prophet] that was not said to the messengers before you. Your Lord is a Lord of Forgiveness, but also of painful punishment","41:44":"Had We made it a Qur'an in a foreign language, they would have said, \"If only its verses were made clear.\" What? A [book in a] foreign language to an Arab?\" Say, \"It is guidance and healing for those who believe, but for those who do not believe, it is heaviness in their ears, and it is blindness for them, as if they were being called from a distant place","41:45":"We gave Moses the Book, but there was disagreement about it, and had it not for a prior decree from your Lord, their differences would already have been settled. But they are still suspicious and in doubt about it","41:46":"Whoever does good works, does so for his own soul; and whoever does evil, does so to its detriment. Your Lord is never unjust to His worshipers","41:47":"Knowledge of the Hour belongs solely to him; no fruit emerges from its husk nor does a female conceive or give birth without His knowledge. On the Day when He calls out to them, \"Where are My associates?\" They will then say, \"We admit to You, none of us witnessed any","41:48":"What they used to pray to before will forsake them, and they will realize that they have no escape","41:49":"A human being never tires of praying for good things; but when hard times afflict him, he despairs and loses hope","41:50":"And if We let him taste mercy from Us, after hard times have afflicted him, he will say, \"This is my due, and I do not think the Hour [of Judgment] is going to come; but even if I were to be returned to my Lord, I will [surely] have the very best reward from Him.\" But We will inform the unbelievers of what they did, and We will make them taste an awful punishment","41:51":"And whenever We're gracious to a human being, he turns away and distances himself, but when hard times touch him, he starts endless prayers","41:52":"Say, \"What if this revelation is truly from God, and you are rejecting it? Who is more misguided than he who is cutoff and alienated [from God]","41:53":"We will show them Our signs on the horizons and in themselves, until it is clear to them that this is the Truth. Is it not sufficient that your Lord is a Witness over all things","41:54":"Surely, they are in doubt about meeting their Lord. Surely, He encompasses everything","42:1":"Ha Meem","42:2":"A'yn Seen Qaf","42:3":"thus God, the Almighty, the Wise reveals to you, as He did to those before you","42:4":"To Him belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. He is the Most High, the Most Great","42:5":"The heavens above them almost burst apart [from awe of Him], while the angels praise their Lord's limitless glory and ask forgiveness for those on earth. God is indeed the Ever Forgiving, the Mercy giver","42:6":"As for those who take others than Him as protectors, God is in charge of them and you are not their keeper","42:7":"Thus We have revealed to you an Arabic Qur'an that you may warn this main city and all others around it and to give warning of the Day of Gathering, about which there is no doubt, when some will be in the Garden and some in the Blazing Fire","42:8":"Had God willed, He could have made them one community, but He admits into His mercy him that wills. As for the unjust, they will have no protector and no helper","42:9":"Or do they think that they have protectors other than Him? God is the Protector, for He gives life to the dead, and He is able to do all things","42:10":"Whatever matters you differ about, is for God to judge. Such is God, my Lord, in whom I trust, and unto Him I repent","42:11":"the Creator of the heavens and earth who separated them and gave each a purpose. He has made mates for you from among yourselves, and gave mates to the animals, so that you may multiply. There is nothing like Him. He is the All-Hearing, the All- Seeing","42:12":"To Him belongs control of the heavens and the earth. He provides abundantly or scarcely to whoever He wills. He is, the All-knowing","42:13":"He has ordained for you the same faith He commanded Noah, and what We have revealed to you, and what We commanded Abraham and Moses and Jesus: \"You shall uphold the faith and do not break up into factions.\" Although what you are calling the idolaters to do is too hard for them. [However] God draws to Himself everyone who is willing, and guides unto Himself everyone who turns to Him","42:14":"Yet they [the followers] split into factions, out of rivalry between them only after they came to know the truth. Judgment between them would have been pronounced, were it not for a decision from your Lord to postpone it until a set time. Yet those who have inherited the Book after them are in grave doubt about it","42:15":"Therefore, go on inviting them and stay the course as you have been commanded. Do not follow their whims and desires but say, \"I have believed in what God has sent down of the Book, and I have been commanded to judge equitably between you. God is our Lord and your Lord. We have our deeds, and you have your deeds. Let there be no quarrel between us and you. God will bring us all together, and to Him is the ultimate return","42:16":"And those who argue about God after having answered His call, their argument has no basis whatsoever with their Lord. Anger enfolds them, and a severe punishment awaits them","42:17":"It is God who has sent down the Book with the Truth and the Balance. For all you know, the Hour might be near","42:18":"Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it; but those who believe are concerned about it, as they know it is the Truth. Unquestionably, those who question the Hour are in extreme error","42:19":"God is very gentle with His worshipers; He provides for whomever He wills. He is the All- Powerful, the Almighty","42:20":"If anyone desires the harvest of the Hereafter, We will increase for him his harvest. And if he desires the harvest of this world, We will give him a share of it, but He will have no share of the Hereafter","42:21":"Or do they have partners who have ordained for them some faith that is not authorized by God? Were it not for [God's] decisive word, Judgment would have been made between them. The unjust will have a painful punishment","42:22":"You will see the unjust worried about what they have committed, as they will have to answer for it. While those who have believed and done good deeds are in flowering meadows of the Gardens, having whatever they wish from their Lord: that is the supreme blessing","42:23":"This is the good news God gives to His worshipers who believe and do good deeds.Say, \"I do not ask you any wage for it, except affection due to kin.\" Whoever does a good deed, We will increase it for him. God is Ever Forgiving and Most Appreciative","42:24":"Or do they say, \"He falsely claimed lies about God?\" If God so willed, He could have sealed your heart, exterminated falsehood and confirmed the Truth with His Words. He has full Knowledge of what is in the hearts","42:25":"It is He who accepts repentance from his worshipers and forgives bad deeds, He knows what you do","42:26":"He answers those who have believed and done good deeds and increases for them out of His grace. But the unbelievers will have a severe punishment","42:27":"Were God to expand provision to His worshipers, they would have committed tyranny on earth. But He sends down whatever He wills in due measures. He is, well Acquainted and Fully Aware of His worshipers","42:28":"It is He who sends down the rain after they have lost hope and unfolds His mercy. He is the Protector, the Praiseworthy","42:29":"Among His signs is the creation of the heavens and earth and the creatures He has spread throughout them: He is Able to gather them together if He so wishes","42:30":"Whatever disaster strikes you, It is for what your hands have done; Yet He forgives much","42:31":"On earth you will not be beyond God's reach. You do not have any protector or helper besides God","42:32":"Among His Signs are ships floating like mountains through the sea","42:33":"If He wills, He could have settled down the winds, leaving them motionless on its surface. Surely in that are signs for every patient and grateful person","42:34":"Or He could destroy them for what they have earned; yet He pardons much","42:35":"Those who argue about Our signs know that there is no escape for them","42:36":"Whatever you have been given is only the provision of this life. But that which is with God is better and more enduring for those who believe and trust in their Lord","42:37":"those who avoid major sins and gross indecencies, and even if they become angry, they will forgive","42:38":"and those who respond to their Lord, pray regularly, conduct their affairs by mutual consultation, and give of what We have provided for them","42:39":"and those who, when tyranny strikes them, they defend themselves","42:40":"The retribution for a bad deed is one like it, but whoever forgives and makes peace will have his reward with God. He certainly does not like those who do wrong","42:41":"Yet whoever defends himself after having been wronged, there is no blame on them","42:42":"Blame lies on those who wrong others and transgress in the land without any justification. Those will have a painful punishment","42:43":"As for him who endures patiently and forgives, that is a sign of real resolve","42:44":"Whoever God lets go astray will have no protector apart from Him. And you will see the transgressors, when they see the punishment, saying, \"Is there a way of going back","42:45":"As they are exposed to the Fire, you will see them humbled from humiliation, glancing around covertly. While those who believed will say, \"The losers are those who lost themselves and their kin on the Day of Resurrection.\" Verily, the unjust are in an enduring punishment","42:46":"they have no allies to support them apart from God. Anyone God lets go astray will find no way out","42:47":"Respond to your Lord before a Day comes from God's judgment that cannot be turned back. You will have no refuge on that Day and no means of denial","42:48":"But if they turn away, We did not send you as their guardian. Your only duty is to deliver the message. When We let man taste Our mercy, he rejoices in it; but if harm afflicts him for what his hands have done, then man turns to denial","42:49":"The kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to God. He creates what he wills. He gives daughters to whomever He wills, and He gives sons to whom He wills","42:50":"Or, and He makes whom He wills sterile. He is All-knowing and Able to do all things","42:51":"God will not speak to any human being except by revelation or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger who then reveals, by His permission, whatever He wills. He is Most High and All Wise","42:52":"Accordingly We have revealed to you a Spirit of Our command. You did not know what is the Book or what faith is, but We have made it an enlightenment, guiding with it whom We wish of Our worshipers. You indeed guide to a straight path","42:53":"the path of God, to whom belongs everything that is in the heavens and earth. Truly, all will eventually return to God","43:1":"Ha Meem","43:2":"by the Book that make things clear","43:3":"We have caused it to be an Arabic Qur'an that you may understand","43:4":"It is in the Source of the Book with Us, exalted and full of Wisdom","43:5":"Should we then withdraw the Reminder from you, because you are excessive in your rejection","43:6":"How many prophets We sent among the earlier people","43:7":"and they used to ridicule every one of them","43:8":"We destroyed people mightier than these, and their example has gone down in history","43:9":"And if you ask them, \"Who created the heavens and the earth?\" they would say, \"They were created by the Almighty, the All-knowing","43:10":"It is He who made the earth a cradle for you and made pathways in it for you, that you might be guided","43:11":"It is He who sends down rain from the sky in measured portions; We resurrect with it a dead town back to life. Similarly you will be brought forth","43:12":"It is He who created the pairs, all of them, and has made it possible for you to ride ships and animals","43:13":"That you may settle on their backs and remember your Lord's blessings when you have settled and say. \"Exalted in His glory is He who subjected this to us. We on our own would not have been able to have it","43:14":"We will surely return to our Lord","43:15":"Yet they attribute to Him only some of what He has created. Man is clearly ungrateful","43:16":"Or has He taken daughters for himself and favored you with sons","43:17":"Yet when any of them is given the good news of what he himself attributes to the Merciful, his face darkens, and he suppresses grief","43:18":"what [am I to have a daughter], someone to be brought up in ornaments but cannot help in a fight","43:19":"Yet, they designated the angels, who are created to worship the Merciful, as females. Have they witnessed their creation? Their claim will be recorded, and they will be questioned about it","43:20":"They say, \"If the Merciful willed it, we would not have worshipped them.\" But they do not know that. They are merely guessing","43:21":"Or have We given them a Book prior to this one, to which they are adhering","43:22":"No they say, but \"We found our fathers following this path, and we are guided by their footsteps","43:23":"Similarly, every time We sent someone before you to a town to warn them, those corrupted by abundance would say, \"We found our fathers following this path, and we are following in their footsteps","43:24":"Say, even if I bring you better guidance than what you found your fathers following?\" They reply, \"We reject, what You have been sent with","43:25":"So we punish them; reflect then on the end of those who rejected the truth","43:26":"And when Abraham said to his father and his people, \"I have nothing to do with what you worship","43:27":"I worship only the One who created me and gave me purpose, He will guide me","43:28":"He made this as an enduring word remaining among Abraham's descendants that they might return [to it]","43:29":"Now, I let these people of yours [Prophet] and their forefathers have some enjoyment, until the Truth and a messenger who made things clear came to them","43:30":"But when the Truth came to them, they said, \"This is magic and we refuse to believe it","43:31":"They also said, \"If only this Qur'an was sent down to a great man from the two cities","43:32":"Is it they who distribute your Lord's blessing? It is We who have allocated their livelihood among them in this life. We have raised some of them in rank, so that some would hire others for service. But your Lord's mercy is better than whatever they accumulate","43:33":"Were it not that people might become a single community, We would have provided those who deny the Merciful-to-all, silver roofs for their houses and silver stairways to ascend","43:34":"and silver doors to their houses and furnishings on which to recline","43:35":"and gold ornaments. But all that is merely the possessions of this life, while the Hereafter with your Lord is for those who are mindful of Him","43:36":"Whoever overlooks the remembrance of the Merciful, We assign him a devil, for a companion","43:37":"They hinder them from the path, though they think they are guided","43:38":"Then, when such a person comes to Us, he says [to his companion] \"I wish you had been as far away from me as east is from west. What an evil companion","43:39":"Since you were both unjust, It will not benefit you today to know, that you are partners in the punishment","43:40":"Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the blind and whoever is clearly misguided","43:41":"Whether We take you away, We will afflict retribution on them","43:42":"Or, We show you what We have promised them; for We have perfect ability to control them","43:43":"So adhere to what is revealed to you. You are on a straight path","43:44":"It is a remembrance for you and your people, and you are all going to be questioned","43:45":"Ask those of Our messengers We sent before you; did We ever appoint any deities besides the Merciful to be worshipped","43:46":"We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his inner circle. He said, \"I am the Messenger of the Lord of the worlds","43:47":"But when he came to them with Our signs, they laughed at them","43:48":"Each sign We showed them was more marvelous than the previous one. So We afflicted them with punishment, so that they might return","43:49":"They said \"Magician, pray to your Lord for us, as He has a covenant with you, and We will be guided","43:50":"But when We lifted the punishment from them, they broke their word","43:51":"Then Pharaoh called out among his people; he said, \"My people, does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me, and these rivers that flow under my feet? Do not you see","43:52":"Am I not better than this insignificant person who can barely make himself understood","43:53":"Why then are not golden bracelets placed on him, or the angels are accompanying him","43:54":"He [Pharaoh] easily swayed his people, and they obeyed him. [To Us] they were disobedient people","43:55":"but when they continued to challenge Us, We inflicted Our punishment on them, and drowned them all","43:56":"We made them a precedent and an example for the others","43:57":"And when the son of Mary was given as an example, immediately your people [Prophet] loudly objected","43:58":"and they said, \"who is better, our gods or him?\" They cite him only for arguments sake. In fact, they are a confrontational people","43:59":"[Jesus] was a servant whom We blessed, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel","43:60":"Had We so willed, We could have made you into angels succeeding one another on earth","43:61":"He [Jesus] is a [sign for] knowledge of the Hour, so have no doubt about it, and follow Me. This is a straight path","43:62":"Never let Satan divert you. He is a clear enemy to you all","43:63":"When Jesus came with clear evidence, he said, \"I have brought you Wisdom and to clarify for you some of what you differ about. Be always mindful of God and obey me","43:64":"God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path","43:65":"But the factions differed among themselves. How terrible is the punishment of a painful Day to the unjust","43:66":"What are they waiting for except for the Hour to come suddenly upon them when they are not expecting it","43:67":"On that Day, close friends will be enemies to each other, except for those who are mindful of God","43:68":"My worshipers, you have nothing to fear on that Day, nor will you grieve","43:69":"those who believed in Our revelations and were submissive","43:70":"Enter the Garden, you and your spouses, filled with Joy","43:71":"Passed among them will be plates and cups of gold. They will have whatever their soul desire and whatever delights their eyes. There you will remain forever","43:72":"That is the Garden which you are made to inherit because of what you have done","43:73":"There will be much fruit for you to eat","43:74":"Those who force others to reject Our messages will be in the punishment of Hell forever","43:75":"It will not be allowed to be eased for them. In it, they will be crushed by despair","43:76":"We did not wrong them, but it was they who were the unjust","43:77":"They will call, \"Malik, let your Lord finish us off!\" He will say, \"You are staying","43:78":"We have given you the Truth, but most of you, hate the Truth","43:79":"Or have they thought up some scheme? We too have been scheming","43:80":"Or do they think that We cannot hear their secrets and their private talk? Yes, We can, and Our messengers are with them writing it down","43:81":"Say, \"If the Merciful-to-all had a son, then I would be the first to worship him","43:82":"Exalted is the Lord of the heavens and the earth in His glory, Lord of the Throne, totally above what they ascribe to Him","43:83":"So, let them indulge in idle talk and play until they face that Day of theirs which they have been promised","43:84":"It is He who is God in heaven, and God on earth. He is the All-Wise, the All-Knowing","43:85":"And blessed is He Who has sovereignty over the heavens and the earth and everything between them. He alone has knowledge of the Hour. You will all be returned to Him","43:86":"Those deities they invoke besides Him have no power of intercession; only those who testify to the Truth and have full knowledge","43:87":"And if you asked them who created them, they would say, \"God.\" Why do they mislead","43:88":"As for his saying, \"My Lord, these are people who do not believe","43:89":"So forgive them and talk peace. Eventually they will come to know","44:1":"Ha Meem","44:2":"by the Book that makes things clear","44:3":"We have revealed it on a Blessed Night; We have been warning","44:4":"On that night every matter of wisdom is made distinct","44:5":"A decree from Us. We have been sending messages","44:6":"as mercy from your Lord. He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing","44:7":"The Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and everything between them, if you only can grasp this with certainty","44:8":"There is no god but Him; He gives life and causes death. [He is] your Sustainer and the Sustainer of your forefathers from the beginning","44:9":"Yet they who lack certainty toy with their doubts","44:10":"So watch out for the Day when the sky will bring visible smoke","44:11":"enveloping all people; \"This is a painful punishment","44:12":"[Then they will say], \"Our Lord, lift the punishment from us, we now believe","44:13":"But how can this sudden remembrance benefit them? When a messenger explaining things clearly has already come to them","44:14":"and they turned away from him saying, \"He is tutored but possessed","44:15":"We will postpone the punishment for a while. But you will eventually return to us","44:16":"The Day when We will strike with the greatest assault, We will take retribution","44:17":"We had already tested Pharaoh's people before them, when a noble messenger came to them","44:18":"[saying], \"Hand over to me the servants of God. I am a trustworthy Messenger to you","44:19":"Never be arrogant with God. I come to you with clear authority","44:20":"I have sought refuge with my Lord and your Lord, against your condemnation","44:21":"If you don't believe me, then [at least] leave me alone","44:22":"He then called out to his Lord that these were evil people","44:23":"[God said], \"Then set out with My servants by night. You will be pursued","44:24":"Cross the sea quickly and leave it as is. They are an army to be drowned","44:25":"How many gardens and fountains did they leave behind","44:26":"And crops and noble residences","44:27":"and that life of ease that they used to enjoy","44:28":"So it was; Yet We passed it on to other people to inherit","44:29":"Neither heaven nor earth wept for them, nor were they given a reprieve","44:30":"And We saved the Children of Israel from the humiliating persecution","44:31":"from Pharaoh.

The promise of God is true.\" But he says, \"These are only ancient tales","46:18":"Those are the ones upon whom the verdict is justified, among nations that went before them of jinn and humans. They are truly doomed","46:19":"Everyone will be ranked according to what they have done. He will pay them in full for their deeds, and they will not be wronged","46:20":"On the Day when the unbelievers are exposed to the Fire: \"You have squandered the good things you had in your worldly life, and you took your portion of pleasure there.

This is how We repay those who force others to reject Our messages","46:26":"We had empowered them far better than We empowered you, and We gave them hearing, vision and hearts. But their hearing, vision and hearts were of no use to them as they were rejecting the signs of God; and so they became surrounded by the very punishment they used to ridicule","46:27":"We have destroyed other towns around you, after We have diversified Our signs to them that perhaps they will return to the right path","46:28":"Why then did those idols, whom they worshiped to bring them nearer to God, not help them? In fact, they abandoned them. It was all falsehood of their own making","46:29":"We sent a group of jinn to you [Prophet) to listen to the Qur'an.

Say, \"If God intended harm for you or intended benefit, who can intervene for you? God is fully aware of what you do","48:12":"But you thought that the Messenger and the believers will never return to their families, ever, and this seemed fine to your hearts. You harbored evil thoughts, and were corrupt people","48:13":"For those who do not believe in God and His Messenger, We have prepared a blazing Fire","48:14":"To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills.

Some of them were guided, but many were wicked","57:27":"Then We sent Our Messengers to follow in their footsteps and followed up with Jesus, the son of Mary, and gave him the Gospel. We placed compassion and mercy in the hearts of those who followed him. As for monasticism, which they invented to seek God's pleasure, We did not ordain for them, and they did not observe properly. So We gave those who believed among them their reward, but many of them are wicked","57:28":"Believers, be ever mindful of God and believe in His Messenger; He will give you a double share of His mercy, provide you a light to guide you and forgive you; God is Ever Forgiving and Merciful-to-all","57:29":"That the people of the Book may know that they have no power whatsoever over God's blessings, and that all blessings are in God's Hand; He gives it to whomever He wills.

But if you do not find the means to do so, then God is Ever-Forgiving and Merciful-to-all","58:13":"Do you regret not offering charity before your conversation with the Prophet? If you did not give, and God pardoned you, then perform prayers, and give charitable gifts, and obey God and His Messenger.

He is the Almighty, the Most Wise","59:2":"It is He who evicted those who broke faith among the people of the Book from their homes at the first mobilization. You did not think they would leave, and they thought their fortresses would protect them from God. But God came at them from where they least expected it, and He put panic into their hearts. They wrecked their homes with their own hands, and by the hands of the believers. Therefore, take a lesson, all of you with insight","59:3":"Had God not decreed evacuation for them, He would have punished them in this world, and in the Hereafter they will have the punishment of the Fire","59:4":"That is because they opposed God and His Messenger. God is severe in punishment toward anyone opposing God","59:5":"Whatever you have cut down of their palm trees or left standing on its roots, it is by permission of God. So that He might disgrace the defiantly disobedient","59:6":"Whatever God has given to His Messenger from them; you did not have to spur your horses or camels for them, but God gives authority to His Messengers over whomever He will. God is able to do all things","59:7":"Whatever gains God has restored to His Messenger from the villages' inhabitants belongs to God, the Messenger, the relatives, the orphans, the needy, and to the wayfarer; so that it may not circulate mainly between the wealthy among you.

God is severe in punishment","59:8":"It is also for the poor emigrants who were driven out of their homes and their possessions, who seek God's blessings and His approval, and support God and His Messenger. Those are the truly sincere","59:9":"And (also for] those who before them, were already established in their homes [in Medina], and have accepted faith. They love those who migrated to them, and find no hesitation in their hearts in helping them. They give them preference over themselves, even if they themselves are needy.

Our Lord, You are Most Compassionate, Merciful-to-all","59:11":"Have you noticed those who act hypocritically? They say to their brothers, the faithless among the people of the Book, \"If you are driven out, we will surely leave with you, and we will not obey anyone who wants to harm you; and should anyone fight you, we will certainly support you.\" But God bears witness that they are truly liars","59:12":"If they are driven out, they will not leave with them, and if they are fought, they will not support them. Even if they should support them, they will surely turn their backs and flee; then they will not be helped","59:13":"Indeed, you [believers] strike more terror in their hearts than their fear of God. That is because they are a people who do not understand","59:14":"Even united they will not fight you except within fortified strongholds, or from behind walls. There is much hostility between them. You think they are united, but their hearts are diverse. That is because they are a people without reason","59:15":"Like those who went shortly before them. They experience the evil consequences of their decisions. A painful punishment awaits them","59:16":"They are like Satan who says to a human being, \"Do not believe.\" But when he denies the truth, he says, \"I disown you; I fear God, the Lord of the worlds","59:17":"The ultimate end of both is the Fire, where they will dwell forever. That is the reward of the unjust","59:18":"Believers, be mindful of God.

Whatever is in the heavens and earth glorifies Him. He is the Almighty, the Wise","60:1":"Believers do not take My enemies and yours as allies, offering them affection, when they have rejected the Truth that has come to you. They have driven you and the Messenger out, because you believe in God, your Lord. If you have decided to struggle in My way, seeking My approval, how can you secretly love them? I know what you concealed and what you reveal. Whoever among you does that is straying from the right path","60:2":"If they ever gain dominance over you, they will treat you as enemies, and they will stretch out their hands and tongues to hurt you. They would dearly wish that you renounce your faith","60:3":"Never will your blood lines or your children be of any use to you. God will separate you on the Day of Resurrection. God is All-Seeing of what you do","60:4":"There has already been a good example for you in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, \"we disown you and what you worship besides God.

God is Ever Forgiving and Merciful-to-all","60:8":"God does not forbid you from dealing kindly and equitably with those who did not fight you because of your faith and did not drive you out of your homes. God loves those who are equitable","60:9":"But God forbids you from befriending those who fought against you over your faith and drove you from your homes and helped others to drive you out. Any who takes them for friends are the wrongdoers","60:10":"Believers, when believing women come to you as emigrants, test them. God knows best about their faith. And if you find them to be faithful, then do not return them to the unbelievers. They are not lawful wives for them, nor are they their lawful husbands. But give the unbelievers what they have spent. You are not to blame if you marry them later provided you give them their dues. And do not hold to marriage bonds with unbelieving women, but ask for what you have spent and let them ask for what they have spent. This is God's judgment; He judges between you. God is All-knowing and All-Wise","60:11":"If any of your wives rejoin the unbelievers, and you decide to penalize them, then give those whose wives have gone the equivalent of what they had spent [out of what you owe the unbelievers].

Calculate the period's term carefully and be mindful of God, your Lord. Do not drive them out of their homes, nor should they leave during that period, unless they have committed a proven adultery. These are the limits of God and whoever oversteps God's limits wrongs his own soul. You never know what new situation God may bring about","65:2":"When they have fulfilled their term, either retain them honorably, or part with them honorably.
