We were merely mocking and making fun","2:15":"Allah makes fun of them! He allows them an extension, and lets them wander about blindly in their arrogant excesses","2:16":"Such ones have traded away the guidance for fallacy and falsehood.

(Now), turn to your Maker in repentance and kill (the guilty ones among) yourself. That, in the eyes of your Maker, is better for you.\" He, then accepted your repentance. Indeed, He it is Who accepts repentance, and He is the most Merciful","2:55":"And (remember) when you said, \"Oh Musa! We will not believe you, until we can perceive Allah in plain view right before our eyes.\" So, a bolt of lightning dealt you a deathblow while you looked on","2:56":"Then, after your death, We revived you. Perhaps you would be grateful","2:57":"We arranged for you the shade of clouds (in the desert), and (as food) We sent down the ´manna´ and the ´salva´ for you. \"Eat the wholesome food We grant you.\" It was not Us they harmed, but they used to harm themselves","2:58":"And (remember) when We said, \"Enter this town and partake of its bounties with relish; anything you wish. But, go past the gate prostrate (before Allah) and keep uttering ´repentance´. We will forgive your sins, and We will increase the reward of the righteous","2:59":"But the evildoers changed the word that was prescribed to them, to one that was quite different. Therefore, from the sky We sent down a blight upon the evil doers, because they used to disobey repeatedly","2:60":"And (remember) when Musa asked for water? We said, \"Strike that rock with your staff!\" Twelve springs gushed forth from the rock and each tribe knew its water supply (exactly). \"Eat and drink the provisions Allah has granted, and do not act wickedly in the world like mischief makers","2:61":"And (remember) when you said, \"Oh Musa! We are weary of just one kind of food (all the time). So call your Lord for us and ask Him to provide us with what the earth produces _ the herbs, the cucumbers, the corn, the garlic and the onions. (Musa) said, \"Do you want to substitute the superior (and the sublime) with that which is petty _ (the mean and the mundane)? Go and settle in any town, and there you will find all that you ask for.\" Disgrace and wretchedness were decreed for them. They drew the wrath of Allah upon themselves, because they repeatedly rejected the revelations (and signs) of Allah, and (because) they killed the prophets without a reason! Because they disobeyed, and used to stray beyond the bounds","2:62":"In fact, all those _ be they the believers, the Jews, the Christians or the Sabians _ who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and do the righteous deeds shall have their reward with their Lord. They shall have no fear, nor shall they ever grieve","2:63":"And (remember) when We got a firm pledge from you as We caused the mountain, ´Toor´, to tower high above you. (We said), \"Hold on fast, with all your strength, to what We grant you; and (always) remember the guidance it contains. Perhaps you would attain piety","2:64":"But, even then you (ignored and) turned away. Had it not been for the favors of Allah upon you, and His grace, you would have been the losers (long ago)","2:65":"Of course, you know very well (the fate of) those of you who exceeded the bounds (and broke the laws) of Sabbath. We said (to them), \"You be the apes, despised and spurned","2:66":"We turned them into an (eye opening) example for their generation, and for others to follow. (We turned them into) an admonition for the pious","2:67":"And (remember that incident) when Musa said to his people, \"Allah, in fact, commands you to slaughter a cow.\" They said, \"Are you joking with us?\" (Musa) said, \"I seek refuge with Allah that I would be so ignorant","2:68":"They said, \"(Oh Musa), call your Lord for us and have Him ascertain for us, (exactly) what is it (that He wants slaughtered)?\" Musa said, \"In fact, He says that the cow should neither be too old nor too young, but rather of an age between the two extremes. Now carry out what you are told","2:69":"(Again) they said, \"(Oh Musa), call your Lord for us, and have Him ascertain for us its color.\" (Musa) said, \"He says that the cow is yellow; bright and brilliant yellow that delights the onlookers","2:70":"They said, \"Call your Lord (again) for us to ascertain (exactly) which (cow) is it? In fact, all cows look alike to us. If Allah wills, we would of course be guided aright (and would find the right cow)","2:71":"(Musa)) said, \"As a matter of fact, He says that this cow is not yoked or burdened. It does not plough the land, nor does it irrigate the field. It is unscathed, and without a blemish; it is free of faults.\" They said, \"Now you have brought the truth.\" Then they slaughtered it, but they almost didn´t do it","2:72":"And (remember) when you had killed a person and had accused each other (of his murder)? Allah was going to bring out into the open that which you were hiding","2:73":"So We said, \"Strike the corpse with a piece (of the carcass).\" Thus, Allah brings the dead back to life. He displays His signs to you. Perhaps, you would understand","2:74":"Yet, even after that your heart grew (cold and) callous; as if they were rocks. Rather, they became harder than rocks. Because, there are rocks through which springs gush forth! Moisture oozes through some (rocks) as they split apart. And there are rocks that (tremble and) come tumbling down because of the fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of anything you do","2:75":"Do you expect them to believe in you? (Such are they, that) a group of them hears the word of Allah, understands it well, and then deliberately (twists and) distorts its meaning","2:76":"When they meet the believers, they say, \"We believe!\" But when they are alone with each other, they say, \"Would you report to them what Allah has revealed to you? So they may (successfully) argue and plead against you before your Lord?

They (only) have wishful fancies and (rely upon) conjecture","2:79":"And misery is for (their scholars,) those who write a book with their own hands and then say, \"This is from Allah!\" In return for that, they acquire a petty price. Woe to them for what they write with their hands! Woe to them for what they earn with it","2:80":"And they say, \"The fire will not touch us except for a few days, if at all.\" Say, \"Do you have a pledge from Allah (concerning that)? A firm pledge that Allah will not breach? Or do you say about Allah that, which you do not know","2:81":"Of course! Those who commit evil and are wrapped (and steeped) in sin will be the inmates of the fire! They shall stay in it forever","2:82":"While those who believe and do the righteous deeds, are the inhabitants of paradise. In it, they shall live forever","2:83":"And (remember) when We entered into a pact with the children of Israel. We said, \"You shall worship none except Allah. You shall be good (and dutiful) to your parents, and kind and courteous to your kindred, the orphans and the needy. You shall be polite to people! (Furthermore), you shall perform the ´salat´ and pay the ´zakat´. But, with the exception of a few, you all turned away and ignored (the pledge)","2:84":"And (remember) when We obtained a firm pledge from you that, \"You shall not shed the blood of any of your own (people), nor expel them from their homes.\" Then, you assented and affirmed (the pledge), and you are the witnesses","2:85":"Yet, it is you who killed one another. You drove one of your groups out of their homes. With sin and transgression aforethought, you assisted their enemies against them. You demanded ransom when some of your own people were brought as captives before you. In fact, you were forbidden to expel them from their homes (in the first place). Do you believe in just some parts of the scriptures, and reject the rest? What is the fair recompense for the one among you who does that? (What else) except disgrace in the life of this world? On the day of resurrection, they are destined to be consigned to the (severest) most grievous punishment. Allah is not unaware of anything you do","2:86":"These are the ones who bought the life of this world at the cost of the life-to-come. Their torment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped","2:87":"It was We Who gave Musa the Book (the Torah). Then, after him, We sent down many messengers, one after the other. It was We Who gave Jesus, son of Mary, several undeniable proofs; and it was We Who supported him with the exalted Angels. You behaved arrogantly whenever the messengers brought something your hearts disapproved. You called some of them liars, and even killed a few","2:88":"They boast, \"Our hearts have been protected and rendered resistant to your reasons.\" (The actual words: covered with a protective layer). On the contrary! As a consequence of their rejection, Allah has cursed them; and now, very few amongst them will ever believe","2:89":"And now there has come to them a book (the Qur´an) from Allah, confirming that (book) which is already with them. Prior to this, they used to cite their book as authority during arguments with the idolaters. Yet, now that it has come to them, they reject it, even though they have recognized it (to be true)","2:90":"They have knowingly rejected the truth because of their animosity of a people, one of whom has been chosen by Allah as a messenger. Allah showers His blessings upon whomever He wishes! So, they earned Allah´s wrath even as He was already angry at them. A disgraceful punishment awaits the disbelievers","2:91":"When they are invited to accept the message that Allah has revealed, they say, \"We only believe in what was sent down to us.\" They reject everything that is revealed elsewhere, even if it is the truth; even if it confirms that which they already possess. Ask them, \"Why, then, did you kill the prophets of Allah, if you consider yourselves to be the true believers","2:92":"Musa brought to you the clear signs. Yet, as soon as his back was turned, you took a calf as your god. You surely are the transgressors","2:93":"And remember when We raised the (Mountain) ´Toor´ over you, and We took a firm promise from you. We said, \"With all your strength, hold on fast to that which We award you, and do heed the instructions!\" To that you replied, \"We heard but we shall not obey!\" Because of their rejection the love of the calf sank deep into their hearts. Say, \"Are you really the true believers? Your belief sure makes you perform despicable acts","2:94":"Say, \"If you believe that the Hereafter is reserved exclusively for you and other people shall have no part of it, then you should not be afraid to die. Let us hear you wish for death (out loud), if you are sincere","2:95":"They will never ever wish for death, because they are aware of their own misdeeds. Allah knows the transgressors","2:96":"You will surely find that they are greedier than any other people _ even more than the idolaters _ to live a long life. Each one of them longs to live the life of a thousand years. But a long life is not going to save them from the torment in any way. Allah watches (vigilantly) everything they do","2:97":"Inform the one who is the enemy of Gibrael _ (the angel who brought the revelation). It is of course by Allah´s leave that he revealed the Qur´an to your heart. It confirms that which preceded it. It is the guidance and the good news for the believers","2:98":"Whoever is the enemy of Allah, His angels, His messengers, (angels) Gibrael and Mikael (should know that) indeed, Allah is the enemy of those who reject the truth","2:99":"We have certainly revealed to you the most manifest signs (the crystal clear revelations)! No one except the immoral (miscreants) reject them","2:100":"Isn´t it always the same? Whenever they enter into a covenant (with Allah), some of them cast it aside. The fact is, most of them do not believe","2:101":"And now, there has come to them a messenger from Allah who has confirmed that which they already have with them. Yet, some of those who were given the scriptures (earlier) toss the book of Allah behind their backs. (They act) as if they know nothing","2:102":"They pursued whatever the Shaitans recited (and related) to them in the name and authority of King Sulaiman. It was not Sulaiman who disbelieved (or disobeyed). The Shaitans disbelieved (and denied). They taught people the craft of magic and that (esoteric) art that was revealed to the two angels, Harut and Marut at Babylon. Before the two angels would teach that craft to anyone, they would declare, \"We are actually just a trial for you. So do not (succumb to temptations and) be the disbelievers.\" Yet they studied from those two (angels), that which caused estrangement between a man and his wife. No one could they harm by it, except by Allah´s permission. They studied that which could only hurt them; it did not benefit them (at all). They definitely knew that the one who acquires this (craft) shall have no share in the (blessings of the) life-to-come. And evil indeed was what they purchased (and paid for) with their souls! If only they knew","2:103":"The rewards from Allah would have been much better, had they just believed and warded off evil. If they only knew","2:104":"Oh you who believe! Do not say (to the messenger), \"Rai´na\" _ (´listen to us´ in Arabic, but an insult in Hebrew). Rather say, \"Bear with us, and hear us out.\" There is a painful punishment for the unbelievers","2:105":"The unbelievers _ be they among the people of the scriptures, or among the idolaters _ would not like to see any blessings ever conferred upon you by your Lord. But, for His mercy Allah selects whom He wants. Allah is the Lord of Infinite Grace and Bounties","2:106":"We do not annul any of Our revelations nor let it be forgotten, unless We replace it with a better one, or (at least) the one similar to it.

You have no protectors or helpers other than Him","2:108":"Would you ask your messenger the same sort of questions Musa was asked earlier? In fact, anyone who chooses disbelief over faith has strayed far away from the right way","2:109":"Many of the people of the book like to convert you back to disbelief after your acceptance of faith. (They do so) because of their (egocentric) envy, even though the truth has become clear to them. So forbear and overlook (their arrogance), until Allah enforces the command. Of course Allah has absolute power over all things","2:110":"Establish the ´salat, and pay the ´zakat´. With Allah, you will find (the reward for) every righteous deed you send ahead. Indeed, Allah is well aware of every single thing you do","2:111":"They say, \"No one shall ever enter paradise unless he was a Jew or a Christian.\" These are merely their wishful fancies. Say, \"Quote your proof, if you are truthful","2:112":"On the contrary! Anyone who surrenders his entire being to (the will of) Allah, and is among the righteous ones, shall have his reward with his Lord. Such ones shall have no fear, nor shall they ever grieve","2:113":"The Jews assert that the Christians do not follow anything (that is true), and the Christians claim that the Jews follow nothing (that is true). Yet, they recite the (same) book. Others with no knowledge (of the scriptures) have also made similar claims. On the Day of Judgment, Allah will render judgment concerning all matters of dispute between them","2:114":"Can anyone be more unjust (and evil) than the one who forbids people from mentioning His name in Allah´s Houses of worship, and does his utmost to hurt them? In fact, such (unjust) ones are themselves not worthy of being let into the Holy House except in fear.

You will not be asked about what they used to do","2:142":"The stupid ones among the people will wonder, \"What made them (the muslims) face away from the ´Qibla´ they used to turn towards, while praying?\" (´Qibla´: the primal center of worship _ the direction to turn to, while praying). Say, \"The East and the West belong to Allah. He guides whom He wants to the straight path","2:143":"Thus, We have made you a balanced (and upright) nation; so you may be the witness over mankind, and the messenger would be the witness over you. We had designated your previous ´Qibla´ _ (the prayer direction) _ as a test: so as to distinguish those of you who follow the messenger, apart from those who turn back on their heels. It was (a choice) difficult (and daunting), except for those whom Allah guided. Allah is not the One to let your faith go to waste. Allah is certainly full of kindness and mercy for mankind","2:144":"(Now) We have seen your face turning eagerly (and repeatedly) towards the heaven (for guidance). So, We will divert you (away from the present ´Qibla´) and let you switch to the ´Qibla´ of your liking. (Henceforth, while praying), turn to face the direction of the sacred mosque (at Makkah). Those given the scriptures (earlier) do definitely know that indeed, it is the truth from your Lord. Allah is not unaware of what they do","2:145":"The people of the book will surely not adopt (or honor) your ´Qibla´ even if you brought them all the signs. You are not going to adopt their ´Qibla´ either. Nor do they, (the Christians and the Jews), adopt each other´s ´Qibla´. You would certainly be the evildoer if you followed their whims and wishes, despite the fact that (true) knowledge has definitely come to you","2:146":"They, to whom We gave the scriptures (earlier), recognize it (and him, Muhammad SAW,_ the message and the messenger), just like they recognize their own children.

They are the rightly guided ones","2:158":"Of course, the (hills of) ´safa´ and ´Marwa´ are among the symbols of Allah. Anyone who goes on Hajj (the pilgrimage), or the ´umrah´ (the visit), to the house (of Allah) may perform the ritual of running to and fro between these hills. There is no sin in that. It is better to perform this (ritual) on purpose.

(There are also signs) in the rain water Allah sends down from the sky. With it, He revives the dead (and barren) land back to life. He scatters all sorts of animals across the land. (There are signs) in the shifting and drifting of the winds and the clouds. They are (pressed into service and) held afloat between the sky and the earth.

Indeed, Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","2:174":"There are those who conceal (from mankind) what Allah has revealed in the book. In return, they accept a paltry price _ (a pittance, the worldly gain). In fact, they stuff their bodies with nothing less than the fire. (On the Day of Judgment) Allah will not speak to them, and He will not cleanse them (of their sins). There is a painful punishment for them","2:175":"They are the ones who bought misguidance in place of guidance, and (chose) torment instead of forgiveness. How daringly defiant! They readily risked the fire (of hell)","2:176":"This is so, despite the fact that Allah has certainly revealed the book with the absolute truth. Of course, those who dispute the book have dissented (and strayed) far away","2:177":"Piety is not (a ritual requiring) that you turn your faces towards the East or the West (during ´salat´). Rather, pious is he who believes (firmly) in Allah, the last day, the angels, the scriptures, and the prophets. (Pious is he, who) spends his wealth (in charity) _ out of love for Him _ on his kinsfolk, the orphans, the poor, and the wayfarer. (Pious is the one who) gives (help) to those who ask (for help), and (spends money) to free slaves. And (pious are those who) establish ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´, and fulfill the pledges made by them.

(If) the free man (murders), then (that) free man (should be charged). If a slave, then (that) slave, and if a woman, then (that) woman. (The offender alone and no one else is accountable). If the offender receives forgiveness from the victim´s brother (and guardian), then compliance of (the rules of) blood money and a fair award to the victim´s family is obligatory. This is the relief (and a reprieve) from your Lord. A mercy (from Him)!

If he, of his own accord, does better (and feeds more than one person), then he would do so for his own good. However, it is much better for you to fast, if you only knew","2:185":"Ramadhan is the month during which the Qur´an was revealed. It is (not only) the guidance for mankind, (but is also) the self-evident proof of (the truth of) that guidance, and (it is) the criterion (of the right and the wrong conduct). Whoever among you lives to see that month, must observe fasts (during that month). Whoever among you is sick or on a journey, (must fast) the same number of other days. Allah wants to make matters easy for you; He does not want to impose hardships on you. So complete the period (of fasting). Glorify Allah (and thank Him) for the guidance He has granted. Perhaps, you would be grateful","2:186":"And when My servants ask about Me (tell them that) in fact, I am (always) nearby. I answer the prayers and pleas of the callers when they implore Me. Therefore, they should submit to Me and believe in Me. Perhaps, they would be led along the right path","2:187":"It is permissible for you to approach your wives (sexually) during the night of the fasting (day). They are (like) your garments _ (close to you: they clothe your nakedness, and your passions) _ and you are (like) their garments. Of course, Allah knows that you (had succumbed to desire and) were cheating yourself (by engaging in sexual activity during the nights of fasting). He has accepted your repentance and has pardoned you. Now, you may have (social and sexual) relations with your wives (during the night of fasting). Seek from their company that _ (peace and progeny) _ which Allah has ordained for you. (You may) eat and drink until the white streak (of dawn) becomes visible (on the horizon) against the darkness. Thereafter, complete the fast till nightfall. Do not have (sexual) contact with your wives when you confine yourself in a mosque (to worship). These are the bounds of Allah. Do not approach them (much less exceed them). Thus, Allah makes His revelations manifestly clear for mankind. Perhaps, you would fear (Allah) and attain piety","2:188":"Do not usurp each other´s possessions unfairly _ by foul means and fraud. Do not, knowingly and sinfully, give (bribes, or false) statements to a judge (or others in authority, intending) to usurp the (rights and) possessions of others","2:189":"They ask you about the (cyclical changes in the) moon. Say, \"It serves as a calendar for mankind, and to mark the time for pilgrimage.\" Piety is not (a ritual requiring) that you enter your home through its rear. Piety is to (know and) fear Allah. Enter your homes through its front door, and fear Allah. Perhaps, you would prosper","2:190":"In the path of Allah, fight those who wage a war against you. But do not exceed the limit. Indeed, Allah does not like the transgressors","2:191":"Kill them wherever you find them. Expel them from where they drove you away. Persecution and oppression are worse than killing. Do not do battle with them near the sacred house of worship (Makkah), unless it is they who engage you in battle there. If they fight you there, then slay them (there).

If you are held back (by circumstances), then make an offering you can afford with ease. Do not shave off your head (the last of the rituals of Hajj or Umrah) till the offering has reached its destination. The one who is sick, or suffers from an affliction of the scalp, may redeem himself by fasting, giving alms, or making an offering. When you are safe (and in Makkah), and anyone wishes to perform the ´umrah´ before (it is time for) Hajj, he should make an offering he can afford with ease. But if he cannot afford to make an offering, he should fast three days during Hajj, and seven days when he returns (home). That makes ten days of fasting in all. This applies to the one whose family is not present at the Holy house of worship. Fear Allah, and know (for sure) that Allah is indeed very severe in (inflicting) punishment","2:197":"The month of Hajj (is specified and fixed, and) is well known. Whoever decides to perform Hajj (must visit the sacred House) during that month (and) must abstain from sexual relations. He must abstain from wickedness, and wrangling of all sorts. Allah knows whatever good you do. For your journey, pack and carry along with you the provisions and supplies. (However), the best provision to bring along is piety. Fear Me, oh men of reason (and intellect)","2:198":"You incur no sin if you seek the bounties of your Lord (by trading during pilgrimage). When you leave the plains of ´Arafat´ in multitudes, remember (and glorify) Allah (a lot) near the sacred ground of ´Mushar´. Remember Him as (much as) He has guided you. Prior to this, you were certainly unguided","2:199":"Then, move along with the multitude of people moving along. Seek the forgiveness of Allah.

Allah is very swift in settling accounts","2:203":"Remember Allah (a lot) during the specified days (in ´Mina´). Then, whoever hastens back (home) after just a couple of days, commits no offense. The one who stays longer does not incur any sin, provided he stays in piety. Fear Allah and know (for sure) that before Him you will all be (summoned and) gathered together","2:204":"Among people are the likes of the ones whose suave talk about this world charms and astounds you. He (professes good intentions and) invokes Allah as the witness over what exists in his heart. But (in reality) he is the most dogged and quarrelsome opponent","2:205":"When he prevails, he eagerly expends his energy in spreading mischief and corruption in the world; he destroys harvest and the human race. Allah does not like corruption","2:206":"Whenever he is told, ´Fear Allah´, his vanity (holds him back and) keeps him staunch and steady on (the road to) sin. For him, hell shall suffice!

Then, (they differed and so) Allah raised prophets (among them) as bearers of good news, and as warners. He also revealed to them the scripture containing the truth, so it may settle matters about which people had differed among themselves. They did not (splinter and) differ until after the manifest proofs had already come to them; (and they differed) because of mutual hatred (and jealousy).

Why would we not fight for the cause of Allah? We, and our children, have been driven out of our homes!\" Yet, except a few, they all turned away when fighting was actually ordained for them.

Truly, (a follower of) mine would be the one who avoids the taste of the water from the river, save a sip or two out of the hollow of his hand.\" But, except for a few, they all drank the water from the river. When Talut, and those who believed in him, crossed (the river), the others said, \"We do not have any strength left today against Goliath and his armies.\" Those who were certain about meeting their Lord, replied, \"How often has it been that a smaller group prevailed over a much larger group, by Allah´s leave?\" And Allah is certainly with the patient ones","2:250":"As they advanced to confront Goliath and his forces, they implored (Allah), \"Our Lord! Pour on us (a generous helping of) patience, plant our feet firmly and give us victory over the nation of unbelievers","2:251":"By Allah´s leave, they routed the unbelievers. Da´ood killed Goliath and Allah granted Da´ood the Kingdom and the wisdom, and taught him what He wished.

Had Allah wished, those who followed the prophets, would not have fought each other, (especially) since they had seen the clear proofs.

You cause it to rise from the west (if you can).\" Thus, the one who disbelieved was left perplexed and speechless.

He said (to himself), \"How will Allah bring the people of this town back to life after death?\" Thereby, Allah let him die (and stay dead) for a hundred years. Then, He brought him back to life and asked him, \"How long did you stay (dead)?\" The man replied, \"I stayed a day or perhaps a part of it.\" (Allah) said, \"In fact, you have stayed (in this state) a hundred years. Look at your food and your drink. It hasn´t become stale at all. Now, look at your donkey. We will turn you into a sign for (other) people.

Do not be like those who spend their wealth (in charity) solely to be seen _ (to gain public esteem). They neither believe in Allah nor in the life-to-come. Their example is that of the boulder covered by a thin layer of topsoil. When a rainstorm strikes, (the topsoil washes off and) the rock is left bare.

He should record (the transaction). The one who incurs the debt should spell out the terms. He should fear Allah and not omit anything. If the borrower lacks understanding, or is feeble (minded), or is otherwise unable to dictate, then his guardian should dictate (the conditions of the loan) in a fair manner. Call upon two of your men to act as witnesses (to the contract). Should two men not be available (to act as witnesses), then take one man and two women _ if one of them errs, the other would remind her _ that are acceptable to you as witnesses. The witnesses should not refuse if called upon to testify. Do not neglect to write down (all) the (specific) terms (and provisions) of the contract, be they small or big. That, according to Allah is a more reliable evidence, and more likely to dispel doubts (and suspicions). You bear no sin if you fail to record the on-the-spot exchange of goods for cash, that goes on between you (all the time). But, take witnesses when you enter into a commercial contract. Do not harass or harm the scribe or the witnesses. It would be wicked and immoral for you to do so. Fear Allah! (Of course) Allah teaches you (righteousness).

(That is) the reward from Allah; and Allah has the most excellent rewards","3:196":"Do not ever let the (pomp and) prosperity of the unbelievers in the land fool you (or cause you to envy them)","3:197":"(This is but) a brief enjoyment! After that, their abode is hell; it is, of course, the worst resting place","3:198":"Whereas, there exist gardens of paradise _ through which run the rivers _ for those who fear their Lord. (A generous gift of welcome) _ a hospitable reception from Allah! That which exists with Allah for the devoted and the dutiful, is much better","3:199":"There are certainly some among the people of the book who believe in Allah, and in that which is revealed to you, as well as that which was revealed to them (earlier). Humbly, they submit to Allah; they do not trade away the revelations of Allah for a paltry price. Such ones shall receive their reward from their Lord. Indeed, Allah is prompt in settling scores","3:200":"Oh you who believe! Persevere patiently, bear (hardship) steadfastly, be ready (for the right deed) and fear Allah! Perhaps you will prosper","4:1":"Oh you people! Fear your Lord who created you (all) from a single soul. (From that single soul), He created its mate, and then out of the two, He propagated (and dispersed) multitudes of men and women. Fear Allah, in whose name you seek and demand your rights. Do not sever the ties of kinship. Of course, Allah watches over you closely","4:2":"Give the orphans their assets and inheritance (when they reach the marriageable age). Do not substitute your (faulty and) valueless goods with their valuable wares. Do not gobble up their assets into your own. That indeed is a grave sin","4:3":"If you are afraid that you might be unfair to the orphan girls (in your charge), then marry (other) women you like _ two, or three, or up to four of them. However, if you fear that you cannot maintain equality and justice (among your wives) then have (only) one wife, and whatever your right hand owns _ (the captive women). That way you are more likely to avoid injustice","4:4":"And willingly pay the women (you marry) their ´mehar´ _ (the nuptial dues). However, if they, on their own, remit a portion of it back to you, then you may enjoy it with cheer and joy","4:5":"Do not entrust the (immature and the) weak of mind with the wealth and assets over which Allah has appointed you the guardian. But out of that wealth, feed and clothe them (appropriately) and talk to them in a kind and polite manner","4:6":"Keep testing the orphans till they reach the marriageable age. If you perceive them to be of sound judgment, then turn their assets over to them. Do not squander and waste the wealth in haste, lest they grow up (and demand their inheritance). The rich guardian should not charge (for managing the assets of the orphan). The poor guardian may have for himself a (reasonable and) customary share. When you turn their assets over to the orphans, arrange to have others witness (the transfer). Though, Allah is enough to take account","4:7":"Men have a share in what parents and close relatives leave behind. (So also), women have a share in what parents and close relatives leave behind. A share is ordained (by Allah), whether the estate is small or large","4:8":"If the relatives, the orphans and the needy are present at the time of apportioning (of the heritage), give them something from the heritage and say kind and polite words to them","4:9":"The executors (of the estate) should realize that if they were leaving frail young children behind (in this world) they would have grave concerns about them. So, they should fear Allah and say polite and proper words to the orphans","4:10":"Those who unjustly (and sinfully) misappropriate the wealth of the orphans, are actually packing their bellies with fire. They shall burn in the blazing fire (of hell)","4:11":"Allah gives you instructions concerning (the inheritance of) your children. The male has a share equal to the shares of two females. If there are two or more daughters (and no sons), then they shall equally share two-thirds of what is left behind. Should there be only one daughter, she would inherit half. If the deceased left children, each (living) parent of the deceased shall receive one sixth of the inheritance. If the deceased left no children, and the parents are the only heirs, then the mother gets a third; and if (the parents are not the only heirs and) the deceased has brothers, then the mother inherits a sixth. (The proceeds in every case are) after paying off any legacy bequeathed, and debt incurred. You do not know which of the two deserves to benefit more from you _ your parents, or your children. (These fixed shares are) ordained by Allah! Of course, Allah is the all-Knowing, and the Wisest","4:12":"Your share is half of what your wives leave behind, provided they have no child. If they have children, then your share is a quarter of what they leave behind, after paying off any legacy bequeathed, and debt incurred. Your widows´ share is a quarter of what you leave behind, provided you have no children. But if you have children, then their share is an eighth of what you leave behind, after paying off any legacy bequeathed, and debt incurred. If the deceased _ man or woman _ is not survived by any children or parent, but has a brother and a sister, then each of them would inherit a sixth. Should there be more than two (siblings), then they shall share equally in a third, after paying any legacy bequeathed, and debts incurred. (Let there be) no harm (to the heirs). These are instructions from Allah! And Allah is all-Aware, and the most Forbearing","4:13":"These are the limits prescribed by Allah. Those who obey Allah, and His messenger, will indeed be ushered by Him into paradise _ with rivers running right through _ to live there forever. And that is the greatest achievement","4:14":"Those who disobey Allah and His messenger, and stray beyond His limits, are the ones whom He will hurl into the hellfire. They will stay there forever. There is a humiliating punishment for them","4:15":"Obtain the testimony of four eye witnesses among you against any of your women accused of committing a salacious deed _ (an extra marital sexual act). If they testify (and confirm her guilt) then confine her to her home till death claims her, or until Allah ordains an alternate way","4:16":"Punish those of you _ both, man and woman _ who commit (such a deed). If they (relent and) repent and mend their ways, then leave them alone. Of course, Allah accepts repentance! He is the most Merciful","4:17":"In fact, forgiveness is (incumbent) upon Allah for those who commit the sinful act out of ignorance and indiscretion; those who (repent and) seek forgiveness soon after. They are the ones whom Allah will forgive. Allah is the all-Aware, the Wisest","4:18":"There is no forgiveness for those who continue to commit (and insist upon) sinful deeds (all their life). Then, as death confronts one of them, he says, \"I seek forgiveness now!\" (Likewise), there is no forgiveness for those who die as disbelievers. For such ones We have prepared a painful punishment","4:19":"Oh you who believe! It is not (proper and) lawful for you to inherit from a woman against her will. Nor (is it proper or lawful) to take back anything you gave her (as a gift) _ unless she commits an openly lewd and salacious act (an extra marital sexual act). Associate with her in an honorable manner. You may dislike her. Yet, it is possible that you may dislike something, though Allah may have placed in it a great deal of good","4:20":"In case you want to replace a wife with another, do not take back anything you may have given to her in the past, even if it were a very large sum. Would you take back (your gift) by resorting to slander and a flagrant injustice","4:21":"How can you take anything back, after you have already consummated the relationship (and enjoyed each other)? She has secured from you a firm commitment","4:22":"Do not wed the women, whom your father (or grandfather) had married. But whatever has already happened (in the past), has happened. That is indeed a lewd deed, an abominable act, a profane practice","4:23":"Forbidden for you to marry are: your mothers, your daughters and your sisters, your father´s and your mother´s sisters, your brothers´ and sisters´ daughters, your foster mothers (that is, any women) who (may) have breast fed you, and the foster sisters who have shared the breast milk with you. (Also forbidden are) the mothers of your wives, and the stepdaughters under your care from your wives with whom you have had conjugal relations. But if you did not consummate the marriage (before you divorced her), then there is no sin (for you to marry her daughter). It is forbidden for you to marry the wives of your (biological) sons (that is, those who spring) from your loin. (It is forbidden) for you to gather two sisters in wedlock at the same time. But whatever has happened (in the past), has happened. Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","4:24":"(Also forbidden are) women already in wedlock, except those (captive women) your right hand possesses. Allah has decreed that for you! Baring those already mentioned, all other women are lawful for you, provided you seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock, and not for illegal sexual liaison. Pay the women you marry, their ´mehar´ _ (nuptial dowry) _ as a sacred trust. You bear no blame if you pay the ´mehar´ and later agree upon something else (about the dowry) with mutual consent. Indeed Allah is the all-Knowing and the Wisest","4:25":"If any one of you lacks the means to wed a free believing woman, he may marry a believing woman among those (captives and slaves) your right hand possesses. Allah is well aware of your (state of) belief; you belong to one another. So, marry them with the permission of their family. Pay the women their ´mehar´ _ (nuptial dowry) _ according to the customary manner. Let the women enter into wedlock, and not have illegal sexual liaisons, nor have secret paramours. After entering into wedlock, if such women commit a salacious act, (adultery), their punishment would be half of the punishment a free woman (committing the same offense) would receive. This (exemption of marrying captive women) is for the one who fears distress (from a lack of self-restraint). However, it is better for you to be patient and restrain yourself. Allah is the most Forgiving, and the most Merciful","4:26":"Allah wants to make (matters) clear to you, and to guide you along the ways of those (righteous ones) before you. He accepts your repentance. Allah is all-Knowing, the Wisest","4:27":"Allah wants to turn towards you with (His) mercy, while those who have surrendered to their lusts want you to slide down the slippery slope (of sin)","4:28":"Allah wants to lighten your burden. Man was created weak (of will)","4:29":"Oh you who believe! Do not devour each other´s wealth unfairly _ (through force or fraud). Rather, enter into (a legitimate) trade (and deal fairly) with mutual consent and agreement. Do not kill (destroy) each other. Indeed Allah is full of mercy for you","4:30":"We will, soon, hurl into the hellfire anyone who indulges in such aggression and injustice. This is easy for Allah","4:31":"If you stay away from the major sins you have been asked to avoid, We will rid you of your minor sins and offenses. We will usher you past the threshold (of paradise) with eminence and honor","4:32":"Do not covet the honor and excellence Allah has granted some of you over others. Man shall have the reward for what they earn, while women shall have the reward for what they earn. Entreat Allah for His bounties and blessings. Certainly, Allah has (the infallible) knowledge about all things","4:33":"We have assigned the heirs for whatever the parents and close relatives leave behind. But (abide by your promises and) give the share to those your right hand has pledged. Indeed, Allah is the witness to every (pledge and every) thing","4:34":"Men are (appointed) in charge (and the caretakers) of women _ (they are held responsible for maintaining the women physically, financially, and emotionally) _ because Allah has given the one precedence over the other. Also, because they spend their means (to support the women). Thus, the virtuous women are obedient. They guard the rights of their husbands in their absence _ (the right) that Allah has upheld. If you perceive defiance (and disloyalty) from your women, admonish them, (then) keep them apart from your bed, and (then, as a last resort) beat them. If they relent and obey, do not seek the means to harass them. Of course, Allah is the most High, the Greatest","4:35":"If you fear a breach (of relationship) between the husband and wife, appoint two arbiters _ one from his family and one from hers. If both of them want reconciliation, Allah will cause a consensus between the two. Indeed, Allah is the all-Knowing, and the most Aware","4:36":"Serve Allah, and associate no one with Him. Be kind and gracious to your parents; (also be kind) to the kinsfolk, the orphans, the needy, the neighbor who is a kin as well as the one who is not, the fellow traveler, the wayfarer and the slaves (and captives). Of course, Allah does not like the conceited braggarts","4:37":"Those who act miserly, and ask others to do the same, hide the bounties Allah has bestowed upon them. For the disbelievers, We have prepared a disgraceful punishment","4:38":"And (also) for those who flaunt (and flash), when they spend their wealth, in order to show off to the people. They do not believe in Allah or the Day of Judgment. Whoever has Shaitan as an intimate companion has indeed an evil companion","4:39":"What harm could have come to them, if they had believed in Allah and the Last Day, and had spent a little out of the sustenance Allah had granted them? Allah is well-Aware of them","4:40":"Indeed, Allah will not wrong anyone _ not even worth the weight of an atom! (In fact) if there is a good deed, He doubles it. (In addition) He will award an immense reward, on His own","4:41":"(Just imagine) what will it be like (on the Day of Judgment)! Against each nation, We will call (Our messengers as) a witness. Against these people, (Oh prophet) We will call you as a witness","4:42":"That day, those who disbelieved and defied the messenger would wish that the earth was leveled flat over them. They would not be able to hide anything from Allah","4:43":"Oh you who believe! Do not come near ´salat´ if you are drunk, until you know what you utter. Nor if you are spiritually unclean (after a sexual contact) _ unless you are traveling _ until you (bathe and) clean yourself. If you are sick or traveling, or if any of you has been to the toilet, or if you have come in (sexual) contact with (your) women and you do not find water (to clean yourself), then perform ´Tayyamum´. Find a clean slab of soil and (after touching it) run your hand over your face and hands. Indeed, Allah is Lenient and Merciful","4:44":"Do you not look at those, who were given a portion of the scriptures? They use it to purchase misguidance! They want you to lose the right path, too","4:45":"And Allah knows your enemies very well. As your protector, Allah is sufficient! Allah is sufficient as a helper","4:46":"(Oh prophet), among the Jews are some, who (when they come to visit you) change words out of context. (They use pun and play upon words. They pretend to say, ´we heard and we obeyed´, and ´wait, we did not hear´. Instead, with a twist of their tongue, they make it sound (as if they said), \"We heard and we disobeyed\", and \"Listen, may you go deaf!\" and ´Raina´ _ (an insult in Hebrew). Thus, they slander the (true) faith. It would have been much better for them and more upright, had they said, \"We heard and we obey\" and \"Listen to us, and be patient with us\". Because of their disbelief, Allah has cursed them! Little is what they believe","4:47":"Oh you who were given the scriptures (earlier)! Believe in the revelation We have sent (to Muhammad, SAW), confirming your earlier scriptures. Believe it, before We (distort and) blot out your faces and make them reel backwards. Or We may lay a curse on them like We cursed the people of the Sabbath-breakers. The command of Allah always comes to pass","4:48":"In fact, Allah does not forgive ´shirk´ _ (an act of associating others as equal to Him). Baring that, He may forgive anything He wants, and whomever He pleases. The one who commits ´shirk´ has indeed invented a singularly sinister sin","4:49":"Haven´t you seen those, who (boast and) claim sanctity for themselves? It is, in fact, Allah Who (purifies and) sanctifies whomever He wants. They shall not be wronged _ not even worth a fibril on a date-stone","4:50":"See how they make up lies about Allah? That, of itself, is a flagrant sin","4:51":"Haven´t you seen those who were granted a portion of the scriptures? They believe in superstition and (they rally around) ´Taghut´ _ (entities and institutions aligned against Allah). Concerning the disbelievers, they say, \"They are closer to the right path than the believers","4:52":"Such are those whom Allah has cursed! You will not find any helper for the one cursed by Allah","4:53":"Do they have a share in the kingdom (of Allah)? Had it been so, they would not have granted people even a speck on a date-stone","4:54":"Are they envious of mankind, because of what Allah granted them by His grace? We did bestow upon the descendants of Ibraheem the book and the wisdom, and We granted them a mighty empire","4:55":"Among the descendants of Ibraheem are some who believe in him. Indeed, the blazing inferno of hell shall suffice for those who reject and turn away","4:56":"Of course, We will soon let those who reject Our revelations, burn in the fire of hell.

Yet, they seek the decisions (concerning their lives) from the ´taghut´ _ (those arrogant ones rebelling against Allah) _ even though ´taghut´ is precisely what they were ordered to reject and refute. Shaitan wants to lead them astray, and far away","4:61":"When told, \"Come to what Allah has revealed, (come) to the messenger\", you find that the hypocrites shy away in repulsion","4:62":"Why is it that, when disaster strikes because of what their own hands have caused, they come to you swearing? They say, \"By Allah, we only wanted to promote good will, and be gracious","4:63":"Allah knows fully well whatever exists in their hearts. So bear with them and admonish them with words that will touch their inner selves","4:64":"We did not send any messenger, except to be obeyed in accordance with His will.

By your Lord, they can never really be the believers unless they accept you as a judge concerning all matters of dispute between them.

They would have fared better, had they done what they were being advised. It would have strengthened their faith","4:67":"Then, We would surely have granted them an exquisite reward by Our grace","4:68":"And We would certainly have guided them towards the straight path","4:69":"Whoever obeys Allah and the messenger shall reside in the company of those whom Allah has blessed _ the prophets, the sincere and the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous ones.

Grant us by Your will a helper","4:76":"Those who believe, do fight for the sake of Allah, while those who reject faith fight for the cause of ´taghut´ _ (all rebellious forces aligned against Allah).

(But during all this time) they should be on guard and bear their arms. The unbelievers would love to catch you unawares and neglectful of your weapons and your belongings, so they can launch a surprise attack and route you with a single swoop.

So do not be afraid of people; rather fear Me!\" (Oh Jews), do not trade away My revelations for a paltry price _ (the worldly gain). Those who fail to direct their affairs according to what Allah has revealed, are indeed the unbelievers","5:45":"In the Torah, We had prescribed for them (the principle): A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth. And for wounds inflicted, a fair retaliation is proper (and due). But if the victim forgoes (the right to retaliate), then that act of charity would be the atonement for his sins. Unjust and evil are those who fail to direct their affairs according to what Allah has revealed","5:46":"And We caused Jesus, son of Mary to follow in the footsteps of the prophets. He confirmed the scriptures _ the Torah, that was there before him. To him, We gave the Gospels which confirmed the guidance and the light revealed in the earlier book _ the Torah. It contained the guidance and the admonition for the pious","5:47":"The people of the Gospel should decide their affairs according to what Allah has revealed in the Gospel. Wicked and evil are those who fail to render judgment according to what Allah has revealed","5:48":"And, (Oh Muhammad, SAW) We have revealed to you the truth in this book _ (the Qur´an). It confirms the scriptures that were (revealed) before it, and it supercedes them. So judge between them according to what Allah has revealed to you. Do not deviate from the truth that has come to you, by yielding to their whims and wishes. For each (of the three groups) we laid down the law and a prescribed program. Had Allah wanted, He could have made you (all) into a single nation. But (He did not), so He may test you all according to what He has granted you. So rush towards _ and compete with each other for _ the righteous deeds. Towards Allah shall you all return! Then, He will tell you about all that you used to dispute","5:49":"So judge between them according to what Allah has revealed to you, and do not follow their whims and wishes. Beware of them, lest they entice you away from anything Allah has revealed to you. If they turn away, you would know that in fact Allah intends to inflict a suffering upon them for some of their sins. Indeed, most people are disobedient (and wicked)","5:50":"Do they, then, seek the rules (and rites) of the (pagan) ignorance (of earlier days)? For a nation with faith, who could be a better Judge (and Guide), if not Allah","5:51":"Oh you who believe! Do not accept the Jews and the Christians as your friends. They are each other´s friends. Whoever befriends them is actually one of them. Indeed Allah does not guide the unjust people","5:52":"Yet, you will see that those with disease (of doubt) in their heart would (always) rush to (befriend) them. They say, \"We are concerned that the fortunes will change and a disaster will strike us.\" But perhaps Allah will grant you victory, or grant you another favor by His grace. Then, these people would feel sorry for the secrets they hold within their hearts","5:53":"The believers will say, \"Are these the ones who swore by Allah so solemnly that indeed, they will stand by you?\" Their deeds came to naught and they turned out to be the real losers","5:54":"Oh you, the believers! If anyone of you forsakes (and renounces) his faith, (he should know that) Allah will soon bring another people (in your place). Those whom He loves, and who would love Him! They would be lenient and tolerant towards the believers, and stern and unyielding with the unbelievers. They would strive their utmost for the cause of Allah, and would not fear the censure of the critics and the faultfinders. Such is the grace of Allah, which He bestows upon whom He wills. Allah is Boundless and Infinite, and all-Knowing","5:55":"In fact, your patron and protector can only be Allah, His messenger and other believers _ those who establish the ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´, and kneel humbly (before Allah)","5:56":"Those who accept Allah, His messenger and other believers as their patrons and protectors (will find that) only the party of Allah will triumph","5:57":"Oh you who believe! Do not accept as your friends those who mock your faith and treat it as a joke, whether they are among those given the book before you (the Christians and the Jews), or other unbelievers. Fear Allah (exclusively) if you really are the believers","5:58":"As you sound the call for (people to come to) ´salat´, they cut jokes and make fun of it. That is because they are a people who do not use their reason","5:59":"Say, \"Oh people of the book! Are you hostile and vengeful towards us just because we believe in Allah, and that which was revealed to us, and revealed before us? Indeed, most of you are truly wicked","5:60":"(Say), \"Shall I tell you about the recompense from Allah which is certainly far worse? (Deserving a worse fate are): those whom Allah has cursed, those upon whom fell the wrath of Allah, those whom Allah turned into monkeys and pigs, and the devotees of the arrogant and the evil. Their plight is the worst; they are the farthest away from the straight path","5:61":"When they come to you they say, \"We believe\" but in fact they came with disbelief (and doubt), and they left much the same way. Allah is well aware of everything they conceal","5:62":"You see most of them hurrying (happily and eagerly) towards sin and transgression. They consume forbidden (food and illegitimate) gains. Despicable indeed is what they have been doing","5:63":"Why do their rabbis and their religious scholars not forbid them from uttering sinful (blasphemous) words, and from consuming prohibited (food and illegitimate) gains? Despicable, indeed, is what they devise","5:64":"The Jews say, \"Allah´s hands are shackled.\" On the contrary, their (own) hands are chained and restrained; and accursed are they for what they say. In fact, His hands are unimpeded and outstretched; He dispenses (His bounties) as He wills. The fact is, what your Lord has revealed to you has rather increased the (attitude of) rebellion and disbelief in most of them. (Therefore), We have instilled hatred and hostility among them till the day of resurrection. Whenever they foment the flames of war, Allah snuffs them out. They (always) strive to spread corruption in the world. Allah does not like those who spread corruption","5:65":"Had the people of the book believed and feared, We would have rid them of their sins (and their faults and flaws), and (We) would have ushered them into the blessing-filled paradise","5:66":"Had they put into practice the Torah, the Gospel, and other revelations sent to them by their Lord, they would have received bounties from (the heavens) above and from (the earth) under their feet. Some of them do pursue the right course, but what most of them practice is evil","5:67":"Oh messenger! Proclaim (and spread far and wide) the revelation sent to you by your Lord. If you fail to do that, you would have failed to convey the message. Allah will protect you against (the mischief of) mankind. Allah certainly does not guide the nation that disbelieves","5:68":"Say, \"Oh people of the book! You are not at all rightly guided unless you put into practice the Torah, the Gospel, and other revelations sent to you by your Lord.\" (Oh Muhammad, SAW) the fact is, what your Lord has revealed to you has rather increased the (attitude of) rebellion and disbelief in most of them. Do not grieve or feel sorry for the unbelieving nation","5:69":"(Oh) those (of you) who believe, and those who became the Jews, the Sabians and the Christians! Whoever believes in Allah, the Last Day, and does the righteous deeds shall have no fear. Nor shall he ever grieve (or be sorry)","5:70":"We certainly took a solemn pledge from the children of Israel, and sent messengers towards them. But they disbelieved (and disobeyed) whenever the messengers brought them a command that was against their wishes and desires. Some of the messengers they rejected and belied, others they (rebelled against and) killed","5:71":"They assumed that they would never be tried (or punished). So they opted to be blind and (turned a) deaf (ear). Even then, Allah forgave them (repeatedly). Yet, most of them stayed blind and deaf. Allah observes everything they do","5:72":"Those who say, ´Allah is actually Christ, son of Mary´ have most certainly committed a blasphemy. Christ had said, \"Oh children of Israel worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord! In fact Allah has banned paradise for anyone who associates partners with Allah. Fire shall be his abode. The evildoers shall have no helpers","5:73":"Those who say, \"Allah is the third of three (the Trinity)\" have most certainly committed a blasphemy. There is no god except the One true God _ Allah! A painful punishment will surely torment those disbelievers who do not quit making such (blasphemous) statements","5:74":"Why don´t they repent and turn to Allah for forgiveness? Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","5:75":"Christ, son of Mary was no more than a messenger! Many messengers have passed before his time. His mother was a righteous woman and (like all mortals) both of them had to eat (to live). See how clear have We made Our signs for them!

Allah (on the other hand) hears-all and knows-all","5:77":"Say, \"Oh people of the book, do not (overstate and) exaggerate anything in your faith. Do not stretch (and falsify) the truth. Do not be swayed by the whims and conjectures of the earlier nations, who themselves strayed and misled many. They are far removed from the straight (and steady) path","5:78":"The disbelievers of the children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David, and of Jesus son of Mary. This is because they (disobeyed and) strayed beyond the bounds","5:79":"They failed to forbid each other from committing the wrongful wicked deeds. What they used to do was definitely hideous","5:80":"(Today) you will find that most of them have taken the unbelievers as their allies. Evil indeed is what their souls have (attained and) sent ahead (for reckoning). Allah´s wrath is upon them, and they shall stay in the torment forever","5:81":"If they had believed in Allah, the prophet, and the revelations sent to them, they would not have taken the unbelievers as their friends. But many of them are wicked","5:82":"You will find that, compared to any other people, the Jews and the idolaters are definitely more hostile towards the believers. You will (also) find that for the believers, (the least hostile and) the friendliest people are those who say, \"We are Christians\". This is because, among them are many learned persons, monks and others who are not proud","5:83":"When they listen to the revelations received by the messenger (Muhammad, SAW), you will see their eyes overflowing with tears. They recognize the truth and cry out, \"Our Lord, we believe! Include us among those who bear witness","5:84":"Why should we not believe in Allah and the truth that has come to us? We are indeed eager for our Lord to count us among the righteous people","5:85":"Because of what they said, Allah would reward them with paradise, through which run the rivers. There, they will live forever! Such is the reward for the righteous","5:86":"While those who reject and refuse to believe Our revelations shall be the people of the hellfire","5:87":"Oh you who believe!

Indeed Allah does not like (the transgressors) _ those who trespass beyond the bounds","5:88":"Partake of the lawful and wholesome sustenance Allah has granted you. Fear Allah, in Whom you (profess to) believe","5:89":"Allah will not hold you responsible for whatever is not meant or deliberate in your oaths. But He will take you to task for whatever you swear to and pledge in earnest. The penalty for that, (breaking your pledge), consists of either the feeding of ten poor people with the food you would give your own family on an average (day), or providing them with clothing; or the freeing of a slave. The one who cannot afford any of that, may observe fasts for three days. That is the atonement for breaching your sworn pledges. So observe and abide by your oaths. Thus, Allah makes His message manifest for you, so you would be grateful","5:90":"Oh you who believe! The liquor (and all intoxicants), the games of chance, idols (and shrines), and all divining devices _ (lots, cards, dices, crystal balls) _ are the filthy handiwork of Shaitan, stay away from them, so that you may succeed","5:91":"In fact, by means of intoxicants and gambling, Shaitan seeks to sow hatred and hostility among you, and seeks to keep you from the remembrance of Allah and the ´salat´.

Should you turn away, remember that Our messenger is responsible only to convey and make the message manifest","5:93":"The believers who acted righteously bear no sin for anything they ate (in the past), so long as they are dutiful (now), stay steadfast in belief and do the right thing. Therefore, be mindful of your duties and believe. Again, fear Allah and be righteous","5:94":"Oh you who believe! Allah will surely put you through a trial (during the pilgrimage) by letting the game animals wander within your easy grasp, and within the range of your spears. Thus Allah will mark those who fear Him, despite the fact that they are unable to see Him. There shall be a painful punishment for anyone who strays beyond the bounds thereafter","5:95":"Oh you who believe! Do not kill (or hunt) a game animal while you are in a state of ´Ihram´ _ (the attire of pilgrimage). The penance for anyone of you who hunts (during ´Ihram´) is an offering at the Kaaba similar to what was killed _ as judged by two just men among you. The atonement (for that act) is the feeding of the poor, or fasting for an equivalent number of days, so he may taste the consequence of his evil act. Allah forgives whatever has happened in the past, but He will exact retribution if anyone repeats (the offense). Allah is the most Powerful; He is the Lord of Revenge","5:96":"Lawful for you to hunt is the fish _ the game from the sea (or other bodies of water) to eat or to carry with the caravan.

As a result they lost their faith","5:103":"Allah did not sanction (a special status for) the ´Bahirah´, the ´Saiba´, the ´Wasilah´, or the ´Haam´ _ (animals with characteristics revered by the pagans). Rather, the unbelievers made up such lies about Allah. Most of them just have no sense","5:104":"When they are told, \"Come to what Allah has revealed, come to the prophet\" they say, \"Whatever we found our forefathers doing is good enough for us.\" Even though their forefathers knew nothing at all, nor were they guided","5:105":"Oh you who believe! You are liable for your own selves. Those who go astray cannot harm you a bit, provided you follow the guidance. Towards Allah is the ultimate return for all of you. Then, He will tell you everything you used to do","5:106":"Oh you who believe! If you find death close at hand, and you want to make out your last will, appoint as witnesses, two just men among you _ or among other people, should the calamity strike while you happen to be traveling.

Let them swear by Allah (saying), \"Our testimony is truer and more valid than their testimony, and we do not stray beyond the bounds (of truth). Else, we would be the evil doers","5:108":"That way, it is more likely that they will bear witness (properly and truthfully) as they should. They will fear that sworn testimony of others might contradict their own sworn testimony. Fear Allah and listen (carefully)! Allah does not guide the evil disobedient nation","5:109":"The day Allah assembles (all) the messengers, He will ask them, \"What response did you receive (from your people)?\" They would say, \"We have no knowledge. Indeed, You (alone) are the All-knower of all things hidden and unseen","5:110":"(That day) Allah will say, \"Oh Jesus, son of Mary! Recall the favors I bestowed upon you and your mother. I aided you with the Holy Spirit (the angel Gibrael), and you spoke to mankind as an infant, and also as an adult. I taught you the art of writing, and the insight; and the Torah and the Gospel. You shaped clay into the likeness of a bird, and as you breathed into it, by My leave it turned into a real bird. You restored the sight of the born blind, and you cured lepers by My leave. You brought the dead back to life by My leave. (Remember also that) I restrained the children of Israel and kept them from (hurting) you. (Although) you brought them the clear incontrovertible proofs, yet the disbelievers among them (dismissed all the proofs and) said, \"This is nothing but evident magic","5:111":"When I inspired the disciples (of Jesus), \"Believe in Me and My messengers\", they said, \"We believe!

For, You are (absolutely) the very Best of the providers","5:115":"Allah said, \"I am going to send it down for you. But if any of you disbelieves after that, I will punish him with the torment the like of which I have never inflicted upon any one in the universe","5:116":"Allah will say (on the Day of Judgment), \"Oh Jesus, son of Mary! Did you ever instruct people, \"Worship me and my mother as two other gods along with Allah\"? Jesus will answer, \"Exalted are You! It is not my place to say anything I have no right (to say).

Then, they would not be given the loose rein, and a leeway","6:9":"If We had sent down an angel, We would have sent him as a human. Thus, they would have had doubts again, just like they do now","6:10":"Certainly, many messengers have been mocked before you, but those who made fun of them were surrounded and overwhelmed by the very thing they used to mock","6:11":"Say, \"Move about in the land and observe how severe was the final outcome for all those who denied the truth","6:12":"Ask them, \"To whom belongs everything in the heavens and on earth?\" Say, \"To Allah!\" He has mandated mercy upon Himself. He would most certainly (bring you back to life and) gather all of you together on the day of Resurrection. There is no doubt about it!

Do you not understand","6:33":"We do know that their remarks cause you grief. But it is not just you they are calling a liar. Rather, these evildoers have actually rejected the revelations of Allah","6:34":"Certainly the messengers before you had also been called liars. They remained patient (and steadfast) despite the denials and persecution. Finally Our help arrived for them. Of course, nobody can revise or reverse the decisions (and decrees) of Allah! The tales of the (earlier) messengers have certainly reached you","6:35":"If their attitude is so hard for you to bear, then dig a tunnel through the earth if you can; or find a ladder (to climb) up to the sky.

So, do not be like the foolish and the ignorant","6:36":"In fact, only those who care to listen attentively can respond (to the call). As for the dead, Allah will bring them to life, and then they would be presented before Him (for reckoning)","6:37":"They ask, \"Why was a sign from his Lord not sent along with him.\" Say, \"Of course, Allah has the power to bestow such a sign.\" But most of them have no knowledge","6:38":"(A sign for you): all the animals and creatures moving on earth as well as all the birds flying in the air on their wings, exist as distinct species and families just like your own.

At that time, you will forget the partners you now associate with Him","6:42":"We had certainly sent (messengers) to many nations before you. We inflicted those nations with adversity and suffering, so that they might (believe and) adopt humility","6:43":"Why did they fail to (believe and) adopt humility when Our punishment struck them? On the contrary, their hearts grew (cold and) hard. Shaitan adorned and let their deeds seem adorable to them","6:44":"Once they (completely ignored and) forgot what they were asked to remember, We flung open for them the gates of everything pleasant and prosperous. They were well pleased and contented with everything they were granted. Then We seized them unawares, and they sank into a state of (deep depression and) helplessness","6:45":"Thus, the people who committed evil were weeded out completely; their roots were severed off. All praise is for Allah, the Lord of the universe","6:46":"Say, \"Have you (ever) considered? What if Allah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed off your heart? Is there a god besides Allah, who could give you back these senses?\" Observe, how We explain the revelations in detail. Yet, they turn away (disdainfully)","6:47":"Say, \"What do you think? What if the punishment of Allah creeps up on you surreptitiously, or lands on you openly?

Perhaps, they would fear Him","6:52":"Do not drive away those who invoke their Lord every morning and afternoon and seek His pleasure. You bear no responsibility for anything on their account. Nor shall they be held accountable for anything on your behalf. You would be the unjust, if you drive them away","6:53":"Thus, We test some of them by means of others. That is why they say, \"Are these the ones among us whom Allah has chosen over us?\" Isn´t Allah better Aware of the grateful ones","6:54":"When those who believe in Our revelations come to (visit) you say, \"Assalam Alaikum (peace upon you)\". Your Lord has decreed mercy (and compassion) upon Himself. Indeed, if any one of you commits a wrong deed (by mistake and) out of ignorance and thereafter repents and mends his ways, (he would find that) He is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","6:55":"In this manner, We explain Our revelations in detail, so that the ways of the criminals would become (widely known and) well recognized","6:56":"Say, \"I have been forbidden to worship those beings you invoke other than Allah.\" Say, \"I would certainly be (gravely) misguided if I follow your vain desires; I would not be on the right path","6:57":"Say, \"I have the clear proof from my Lord, while you have rejected it. The doom you so impatiently dare is not within my power to inflict. The decision rests solely with Allah. He declares the truth and He is the very Best of the judges","6:58":"Say, \"If I could inflict upon you the punishment you so eagerly dare, the matter between me and you would have (long) been settled. Allah is very well aware of the evil doers","6:59":"He holds the keys to all the unseen (transcendental) mysteries _ (matters beyond human perception). Except Him, nobody knows about them. He knows everything that exists on the land and in sea. Not (even) a leaf falls (from a tree) without His explicit knowledge. Every single seed of grain, whether dry or moist _ (even that) lying in the dark recesses of the earth _ is (accounted for) in a clear register","6:60":"It is He Who takes possession of your soul at night, and He knows everything you do by day. Then He lets you wake up for the next day. (This happens) till you complete the prescribed period _ (your life span). Finally, towards Him is your ultimate destination. At that time, He will tell you everything you used to do","6:61":"He holds complete sway over His servants. He sends (angels to be the) guardians over you. Finally, when death comes to one of you, Our angels take full possession of his soul. They never neglect their duties","6:62":"And then they would be presented before Allah, their real Master. Beware! The decision is exclusively His, and He is very swift in calling to accounts","6:63":"Say, \"When you entreat Him, secretly and with humility, who rescues you from all the dark dangers of the land and the sea? (They say), \"If He rescues us from this, We would (forever) remain grateful","6:64":"Say, \"Allah it is Who rescues you from that and all other distresses. Yet, you associate partners with Him","6:65":"Say, \"He has the power to strike you with a torment coming down from (the sky) above you, or (rising up) from under your feet. Else, He may beset and bewilder you with internecine dissension and have you taste each other´s might and savagery.\" Observe, how We explain Our revelations in detail, so that they may understand","6:66":"Your people have rejected it, even though it is the truth. Say, \"I am not appointed a guardian over you","6:67":"Every event has a preordained venue. Soon you will find out the truth","6:68":"Avoid their company if you find them engaged in a derisive (and disparaging) conversation about Our revelations. Stay away until they change the subject. If Shaitan makes you forget, then part company with the wrongdoers when you do remember","6:69":"The righteous bear no responsibility for the actions of others, though they must admonish (the wrongdoers). Perhaps, they will fear (Allah)","6:70":"Stay away from those who treat their religion as nothing more than play and pastime. The life of this world has (dazzled and) deceived them. By (means of) this (Qur´an), call their attention to the fact that the soul is held in pledge against the deed it earns. They have no protector or mediators besides Allah. Absolutely, no ransom of any kind will be accepted in exchange for their deeds. Such ones would be held (responsible) for their deeds. Boiling water will be their drink, and because they used to deny, they will face a painful punishment","6:71":"Say, \"Shall we call others besides Allah _ others who can neither help nor harm us? After being guided by Allah, we would be making an about face and turning back to misguidance! In that case, we would be like the one enticed by Shaitan. He strays in the land confused and bewildered. His (sincere) friends call him towards guidance, saying, Come to us! Say, \"Only Allah´s guidance is the (real) guidance. Our orders are to submit to the Lord of the universe","6:72":"And (we are ordered) to establish ´salat´ and to be obedient to Him. For it is He, before Whom we shall all be gathered","6:73":"It his He Who based the creation of the heavens and the earth upon the absolute truth. The day (of Resurrection) shall instantly come about as soon as He says (to it), \"Be!\" His word is the (infallible and the ultimate) truth. On the day the trumpet sounds, the rule and the judgment shall belong solely to Him. He knows the unseen and the seen. He is the Wisest and the most Aware","6:74":"Remember when Ibraheem said to his father, Azar, \"Do you take the idols to be your gods? Indeed, I think you and your nation are definitely in the wrong","6:75":"Thus, We had Ibraheem glimpse the marvels of the heavens and the earth, so that he may believe with certainty","6:76":"As the night covered him with darkness, he saw a star and remarked, \"This is my Lord!\" But when it set, he said, \"I do not like those that set","6:77":"As he saw the moon rising he said, \"This is my Lord!\" But when it went down he said, \"I would surely be one of the misguided people, had my Lord not guided me","6:78":"Then, as he saw the sun rising, he said, \"This must be my Lord! This is the biggest!\" But when it too set, he exclaimed \"I (declare that I) have nothing to do with anything you associate with Allah","6:79":"Indeed, I have turned my attention with exclusive devotion towards the One Who has created the heavens and the earth. I do not associate partners with Him","6:80":"His nation began to argue with him. He said, \"Do you argue with me concerning Allah? In fact, He has already guided me. I do not fear any of the beings you associate with Him. (They cannot do a thing) except whatever my Lord wills. My Lord´s knowledge transcends all matters. Won´t you bear this in mind","6:81":"Why should I fear these beings you associate (with Allah)? In fact, you (should be, but) are not afraid of associating other beings with Allah. He has granted no approval for such an action. So, which of the two factions have a better right to peace and security, if you happen to know","6:82":"Peace is actually for those who believe, and do not taint their beliefs with wrong deeds. They are the rightly guided","6:83":"That was Our argument which We inspired Ibraheem to expound to his nation. We raise those to higher ranks whom We want! Indeed, your Lord is the Wisest and the all-Knowing","6:84":"We gave him (descendants like) Ishaq and Yaqub. We guided both of them. Prior to that, We guided Nooh. Among his descendant were Da´ood, Sulaiman, Ayub, Yusuf, Musa and Haroon. Thus do We reward the righteous","6:85":"And (We also guided) Zakariah, Yahya, Jesus, and Ilyas. They were all pious","6:86":"And Ismail, Alyasa, Yunus, and Loot! We gave each one of them preference over the rest of mankind","6:87":"And (We raised messengers) among their forefathers, their defendants and their brethren. We chose them and guided them to the straight path","6:88":"Such is the guidance of Allah. He guides whom He wants among His servants. Had they, (any of the messengers mentioned above) set up partners (with Allah), all their deeds would have come to nothing","6:89":"Such are the ones, to whom We gave the scriptures, the wisdom and the prophethood. Since they (their descendants _ the Jews and the Christians) refuse to believe (their own books), We have entrusted another nation with that (same message) _ those who do not disbelieve","6:90":"They (the messengers mentioned above) are the ones whom Allah had guided. (Oh Muhammad, SAW), emulate and follow (as well as convey) the message (to others). Say, \"I do not ask you for (a fee or) a reward for this. It is the reminder for the entire mankind","6:91":"They did not value and venerate Allah as much as He rightfully deserves, when they said, \"Allah has not revealed anything to any man!\" Ask them, \"Who revealed the book that Musa had brought to the people? The light and Guidance that you have transcribed on parchment! Some of it you display, but most of it you keep hidden. It taught you that, which neither you nor your forefathers knew!\" (Say), \"Allah!\" Then leave them alone and let them stay engrossed in their meaningless and playful debates","6:92":"We have revealed this book, (the Qur´an), as a blessing and as a confirmation of the book that came before it. So you may warn the mother of all towns, (Makkah), and those in its vicinity. Those believing in the life-to-come believe in this book, and they zealously and punctually guard their ´salat´","6:93":"Who can be more evil than the one forging lies about Allah, and saying, \"I have received revelation\" when in fact he had not received a bit of revelation? Or the one who says, \"I, too, can inspire and create (a text) similar to what Allah has revealed.\" If only you could see these wicked people going through the throes of death. The angels would approach them with outstretched hands, \"(Time to) deliver your soul! Today you would undergo a most humiliating torture because of the untruthful and unfair things you used to utter about Allah. You used to reject His revelations disdainfully","6:94":"You have now really come before Us all alone, just like We fashioned you in the first instance. You have left behind everything We had bestowed upon you (in your lifetime). Today, We do not see your intercessors with you, those you used to claim were your partners. Of course, all ties between you have been severed. Those you had relied upon have now vanished","6:95":"Indeed, it is Allah Who splits (and initiates the germination of) the seeds of grain as well as the pit-stones of the fruit trees. He causes the living to emerge from the lifeless, and He brings out the lifeless from the living. Such is your Allah! So why are you being diverted away (from the truth)","6:96":"It is He Who causes dawn to break out (from the pitch dark night). He has created the night for resting, and He has created the sun and the moon as measures (for the passage of time). Such is the destiny appointed by the most Powerful and the most Aware","6:97":"It is He Who created the stars, so you may chart the course and find your way amidst the darkness in the land and the sea. Thus, We have explained Our signs in detail for the nation that realizes","6:98":"It is He Who has brought you into existence out of a single being. He has appointed a (time and) place for you in this life, and (a time and) a place for your death. We have explained these signs in detail for a nation that understands","6:99":"It is He Who rains water down from the sky. With that water, We bring out seedlings of all kinds, which We turn into dense green foliage and finally into thick clusters of grain. With that (same water) We produce date-trees and their heavy clusters of dates hanging low. We produce orchards of grapes, olives and pomegranates. They all appear similar and yet are different. Look at the trees when they bear fruit, and look at the process of its ripening. In it are indeed signs for a nation that believes","6:100":"Although it is He Who created the jinn, yet they worship the jinn as partners of Allah. Without any (shred of) knowledge, they assign sons and daughters for Him. Sublime and Exalted is He, far above all that they ascribe to Him","6:101":"He is the Creator and the Cause of the heavens and the earth. How might He have a son, unless He had a mate? He has created all (beings and) things, and He is well aware of every single thing","6:102":"Such is Allah, your Lord! There is no god but He, the Creator of all (beings and) things! So worship Him (exclusively); He is the trustee over all things","6:103":"Vision cannot perceive Him (at all). But He reaches (and illuminates) the vision. He is the most Subtle, and the most Aware","6:104":"Proof has indeed come to you from your Lord. Now whoever cares to see shall do so for his own good, and whoever opts to stay blind does so to his own detriment. (Say), \"I am not a guardian over you","6:105":"Thus, We explain Our signs in different ways, so as to provide a proof for a nation that realizes. Lest they should say, \"You have learned that (from books or teachers)","6:106":"Follow that which has been revealed to you by your Lord. There is no god but Allah. Turn away from those who associate partners with Allah","6:107":"Had Allah so willed, they would not have committed ´shirk´ _ (i.e. ascribed partners to Allah). We have not appointed you their keeper. Nor are you responsible for their actions","6:108":"Do not abuse and vilify those whom they invoke besides Allah, lest they should retaliate and revile Allah out of ignorance. We have indeed made the deeds of each people appear adorable to them. Towards their Lord is their final destination. He will then tell them what they used to do","6:109":"They swear by Allah very solemnly that they would certainly not refuse to believe, if a sign ever came to them. Say, \"Signs are only within Allah´s power!\" Does it not occur to you that they would not believe even if a sign came to them","6:110":"We will turn their hearts and their visions away (from the truth), even as they had (turned away and) refused to believe it the first time. We will forsake them and let them wander about blindly in their rebellious arrogance","6:111":"Even if We send angels towards them (as messengers), or cause the dead to speak to them (plainly), or present all the (unseen) things right before their eyes, they would still not believe _ unless (of course) Allah wills it so. Most of them act ignorantly","6:112":"We have set up Shaitans _ among the jinn and the human kind _ as enemies against every prophet. They inspire and provoke each other with their suave and specious speech. They could not have done that, had your Lord so willed. So leave them alone with the falsehood they cook up","6:113":"We let the heart of the unbelievers _those not believing in the life-to-come _ lean towards falsehood (and be titillated by it). Let them be contented with it, so they may amass all the evil deeds they please","6:114":"Ask them, \"Now, shall I seek someone other than Allah as a judge, even though it is He Who has revealed to you the detailed book (the Qur´an)?\" Those to whom We had previously given the book, know well that it is indeed revealed by your Lord. That it is the absolute truth! So do not be among the skeptics","6:115":"The word of Allah is perfectly fair and accurate. None can dare change His decrees. He hears-all and knows all","6:116":"Most of the people of this world _ if you choose to follow them _ would lead you far away from the path of Allah. They merely pursue their presumptions; they just guess and speculate","6:117":"Of course your Lord knows best those who have strayed from His path, and He knows quite well the rightly guided ones","6:118":"If you (really) believe in His revelations, you should eat the meat (of the animals) slaughtered in the name of Allah","6:119":"What keeps you from eating the meat (of the animals) slaughtered in the name of Allah? He has already detailed for you everything that is forbidden for you _ unless you are compelled by dire reasons. Of course, many mislead others without much knowledge, and because of their own lusts and longings. Your Lord knows the transgressors","6:120":"Give up sin (in its entirety) _ in appearance as well as in essence. Those who commit sins would surely be punished according to what they had committed","6:121":"Do not eat the meat (of the animals) over which the name of Allah is not invoked (at the time of its slaughter). That is an impious and an immoral act. Shaitan certainly incites his minions to engage you in arguments (about what is, and is not a sin). If you follow them you would surely become one of those who associate partners with Allah","6:122":"Can he, upon whom We bestowed life _ he was lifeless (and faithless) prior to that _ as well as the light by which he moves, ever be like those who grope about in utter darkness and are unable to emerge? Thus, the deeds of the unbelievers have been made to appear adorable to them","6:123":"Thus, We raised the prominent ones among the criminals in every town to play their tricks. But they do not realize that they are only playing their tricks against themselves","6:124":"When a verse comes to them (from Allah) they say, \"We will not believe unless we are given the kind (of sign) that the messengers of Allah were given.\" Allah knows best upon whom to bestow His message. Disgrace and humiliation before Allah, and a torment, will soon strike the criminals because of their scheming designs","6:125":"Allah unlocks and exposes to Islam the heart of the one whom He wishes to guide. (Conversely) He constricts and squeezes the heart of the one whom He wishes to mislead _ squeezes it so hard, he feels as if he was surging up in the sky. Thus, Allah lobs filth upon those who do not believe","6:126":"This is the path of Allah _ the straight path. We have explained Our revelations in detail for a nation that heeds","6:127":"Theirs shall be the blissful abode with their Lord, and He will be their friend and protector because of what they do","6:128":"On the day He gathers them all together (He will say), \"Oh you, the species of jinn! A great many humans have you lured and led astray! Their allies among the human kind (would exclaim), \"Our Lord, we did enjoy (and benefit from) each other´s alliance, and now we have completed the term you had appointed for us.\" Allah will say, \"The hellfire is your home. You will live there forever, unless Allah wills otherwise. Indeed, your Lord is the Wisest and the most Aware","6:129":"Thus, We will appoint the evildoers as each other´s comrades, because of what they had wrought","6:130":"(Allah will say), \"Oh the species of jinn and humans! Had the messengers from among your own kind not come to you? And (did they not) recite to you My revelations, and warn you about the meeting of this very day?\" They will say, \"(Yes, and) we bear witness against ourselves.\" The life of this world deceived them, and they will bear witness that they were indeed the unbelievers","6:131":"(The messengers were sent) because your Lord would never destroy any town unjustly while its residents were unaware and uninformed","6:132":"Each soul is ranked according to its deeds. Your Lord is not unaware of anything they do","6:133":"Your Lord is Free of all wants; (He is) the Lord of Mercy. If He wants, He can wipe you out, and have another people _ whomever He wants _ succeed you, just as He raised you from the genes of a different nation","6:134":"Of course, what you are being promised shall definitely occur! You are unable to prevent it","6:135":"Say, \"Oh my people, you do as you please! I will do my part! Soon you will find out, who gets the house of the hereafter. Evildoers will certainly not prosper","6:136":"They assign a share for Allah out of the crops and cattle bestowed upon them by Him. They claim, \"This (share) is for Allah, and that is for our partners (of Allah).\" But seldom does their partners´ share reach Allah. However, Allah´s share frequently ends up with their partners. How despicable are their decisions","6:137":"Their partners have even made infanticide adorable for many of these idolaters. These partners led them to their destruction, and obscured (and mystified) the matters of their faith. Had Allah so willed, they could not have done that. So leave them alone and let them continue to fabricate falsehood","6:138":"Of their own accord, they (make certain rules and) declare, \"(The meat of) this animal and (the crop of) that field are prohibited. No one can eat its (meat, fruit or) produce except whomever we allow.\" They prohibit certain animals to be employed for farm labor (or for burden). On certain other animals they do not invoke Allah´s name (at the time of their slaughter). They invent lies against Him! Soon He will punish them for the falsehood they invent","6:139":"They Say, \"The yield of certain cattle _ (be it milk or calf) _ is reserved for our males and is forbidden for our females.\" Yet men and women can both share the calf, if it is born dead. Soon We will punish them for all they (falsely) attribute (to Him). Indeed, He is the Wisest, the most Aware","6:140":"Those who killed their children out of folly and the lack of knowledge, incurred a great loss. So did those who forbade themselves the blessings that Allah had bestowed upon them, those who fabricated lies about Allah. They have gone far astray; they are not on the right path","6:141":"It is He Who has brought into being the orchards _ trellised and otherwise _ the date trees and the fields of crops. They all bear different taste. (He produces) the olives and the pomegranates which are similar in kind and different in taste. Eat their fruit as they ripen and pay the ´zakat´ on the day of harvest. Do not be wasteful. Indeed, He does not like those that are wasteful","6:142":"(He created) some animals as beasts of burden, others for the sake of their flesh (and milk). Eat (the flesh of animals) Allah has granted you, and do not follow in the footsteps of Shaitan. He is really your professed enemy","6:143":"(He has created) eight animals (you may eat): two are sheep _ (The ram and the ewe), and two are goats _ (the buck and the she-goat). Ask them, \"Has He, (Allah), forbidden the males of these two species, or the females? And does the ban include the kids being carried by the females in their uterus? Tell me with proof, if you know","6:144":"(Of the remaining four), two are camels _ (male and female), and the other two are cattle_ (the ox and the cow). Ask them, \"Has He, (Allah) forbidden the males of these two species, or the females? And does the ban include the calves being carried by the females in their uterus? Were you really present there when Allah gave those instructions? Then, who could be more evil than the person inventing lies about Allah, and leading people astray, without any knowledge?\" Indeed, Allah does not guide the nation of evildoers","6:145":"(Oh Muhammad, SAW) say, \"In the revelation sent to me, I find nothing that prohibits anyone from eating anything except: the (unslaughtered) dead animal, blood poured forth (at the time of slaughter), the flesh of swine because it is filthy, and the sinful food presented as an offering to beings, other than Allah. But if one is compelled by dire need _ and not by haughtiness or habit _ then of course Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","6:146":"For those who became Jews, We had forbidden all animals clad with claws. We forbade them the fat of the ox and the goat, except what the animal carries around its back and the fat that sticks to the bones. We did that to punish them for their rebellion, and We certainly tell the truth","6:147":"And if they call you a liar, then say, \"Your Lord is limitless in His Mercy! His punishment against the guilty people shall not be set aside","6:148":"Those who set up partners (to worship) besides Allah will surely say, \"Had Allah so willed we and our forefathers could neither have set up partners with Allah, nor prohibited anything (against His will).\" People prior to them had disbelieved in that same manner, right until they tasted Our torment. Say, \"If you have any specific knowledge then bring it out and show us. You merely pursue your presumptions! You just guess and speculate","6:149":"Say, \"Allah has the (final and) infallable argument. Had He so willed, He could surely have guided all of you","6:150":"Say, \"Present your witnesses! Could anyone testify that it is Allah Who has forbidden (all) this?\" Even if they do testify (falsely), don´t you bear witness with them. Do not follow the whims and wishes of those who reject Our revelations _ those who do not believe in the life-to-come, and deem others as being equal to their Lord","6:151":"Say, \"Come, and let me recite to you what your Lord has enjoined upon you as your sacred duty. Do not associate anything as His partner (and equal). Treat your parents with kindness and courtesy. Do not kill your offspring because of poverty. We shall give you, and them, the provisions (of life). Do not come anywhere close to committing the lewd and lascivious acts _ whether openly or in secret. Do not take a human life _ Allah has deemed the human life to be sacred _ except in the cause and the course of justice. That, He has instructed you! Perhaps, you would understand","6:152":"Do not touch the assets of an orphan till he comes of age, except with worthy and venerable intentions. (Be just), fill the measure to its full and weigh accurately. We do not burden anyone beyond his capacity to bear. Be just when you say anything _ (bear witness or pass judgment) _ even if it involves your own kin. Fulfil the pledges you make with Allah (or in His name). That, He has instructed you. Perhaps, you would bear in mind","6:153":"That, indeed, is My path _ the (only) straight path; so follow it! Do not follow other ways because they will alienate you from His path. That, He has instructed you! Perhaps you would adopt righteousness","6:154":"And We gave Musa the book. It was complete, and contained the detailed explanation of all things for the righteous. It was the guidance and mercy, so they may have faith in the (scheduled) meeting with their Lord","6:155":"We have (now) revealed this book, (the Qur´an) as a blessing. Follow it and fear Allah! Perhaps, you would be graced by His mercy","6:156":"(It has been revealed to you) lest you would say, \"The two groups _ (the Christians and the Jews) _ before our times had received the book while we remained ignorant and unaware of its study and knowledge","6:157":"So that you cannot (offer excuses and) say, \"Had the book been revealed to us, We would have followed its guidance better than the two earlier groups.\" The proof from your Lord has now come to you. It is the guidance and mercy! Can anyone be more evil than those who reject and shun Our revelations. Because of their aversion We will soon inflict a treacherous torment upon those who turned away from Our revelations","6:158":"Now what are they waiting for? Do they expect the angels to come to them (with their death warrants)? Or for your Lord (Himself) to show up? Or any one of the (final and manifest) signs from your Lord to appear? (Professing) belief on the day any such signs appear will not benefit those who had not believed earlier, nor those who had failed to earn any good deeds with their belief. Say to them, \"Go ahead and wait! We too shall wait with you","6:159":"Indeed, you have nothing to do with those who cause schisms, and divide their faith into sects. The decision in their case rests with Allah; He will (pass His verdict and) tell them what they used to do","6:160":"Whoever earns one good deed, shall receive ten such deeds (to his credit), while whoever commits an evil deed will only be punished equal to a single offense. They shall not be wronged","6:161":"Say, \"In fact my Lord has guided me to the straight path. It is the true eternal faith, and the religion of the community of Ibraheem who worshipped Allah to the total exclusion of all others.

Little do you thank","7:11":"We certainly created you, and then gave you (a human) form.

He wanted to expose their nakedness to them, which was kept hidden from them. He said (to them), \"Your Lord forbade you (the fruit of) this tree, so you would not turn into angels or become immortal","7:21":"He swore to the two, saying, \"I am really your well-wisher","7:22":"With deceit and deception, he brought about their fall. When they tasted the (fruit of that) tree, their nakedness became visible to them. They began to cover their nakedness with the leaves of paradise. Their Lord called out, \"Didn´t I forbid you that tree? Didn´t I warn you both that Shaitan is your professed enemy","7:23":"Both of them cried out, \"Our Lord, we committed a sin against ourselves! Now, if You did not forgive us, and have mercy on us, we would surely be the losers","7:24":"(The Lord) said, \"Get out of here! Both of you _ (humans and Shaitans) _ are each other´s enemy. For a (specified) time, your abode and your provisions shall be on earth","7:25":"Said, \"There shall you live, and there shall you die; and from there you shall be raised back to life (on the Day of Judgment)","7:26":"Oh children of Adam, We have granted you garments to cover your nakedness, and as means of adornment for you. The best attire is that of piety. This (in itself) is one of the signs of Allah. Perhaps, they would bear (that) in mind","7:27":"Oh children of Adam! Do not let Shaitan entice you as he did your (primordial) parents when he got them expelled from paradise. He stripped them of their clothes, in order to expose their nakedness to them. Of course, Shaitan and his tribe watch you from where you cannot see them. Of course, We let the Shaitans be the friends of those who do not believe","7:28":"And when they commit an obscene and lewd act, they say, \"We found our ancestors doing that, and Allah has enjoined that upon us.\" Say, \"Absolutely not! Allah never (ever) commands anything lewd and obscene. Do you attribute such lies to Allah, about which you know (absolutely) nothing","7:29":"Say, \"My Lord enjoins justice. In every place of worship, set your faces (and attention) towards Him. Invoke Him with sincerity and devotion, by making faith His exclusive domain. You would return to life just like He created you (the first time)","7:30":"One group He has guided. Misguidance became the lot of the other group. (Because), they accepted Shaitans to be their patrons and protectors instead of Allah! And they believe that they are on the right path","7:31":"Oh children of Adam! At every place of worship, wear your (best clothes as) adornments. Eat and drink but do not waste. In fact, He does not like those who are wasteful","7:32":"Say, \"Who forbade adornments, and the wholesome edible things Allah has produced for His servants?\" Say, \"They are for the believers in the life of this world. On the Day of Judgment, such things shall be theirs exclusively.\" Thus, We explain Our verses in detail for a nation that knows","7:33":"Say, \"In fact, my Lord has forbidden all kinds of lewd and obscene acts whether committed openly or in secret: (all sorts of) sins and wrongful oppressions, associating anything (or anyone) with Allah for which He has revealed no sanction, and attributing to Allah that about which you know nothing","7:34":"Every nation has been ordained a (fixed) time (to accept or reject the divine truth). Once their time has come, they cannot delay nor advance it by (even as much as) an hour","7:35":"Oh children of Adam! Messengers will surely come to you from among your own, and they will relate My revelations to you. Then, those who refrain from evil and mend their ways shall have nothing to fear; nor shall they (ever) grieve (or be sorry)","7:36":"And there are those who reject Our revelations, and treat them with disdain and arrogance. Such are the people of the (hell) fire. They shall live there forever","7:37":"Could anyone be more evil than the one who invents lies about Allah or rejects His revelations? Such ones would continue to receive their apportioned provisions according to the book of decrees (right until their death). When Our messengers, (the angels of death), come to them to claim their souls, they would ask, \"Now, where are all those you used to pray to and worship, instead of Allah?\" They would reply, \"All of them have all vanished and deserted us.\" Thus, they would bear witness against themselves, that they were indeed the unbelievers","7:38":"Allah will say, \"Enter the fire along with the generations of humans and jinn that lived before you. As it enters (the hellfire), each generation will curse the group ahead of it. Finally, when they are all together in the fire, each succeeding generation will say about the one preceding it, \"Our Lord, these are the ones who led us astray. Give them twice the torment by the (hell) fire.\" (Allah) will say, \"There is twice the torment for each one of you, but you (just) do not realize","7:39":"Each preceding generation will say to the one following it, \"You do not have an advantage over us. Now taste the torment in return for what you have wrought","7:40":"Indeed, the gates of heaven shall not open for those who reject Our revelations, and treat them with disdain. A camel may pass through the eye of a needle, but they shall never enter paradise. This is how We punish the criminals","7:41":"Hellfire shall be the bed under them; and hellfire shall be their blanket to cover them. This is how We punish the evildoers","7:42":"While those who believe and do the righteous deeds _ and We do not impose upon a soul beyond its capacity to bear _ are the people of paradise. There, they shall live forever","7:43":"We will strip away whatever rancor remains in their heart. Rivers shall flow under their feet. They will say, \"All praise is for Allah Who guided us towards this. Never could we have found the right path, had Allah not guided us. The messengers of our Lord had brought us the truth.\" A voice will call out to them, \"You have inherited this paradise as a reward for what you used to do","7:44":"The people of paradise will call out to the inmates of hell, \"We found to be true (all) the promises our Lord made to us. Did you (also) find everything your Lord promised to you to be true?\" They would reply, \"Yes!\" Whereupon, an announcer in their midst will proclaim, \"The curse of Allah is upon the evildoers","7:45":"(Cursed are) those who prevent people from the path of Allah and seek to make it crooked. They do not believe in the afterlife","7:46":"A barrier shall exist between the two groups _ (those in paradise and those in hell). At a height would be (a third group of) men who would long to enter paradise, but would not have entered it yet. They would recognize all by their distinctive features. To the people of paradise they would say, \"Peace upon you","7:47":"When their sight turns to the inmates of hellfire, they would say, \"Our Lord, do not include us with the wicked people","7:48":"The people at the height would recognize men (in the hellfire) by their distinctive features and would say to them, \"Did all your followers and your hoarded wealth _ of which you were so proud (and used to boast) _ help you in the least","7:49":"Hadn´t you sworn about these very people that Allah would grant them nothing of His Mercy?\" (But now they are told), \"Enter the paradise! You shall have no fear, nor shall you ever grieve (or be sorry)","7:50":"The inmates of hell will call out to the people of paradise, saying, \"Pour us some water, or some of the provisions Allah has granted you.\" The people of paradise would reply, \"Allah has of course denied these things to those who denied the truth","7:51":"(They are) those who took their faith as mere play and pastime. The life of this world deceived them.\" (Allah says), \"So, today We shall ignore them just like they forgot the meeting of this day. (This is) because they used to reject Our revelations","7:52":"We have certainly given them the book, which explains matters with certainty. It is the guidance and the blessing for the nation that believes","7:53":"What they now await is just the fulfillment (of the events foretold). On the day the events unfold, those who had ignored it earlier would acknowledge it saying, \"The messengers of our Lord had brought us the truth. Now, do we have anyone to intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back to our former existence, so we may earn deeds different from what we had?\" They incurred a heavy loss on themselves and the lies they had invented, did not help","7:54":"Your Lord, Allah, is certainly the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods of time. Then He mounted the throne (majestically). He wrapped the night over the day that follows it quickly. The sun, the moon and the stars have all been tamed by His command. Beware! The creation and the command (over it), belong to Him (exclusively). Exalted is He, the Sustainer of all the worlds","7:55":"Call and implore your Lord with humility, and in solitude. He does not like those who are the aggressors","7:56":"Do not spread chaos in the land after order has been established in it (firmly and fairly). Implore Him with fear and hope. Of course, the mercy of Allah is never too far from the righteous","7:57":"He it is, Who sends winds bearing the glad tidings of His approaching mercy. We direct the wind heavy with rainclouds towards the dead and barren land, and We call water to pour down upon it. We bring out (from that land) all sorts of food with that water. In much the same manner, We will bring the dead back to life. Perhaps, you would bear that in mind","7:58":"By the will of Allah, the good and fertile land grows crops and plants with ease. But the bad and barren land barely grows anything. This is how We display Our signs repeatedly for a grateful nation","7:59":"Indeed, We sent Nooh to his people. He said, \"Oh my people, worship Allah exclusively. You do not have any god besides Him. For you, I really fear the torment of a terrible day","7:60":"The elders among his people said, \"We really think you have blundered and have obviously gone astray","7:61":"Nooh replied, \"Oh my people, there is nothing wrong with me. Rather, I am the messenger of the Lord of the universe","7:62":"I convey to you the messages of my Lord, and I give you sincere advice. I know from Allah that, about which you know nothing","7:63":"Are you surprised that a reminder from your Lord came through a man among you? So he may warn you, and so you may fear Allah and receive His mercy","7:64":"But they called him a liar. So, aboard an ark, We rescued him as well as those who had believed in him, and We drowned (all) those who rejected His signs. Indeed, they were a blind people","7:65":"And to (the people of) ´Aads´ (We sent) their brother ´Hood´. (He) said, \"Oh my people, worship Allah! You do not have any god besides Him. Do you, then, not fear (Him)","7:66":"The elders among his nation who had disbelieved said, \"We really think you are being stupid. In fact, we believe that you are a liar","7:67":"He said, \"Oh my people, I am not stupid. Rather, I am the messenger of the Lord of the universe","7:68":"I convey to you the messages of my Lord, and I am your trustworthy well-wisher","7:69":"Are you surprised that a reminder from your Lord came through a man among you, so he may warn you? Do not forget! After the nation of ´Aad´, He appointed you its successors, and He enhanced you greatly in power and stature. Keep in mind the blessings bestowed upon you by Allah, so that you would prosper","7:70":"They said, \"Did you come to us so we may worship Allah exclusively, and abandon those our forefathers used to worship? If you are truthful, bring upon us that with which you have threatened us","7:71":"(Hood) said, \"The wrath and the curse of your Lord are already upon you. Do you argue with me concerning (just) some names that you and your forefathers have conjured up. Allah has not revealed any authority for them. So wait on, I too shall wait along with you","7:72":"So, by Our Grace, We rescued him as well as all those with him, and We completely weeded out all those who denied Our revelations, and did not believe","7:73":"And (We sent) their brother Saleh, to (the people of) Samood. He said, \"Oh my people, worship Allah! You have no god besides Him. A clear proof has surely come to you from your Lord. This camel of Allah is a sign for you. So, leave it alone and let it graze freely in Allah´s land. Do not touch it with evil (intentions), else a painful punishment will land on you","7:74":"Do not forget! After the (people of) ´Aads´, He appointed you their successors, and established you firmly in the land. You occupy castles in the plain, and carve out (secure) homes (for yourself) in the mountains. Keep in mind the blessings bestowed upon you by Allah, and do not spread corruption and chaos in the land like mischief mongers","7:75":"The leaders of his nation who were arrogant and scornful, said to the believers among the down trodden and the despised, \"Do you know for sure that Saleh is the messenger of Allah?\" They replied, \"We do believe in the message revealed to him","7:76":"Those who were arrogant said, \"We of course reject what you have believed","7:77":"Then, they slaughtered the camel and flaunted the command of their Lord. They said, \"Oh Saleh, if you really are the messenger, then bring upon us the punishment with which you have been threatening us","7:78":"Consequently, an earthquake seized them. The next morning found them lifeless in their homes, lying face down (in dirt)","7:79":"So, (Saleh) turned away from them and said, \"Oh my people! I certainly conveyed to you the message of my Lord, and I advised you sincerely. But (evidently) you did not like your sincere well-wishers","7:80":"(And We sent) Loot! He said to his nation, \"Do you indulge in acts so lewd and shameful that no one in the entire world had ever committed them previously","7:81":"You gratify your sexual desires by approaching men instead of women! You are a wanton people; (you have gone) far beyond all limits (of decency)","7:82":"His nation had no answer except to say, \"Banish them from your town. Indeed, they profess to be sacred and pure","7:83":"So We rescued him and his family, except his wife. She was among those who stayed behind","7:84":"And We showered them with a (treacherous) rain (consisting of stones made of baked clay). Observe how (severe) was the outcome for the criminals","7:85":"And towards (the people of) Midian (We sent) their brother, Shoaib. He said, \"Oh my people, worship Allah! You do not have any god besides Him. A clear guidance has come to you from your Lord. So, (when selling) give the full measure and weight, and do not defraud and deprive people of their rightful things. Do not spread confusion and chaos, after order has been established in the land. This is for your own good, if you only believe","7:86":"And do not lie in ambush for the believers on every road threatening them and preventing them from the path of Allah; and do not seek to distort the truth. Remember the time when you were fewer, and He increased you greatly in number.\" Observe how (severe) was the outcome for the mischief mongers","7:87":"If a group among you believes in the message I was sent with while another group refuses to believe, then (just wait) till Allah judges between them. Indeed, Allah is absolutely the very Best of the judges","7:88":"The arrogant (and conceited) leaders of his nation said, \"Oh Shoaib! We would certainly banish you from our town, as well as those who believe in you. Else, you must return to our religion. \" He said, \"What? Even if we hate it","7:89":"If we returned to your religion, we would have invented a lie against Allah, particularly since He it is, Who saved us from it. By no means will we return to your religion, unless of course Allah, our Lord wills it so. Our Lord has full knowledge of every single thing. We do place our trust in Allah. Our Lord! Give Your just verdict (in the matter) between our nation and us. You are the Best of the judges","7:90":"The unbelieving leaders of his nation said, \"If you follow Shoaib, you would certainly be the losers","7:91":"Consequently, an earthquake seized them. The next morning found them lifeless in their homes, face down (in the dirt)","7:92":"Those who rejected Shoaib were (wiped out) as though they had never lived there at all. In fact, those who rejected Shoaib were actually the losers","7:93":"Shoaib turned away from them and said, \"Oh my people, I certainly conveyed to you the messages of my Lord, and I advised you sincerely. But how can I feel sorry for a nation that refuses to believe","7:94":"Whenever We sent a prophet into any town, We inflicted its residents with suffering and hardship. Perhaps they would adopt humility (and be unpretentious)","7:95":"Then We changed their fortune from bad to good, till they grew affluent. They (forgot Our favors and) said, \"Even our forefathers had gone through (the cycle of) suffering and prosperity!\" Thereupon, We took them to task suddenly, and they did not realize","7:96":"Had the people of the town believed and adopted piety, We would have arranged for Our blessings to rain down upon them from the sky, and blessings springing from the earth. But they rejected and so We grabbed them because of what they used to do","7:97":"Did the people of the town feel so secure that Our wrath would not land on them at night while they slept unawares","7:98":"Or did the people of the town feel so secure that Our wrath would not land on them in broad daylight while they were engaged in their pastimes","7:99":"Did they not feel afraid of Allah´s secret plan? Only the people who are doomed to be the losers feel secure against Allah´s secret plan","7:100":"Is it still not apparent to those who inherited the earth from the previous generations, that if We pleased We could punish them too for their sins. We could stamp a seal on their hearts, so they could hear nothing","7:101":"We narrate to you the stories of these towns. Their messengers certainly brought them the clear proofs. But they (just) would not believe the message they had already rejected earlier. Thus, Allah stamps a seal on the hearts of the unbelievers","7:102":"In most of them, We did not find (any commitment to) the covenant. We found most of them to be the defiant evildoers","7:103":"Then, after them We raised Musa and sent him with Our signs to the pharaoh and his chiefs. But they were unjust, and rejected the signs. So observe how (severe) was the outcome for the evildoers","7:104":"Musa said, \"Oh pharaoh! I am certainly the messenger from the Lord of the universe","7:105":"It is not befitting for me to say anything concerning Allah except the truth. I have brought you the clear proofs from my Lord. So let the children of Israel accompany me","7:106":"The pharaoh said, \"If you are telling the truth, and if you have really brought the sign, then present it","7:107":"So, Musa threw down his staff and suddenly it became a real live serpent","7:108":"He pulled out his hand (from his pocket) and it appeared dazzling white to the viewers","7:109":"The chiefs of the nation of pharaoh said, \"Of course he is an expert magician","7:110":"He wants to drive you out of your land. Now, what do you suggest","7:111":"They advised the pharaoh, \"Hold him and his brother for a while and send announcers in all the towns","7:112":"They will summon all the expert magicians in your presence","7:113":"The magicians came to the pharaoh and said, \"There would surely be a (handsome) reward for us if we triumph, wouldn´t there","7:114":"The pharaoh said, \"Of course, and you would also be close to me as my courtiers","7:115":"They said, \"Oh Musa! Either you cast your spell, or let us be the ones to go (first)","7:116":"Musa said, \"You go (first).\" As they cast their spells, they bewitched people´s eyes and struck them with awe. They conjured up an awesome magic","7:117":"We inspired Musa, \"Throw your staff!\" and immediately it swallowed up their conjured up illusions","7:118":"Thus, the truth was vindicated. Everything they had done came to no avail","7:119":"The magicians were defeated there and then. They were utterly disgraced","7:120":"The magicians threw themselves on the ground prostrate","7:121":"They said, \"We believe in the Lord of the universe","7:122":"The Lord of Musa and Haroon","7:123":"The pharaoh said, \"You dared to believe in him before I gave you the permission? Indeed, it is a trick. You (all) have hatched a (nefarious) plot to takeover the town and drive out its rightful residents. Soon you will come to know","7:124":"I will definitely have your hands and feet cut off on alternate sides; and then, I will have you all crucified","7:125":"They said, \"We are certainly going to return to our Lord","7:126":"Do you wreak vengeance on us simply because we have believed our Lord´s signs when they reached us? Our Lord! Grant us fortitude and keep us steadfast. Give us death as Your obedient ones _ (lit: muslims)","7:127":"The chief of the pharaoh´s nation said (to the pharaoh), \"Will you allow Musa and his nation to spread disorder in the land and abandon you and your gods?\" He said, \"We will slaughter their sons and spare their women. We certainly have an absolute stranglehold over them","7:128":"Musa said to his nation, \"Implore Allah for assistance, and have patience! In fact, the land belongs to Allah and He gives it as a trust to whom He pleases among His servants. However, the final outcome _ (the hereafter) _ is (exclusively) for the righteous","7:129":"Musa´s nation said, \"We were being tortured and persecuted before you were sent to us, and even since you have been with us.\" Musa said, \"Perhaps your Lord will (completely) wipe out your enemy, and appoint you the successors in the land. Then, He will observe how you conduct yourselves","7:130":"And We had certainly punished the pharaoh´s people with drought, and the dearth of food and fruit. Perhaps they would heed","7:131":"When the good times arrived, they said, \"We deserve this!\" But when misfortune struck, they associated an evil omen with Musa and his companions, and blamed them for the hard times. Their evil omen exists with Allah! But most of them do not realize","7:132":"They said, \"We are never going to believe you no matter what signs you bring us, to try to bewitch us","7:133":"Thereupon We let loose upon them the punishment of the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs and the blood _ (a succession of) elaborately manifest proofs. But they continued to display arrogance. They were a criminal nation","7:134":"Whenever a scourge landed on them they would say, \"Oh Musa, implore your Lord on our behalf because of what He has promised you. We would certainly believe you if you rid us of this torment, and we will certainly let the children of Israel go with you","7:135":"But as We eased away the torment for awhile to let them redeem themselves, they always failed to keep their promise","7:136":"So, because they had rejected Our signs, and were unmindful of them, We exacted a revenge from them and drowned them in the sea","7:137":"We caused the nation that was considered weak and oppressed to inherit the eastern and the western parts of the land We had blessed. Then, the good word of your Lord (concerning prosperity) for the children of Israel was fulfilled. We totally demolished everything the pharaoh and his nation had contrived, every structure they ever raised","7:138":"We brought the children of Israel across the sea to safety. There, they came across a nation devoted to the worship of its idols. The children of Israel said, \"Oh Musa, let us have our god like the gods they have!\" Musa said, \"You really are a foolish ignorant people","7:139":"Of course, these people are doomed to be destroyed, and everything they have ever done shall come to naught","7:140":"He (further) said, \"Shall I seek other gods for you besides Allah? Although it is He, Who has favored you and preferred you over the entire world","7:141":"(And Allah says) \"Bear in mind that We delivered you from (the clutches of) the pharaoh´s nation. They persecuted you with a dreadful torture; they slaughtered your sons and spared your women! In that was a gruesome test from your Lord, the Greatest","7:142":"We summoned Musa (to Mount Sinai) and ordained for him a term of thirty nights, and then extended it by another ten. Musa completed the term of forty nights ordained by his Lord. (But, before leaving) he said to his brother Haroon, \"Be my representative for my nation, maintain order and do not follow the ways of those who spread disorder","7:143":"When Musa arrived at Our chosen place at the appointed hour, his Lord spoke to him. Musa said, \"My Lord, let me see you. I want to look at you.\" (Allah) said, \"You will not be able to see Me. Watch that mountain! If it can withstand (My apparition) and stay firm in its place, then perhaps you can see Me. When the Lord revealed Himself to the mountain, it collapsed and crumbled into fine dust, and Musa was knocked down unconscious. He said, when he recovered, \"Exalted are You! I turn to You in repentance and I am the first to believe","7:144":"(Allah) said, \"I have selected you over all other people to grant you My message and an audience with Me. So accept what I have granted you, and be grateful","7:145":"Then, We inscribed on the tablets for him the guidance relating to all matters and (detailed) instructions about every aspect (of life). \"Hold onto it with all your strength and enjoin your nation to carry out these excellent (instructions). I will soon show you the abode of the evildoers","7:146":"I shall divert and drive away from My signs those who _ without any reason or right _ behave in a haughty and arrogant manner in this world. They will not believe though they may witness every single sign (and proof). When they see the road to righteousness, they fail to follow it, but when they see a way that is decadent or deviant, they adopt it as their own way (right away). This is because they rejected Our signs and were unmindful of them","7:147":"The deeds of those who rejected Our signs and the meeting (with their Lord) on the Day of Judgment would come to nothing. Would they encounter the consequences of anything other than what they do","7:148":"In his absence, the nation of Musa molded their jewelry in the effigy of a calf that made a mooing sound. Did they not see that it neither talked to them, nor showed them the way? Yet, they accepted it for worship; they were the evil doers","7:149":"When the matter got out of hand and they realized that they had indeed gone astray, they said, \"We would surely be the losers if our Lord does not have mercy on us, and does not forgive us","7:150":"Musa was angry and sad when he returned to his nation. He said, \"How (awful and) evil was what you did behind my back! Did you rush towards your Lord´s Judgment?\" He dropped the (inscribed) tablets and grabbed his brother by the lock of hair on his head and pulled him closer. His brother said, \"Oh son of my mother! In fact, the nation considered me weak and vulnerable. They (overwhelmed me and) almost killed me. Do not give the enemy a chance to gloat over my fate. Do not count me among the evildoing folk","7:151":"Musa prayed, \"My Lord, forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your Grace. You are absolutely the most Merciful of those who show mercy","7:152":"The wrath of their Lord, and a disgrace in the life of this world would soon land upon those who chose (to worship) the calf. This is how We punish those who invent falsehood","7:153":"Those who commit evil deeds but repent afterward (would find that) even then your Lord is the most Forgiving, the most Merciful","7:154":"As Musa´s wrath subsided, he picked up the tablets. Their inscriptions contained guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord","7:155":"Musa selected seventy men for an appointment with Us. There, a violent earthquake seized them. He prayed, \"Oh my Lord, had You so willed You could have destroyed them _ and me _ earlier. Would You destroy us because of the actions of a few foolish ones amongst us. This was only a trial from You. By that, You lead astray whom You want, and You guide whom You want. You (alone) are our patron! Forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are the very Best of all those who forgive","7:156":"And ordain for us whatever is good in the life of this world, as well as the life-to-come. We have really turned to You in repentance.\" (Allah) said, \"I strike down with My punishment anyone I will. But My mercy extends over all things. I will ordain My mercy for those who are pious and pay their ´zakat´, and those who believe in Our (revelations and) signs","7:157":"(My mercy is for) those who follow the messenger, the prophet who can neither read nor write. They will find him mentioned in their scriptures, the Torah and the gospels. He orders them to do the right thing, and to avoid the wrong. He makes the pure and the wholesome lawful for them, and he forbids them the foul and the filthy. He relieves them of the burdens and the shackles with which they were bogged down. Successful indeed, are those who believe in him, honor and help him, and follow the light (the Qur´an) that was revealed to him","7:158":"(Oh Muhammad, SAW), say, \"Oh mankind! I am certainly the messenger of Allah towards you all _ (the entire world). To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He. It is He Who gives life.

Follow him, so that you may receive guidance","7:159":"Among the people of Musa there were some who guided others truthfully and established justice","7:160":"We split them into twelve distinct clans. When his people asked for water We inspired Musa, \"Strike that rock with your staff!\" As a result, twelve springs gushed forth from it, and each tribe then knew the place of its water. We provided the cover of clouds for them (in the desert), and We sent forth for them (from the sky) _ ´the manna´ and ´the salwa´. (We said), \"Eat the pure wholesome things We give you.\" They did not harm Us a bit; rather, (by being ungrateful) they used to inflict harm upon themselves","7:161":"(Remember) when they were told, \"Live in this town, and eat here whatever your hearts desire.

The fish was plentiful in the sea on the day of the Sabbath, but on days other than the Sabbath, there was hardly any fish.

Your Lord is swift in retribution! He is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","7:168":"We scattered and spread them across the earth as separate groups. Some of them were righteous, while others were quite the opposite. We put them through the test, both (by showering them) with Our blessings, and (by inflicting them with) calamities. Perhaps, they would turn to Us","7:169":"Then, the unworthy and evil generation succeeded them and inherited the scriptures. They chose the benefits of this lowly temporal world and said, \"We would be forgiven all our sins.\" Yet, whenever the (chance to attain the) worldly gains of a similar kind came by, they grabbed it again. Hadn´t they made a covenant by the scriptures that they would not say anything about Allah except the truth? And they have studied the scriptures! The abode of the life-to-come is better for those who are righteous. Then, do you not understand","7:170":"Those who hold on to the scriptures firmly, and establish the ´salat´ (should know that) We certainly do not waste the reward of those who do the right thing","7:171":"(Remember the time) when We shook the mountain that hung over them like a canopy? They thought that it was going to come down upon them. (We said), \"Hold on to what We have given you with all your strength and resolve. Remember what it prescribes. Perhaps, you will fear (Allah)","7:172":"(Remember) when your Lord brought forth all the offspring-to-be from the loin of Adam, and had them bear witness for themselves. (Allah asked), \"Am I not your Lord?\" They replied, \"Of course, and we do bear witness to that!\" (We did that) lest you should say on the Day of Judgment (as an excuse) that you were unaware of this","7:173":"Or lest you should say, \"It was in fact our forefathers who started (practicing) ´shirk´ _ (accepted others as Allah´s partners). We were mainly the descendants who came much later. Will you then punish us for the deeds of the wrongdoers","7:174":"Thus We explain Our (signs and) revelations in detail. Perhaps, they may turn (to Us)","7:175":"Narrate to them the story of the one to whom We awarded the knowledge of Our revelations. But he cast it aside! So, Shaitan pursued him until he became one of the misguided ones","7:176":"With that knowledge We could have raised him to new heights, had We so wished. But he clung to the ground and yielded to his whims and wishes. His example is that of a dog! Whether you shoo him away or leave him alone, a dog will (always) stick out his tongue and pant. Such is the example of a nation that rejects Our (signs and) revelations. Keep narrating these tales, perhaps they will ponder","7:177":"Despicable is the parable of the people who reject Our revelations, and thereby wrong themselves","7:178":"Rightly guided is the one whom Allah guides. While those whom Allah misleads are in fact the real losers","7:179":"In fact, We have doomed to hell many of the jinn and the humans. They have a brain, but with it they fail to think. They have eyes but they do not use them to see (the truth). They have ears but they fail to hear (the truth) with them. They are (just) like cattle; in fact they are worse. Such are the heedless ones","7:180":"Allah´s are the most beautiful names (and attributes). Invoke Him by those names, and part company with those who deny (or mock) His names (and attributes).

(Have they considered that) maybe their allotted time (in this life) has almost come to an end. Then, which message can they believe in, after that","7:186":"There can be no guide for the one whom Allah leads astray. He leaves them wandering blindly in their unruly rebellious arrogance","7:187":"They ask you about the hour (of Judgment), \"When will it occur?\" Say, \"In fact, the knowledge of that rests with my Lord. No one but He can disclose its time. It is an event of utmost gravity in the heavens and the earth. It will creep up on you suddenly.\" They ask you as if you are well aware of its time (of occurrence). Say, \"Allah (alone) knows the time of its occurrence.\" But most people (just) do not know","7:188":"Say, \"I possess no power to gain any benefit for myself, nor to evade any harm; except whatever Allah wants.

Now, taste the punishment you used to deny","8:36":"In fact, those who have denied (the truth) spend their wealth in order to turn people away from the path of Allah, and they will continue to do so. Later, it would become a source of anguish and regret for them. Then, they shall be overcome. (All) those who have disbelieved shall (then) be gathered towards the hell","8:37":"So that Allah may sift the wicked from the pious. He will put the wicked one atop another, heap them all up, and drop them into hell. Such ones are (really) the losers","8:38":"Tell (all) those who have disbelieved, that (even now) if they give up (their skepticism), He will forgive their past deeds.

Allah is capable of doing everything","8:42":"(That day) you were (camped) on the near side of the valley, while they were (camped) on the farther side. Their caravan was on a lower ground than yours. If you had made a prior appointment to meet each other there in battle, you would surely have failed to keep it. (But it happened as it did), so that Allah may bring to pass events that simply had to happen. So that those who perish, might perish with a clear proof; and those who live might live on with a clear proof. Allah is certainly the all-Hearing and the all-Knowing","8:43":"In your dream, Allah had you see the enemy as fewer in number.

Indeed, He knows (even) that which lies (buried) in the chest","8:44":"When you met each other (on the battlefield), He made them appear to you fewer in number. Further, He made you appear fewer in their eyes too; so that He may bring to pass that which had to happen. All matters are referred to Allah (for decision)","8:45":"Oh you who believe! When you encounter the enemy (on the battlefield) remain steadfast and remember Allah a lot. So that you may meet with success","8:46":"Obey Allah and His messenger and do not dispute, lest you lose courage and your strength wanes. Persevere patiently. Indeed Allah is with those who are patient","8:47":"Do not be like those who leave their homes (for battle) with a great pomp and conceit, and a desire to show off. They block (people) from the path of Allah. Everything they do is within Allah´s knowledge and domain","8:48":"Shaitan made their deeds appear adorable to them and said, \"Today nobody can defeat and overcome you, for I am with you.\" But when the two armies came close enough to see each other, he took to his heels (saying), \"I have nothing to do with you. I see what you do not see. I am (really) afraid of Allah.\" Of course, Allah is (very swift and) severe in (inflicting) punishment","8:49":"(Remember), the hypocrites and others with disease (of disbelief) in their hearts said (about the believers), \"Their faith has misled and blinded these people.\" But whoever places his trust in Allah (knows that) Allah is indeed the most Powerful, and the Wisest","8:50":"If only you could see the angels taking full possession (of the souls) of the unbelievers (at the time of their death)!

They refused to believe the signs of Allah. Therefore, Allah took them to task for their sins. Indeed, Allah is very strong and severe in (inflicting) punishment","8:53":"This is because Allah never revokes the blessings He bestows upon a people unless they change their inner selves _ (their attitudes and actions). Surely, Allah hears all, and knows all","8:54":"(It is) like the example of the followers of the pharaoh, and those before them. They rejected the signs (and the revelations) of their Lord.

Anything you spend in the path of Allah will be returned to you in full. You will not be wronged (at all)","8:61":"If they _ (the enemies) _ seem inclined to make peace, then you too should lean towards it. Place your trust in Allah. Indeed, He is all-Hearing, and all-Knowing","8:62":"Allah will be sufficient on your behalf, should they intend to deceive you (by the offer of peace). It is He Who strengthened you by providing His support, and by providing the believing followers","8:63":"It is He Who caused the hearts of the believers to bind together (with love).

Urge the believers to fight (for His cause). If, among you there are twenty patient and steadfast men, they would triumph over two hundred. A hundred of you would overcome a thousand unbelievers, since they are a people who do not understand","8:66":"At present Allah has eased your burden. He knows that you (still) have weakness (within your ranks). For now if, among you there are a hundred steadfast and patient men, they would triumph over two hundred. By the will of Allah, a thousand of you would triumph over two thousand. Allah is certainly with those who are patient and enduring","8:67":"It is not (befitting) for the prophet to take prisoners (during the battle) until he had thoroughly crushed (the enemy) in the land.

Allah is the all-Knowing, the Wisest","8:72":"Indeed, those who believed, left their homes, and waged a struggle for the cause of Allah as well as those who helped them and gave them shelter are each other´s friends and allies.

However, if they seek your assistance in matters of faith, then you must help them, except against any nation with whom you have a pact of alliance. Allah (vigilantly) watches everything you do","8:73":"The unbelievers are each other´s friends and allies. Unless you do your part, confusion and chaos will prevail and a rampant corruption will wage in the land","8:74":"Those who believed, left their homes and waged a struggle for the cause of Allah as well as those who helped and protected them are really the true believers. There is forgiveness for them and a generous rewards","8:75":"Those who believed later, left their homes and waged the struggle along with you, are part of you.

Of course, it is they who are the offenders _ (the transgressors)","9:11":"But if they repent, establish the ´salat´, and pay the ´zakat´, then they are your brothers in faith. For folks who have knowledge, We explain Our verses in detail","9:12":"And if they enter into a pact, and yet violate their pledges and (begin to) malign (and defame) your faith, then fight the leaders of disbelief. Perhaps they would desist. Their oaths are not worthy of trust","9:13":"Would you not fight against the people who violated their solemn pledges and conspired to expel the messenger (from his town).

Allah does not guide the sinful nation","9:25":"Certainly, Allah had given you victories in many battles. In the battle of ´Hunain´, however, your superiority (over your enemy) because of greater number had pleased you. But it did not help you a bit. Despite its vastness, the earth closed in on you.

So give the news of a painful punishment to those who amass gold and silver, instead of spending them in the path of Allah","9:35":"That day _ (the Day of Judgment) _ their treasure would be heated up in the fire of hell. With that (red hot metal) their forehead, flanks and back shall be branded (and charred). \"This is what you had saved up for yourself. Now taste what you had amassed","9:36":"The fact is, the number of months according to Allah are twelve (in a year). It was so ordained by Allah at the time when He created the heavens and the earth. Four of those months are sacred. Therefore, do not commit a sin against yourself (by violating the sanctity of these months). Fight against the ´mushriqeen´ _ (those who ascribe partners for Allah) _ on all fronts with unity in your ranks, just as they fight you. Be aware, that surely Allah is with the pious","9:37":"´Nasi´, (the postponement of the sacred months) is another instance (and example) of disbelief, (a practice) by which the unbelievers are led further astray. They deem a month ´not sacred´ one year and declare it to be sacred the next, in order to make up the numbers of sacred months (in a year). Thus, they (find a way to) legitimize what Allah has forbidden. Such an evil course seems pleasing to them. Allah does not guide the nation of unbelievers","9:38":"Oh you who believe! What is the matter with you? When asked to (leave home and) go (into battle) for the sake of Allah, you drag your feet and cling to the ground. Do you prefer the life of this world to the afterlife? Compared to the afterlife, the possessions (and pleasures) of the life of this world are much too meager","9:39":"If you do not proceed (into battle), Allah will inflict a painful punishment upon you. And in your place, He will bring another nation. You cannot harm Him a bit! Allah has (absolute) power over everything","9:40":"If you fail to help the prophet, (Allah will)! Allah had certainly helped him when the unbelievers had driven him out (of the town). He was (at that time) one of the two. The two of them were (hiding) in a cave when he said to his companion, \"Do not worry, Allah is with us.\" So Allah, by His grace, caused the (reassuring) peace and serenity to descend upon him. (Allah) strengthened him with forces you could not see. He brought the words (and slogans) of the unbelievers down to the lowest level, while the word of Allah is (always) Supreme. Allah is the Almighty, and the Wisest","9:41":"Go forth (into battle), whether you are light or laden. With your wealth and life, wage a struggle for the cause of Allah. That is better for you, if you only know","9:42":"They would have come out and accompanied you if the mission involved a quick gain or an easy journey, but the hardship of the long journey bothers them. Yet, (when you come back) they would swear by Allah and say, \"If we could, we would have accompanied you.\" (Thus), they destroy their souls. Of course, Allah knows that they are the liars","9:43":"May Allah forgive you! Why did you grant them permission (to stay behind)? Otherwise, it would have become evident to you who is sincere and who is the liar","9:44":"Those who (really) believe in Allah and the Last Day would never ask you to exempt them from waging a struggle with their wealth and their life. Of course, Allah is very well aware of those who fear (Him)","9:45":"Actually, those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day are the ones asking you for an exemption. Their heart raises doubts and they waver in their doubts","9:46":"If they had any intentions of going into battle, they would surely have prepared for it. But Allah did not like them to go, and He held them back. They were told, \"(Go) sit (at home) along with those who (always) stay home","9:47":"Had they gone (into battle) with you, they would have caused nothing but chaos within your ranks. They would be active in trying to corrupt (the morals and morale). There are some among you who do listen to them. Allah is well aware of the evil doers","9:48":"They had sought to foment dissension and discord on an earlier occasion, too. They turned matters upside down to defeat you. But despite their hatred, the truth (victory) arrived and Allah´s decree became manifest","9:49":"Among them are some who say, \"Grant me leave. Do not put me through a test.\" Beware! A trial it is, intowhich they have (just) stumbled. Of course, the hellfire surrounds the unbelievers","9:50":"It bothers them if something good comes your way. But if a disaster strikes you they say, \"Good thing, we took precaution beforehand.\" And happily they turn away","9:51":"Say, \"Nothing will ever happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us. He is our (Patron and) Protector. The believers should place their trust (only) in Allah","9:52":"Say, \"In our case, what you await is (nothing except) one of the two wonderful gains _ (victory or martyrdom). And in your case, what we are waiting for, is whether Allah will punish you Himself, or by our hands. (So wait on) we (too) are waiting with you","9:53":"Say, \"What you contribute _ willingly or unwillingly _ would not be accepted. Indeed, you have (always) been an evil (sinful) nation","9:54":"What prevented their contributions from being accepted is the fact that they did not believe in Allah and His messenger. When they come to offer ´salat´ they are (always) neglectful and indolent. When they spend (for the sake of Allah) they do so with resentment","9:55":"Abundance of their wealth and children should not amaze you. In fact, with these (very things) Allah wants to punish them in the life of this world. (And He intends) that their souls depart (their bodies) in a state of disbelief","9:56":"They swear by Allah that they certainly belong to you (and are with you). But they are not part of you. Rather, they are a people ridden with fear","9:57":"Had they found a refuge _ a cave or a place of hiding _ they would have frantically rushed towards it; and they would remain defiant","9:58":"Among them are those who find fault with you (Oh Muhammad, SAW) concerning the distribution of charity. They stay happy if they are given a share. But any time they do not receive (charity), they suddenly become enraged","9:59":"Of course, (they would have fared better) had they been content with what Allah and His messenger gave them. If only they had said, \"For us, Allah suffices. Allah will soon, by His Grace, grant us (riches) and (so will) His messenger. We turn to Allah (with our prayers)","9:60":"In fact, the ´zakat´ is meant for the needy and the poor, as well as for those appointed to collect and distribute it. (In addition, it may be used) to win hearts over (to Islam), to free slaves and those in debt, (to wage a struggle) for the sake of Allah, and to help the wayfarer. It is an obligation imposed by Allah; and Allah is well aware, the Wisest","9:61":"Among them are those who annoy and hurt the prophet by saying, \"He is all ears _ (he lends his ears to all).\" Say, \"For your own good, he is all ears. He believes in Allah and trusts the believers; he is mercy for those of you who believe.\" There is a painful punishment for those of you who annoy the messenger of Allah","9:62":"They invoke Allah and swear before you (the Muslims), in order to please you. However, Allah _ and so also His messenger _ has a greater right, so that if they are the (true) believers they should (try to) please Him","9:63":"Do they not know that the fire of hell is for those who act contrary to (the commands of) Allah and His messenger? They shall stay there forever. That is the greatest disgrace","9:64":"The hypocrites are afraid that a ´surah´ (of the Qur´an) might (soon) be revealed exposing whatever exists in their hearts. Say, \"Make fun (all you want). But Allah is going to reveal that which you dread","9:65":"If you were to ask them, they would surely say, \"We were just joking and having fun.\" Say, \"Are you having fun (and cutting jokes) about Allah, His verses and His messenger","9:66":"Make no excuses, now. You have denied the truth, after first having professed belief. We may pardon some of you, but We would certainly punish others amongst you because they are really guilty","9:67":"All hypocrites _ men as well as women _ resemble each other. They enjoin wickedness and forbid decency. They are tight-fisted (and do not spend for the cause of Allah). They forgot Allah, and so He forgot them. The hypocrites really are the evil doers","9:68":"Allah promises the fire of hell for the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women, as well as for the unbelievers. They shall stay in it forever. It serves them right! Allah has cursed them. For them, there exists a (constant) ever-lasting torment","9:69":"(You hypocrites are) like those (generations of hypocrites) before you who enjoyed their share (of life and leisure)! Compared to you they had more power. They had a lot more wealth and descendants. So, go ahead and enjoy your share (of life) just like those before you. Stay engrossed (and lost) in play and pleasure, just like those before you. Their efforts (and endeavors) amounted to nothing in the life of this world, or in the afterlife. Such are the losers","9:70":"Has the news not reached them about the nations before them _ the nation of ´Nooh´, the ´Aads, and the ´Samoods, as well as the nation of Ibraheem, the people of Midian and the overthrown cities? The messengers brought them the clear proofs. Allah was not (at all) unjust to them. Rather, they used to wrong themselves","9:71":"And the believers _ men and women _ are each other´s helpers and protectors; they enjoin the right and forbid the wrong. They establish the ´salat´, pay the ´zakat, and obey Allah and His messenger. It is they upon whom Allah will shower mercy. Indeed, Allah is the most Powerful and the Wisest","9:72":"Allah has promised the believers _ men and women _ the paradise, right through which run the rivers. Till eternity, they shall live in the beautiful mansions, and in perpetual bliss. Above all, the acceptance and the approval of Allah are far greater. That is indeed the supreme triumph","9:73":"Oh prophet, wage an utmost struggle against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be harsh with them. Hell fire is their abode, and it is the worst of the destinations","9:74":"The hypocrites swear by Allah that they have said nothing (wrong); but surely they did utter the words of disbelief. After accepting Islam they have disbelieved! They attempted to do what they could not carry out. How hostile (and resentful) are they, simply because Allah, by His grace and through His messenger, enriched them! It would be to their advantage if they repented. However, if they turn away, Allah will torment them with a painful punishment in this world, as well as in the life-to-come. They do not have any friends or helpers in this world","9:75":"There are those of them who pledged to Allah, (saying), \"If He (ever) bestows His bounties upon us, we would most certainly spend in charity and be among the righteous","9:76":"But when He bestowed His bounties upon them, they were stingy (and they withheld their wealth). Abandoning (their oaths), they went back (on their words)","9:77":"Consequently, He planted hypocrisy in their heart right till they meet Him. (This is) because they went back on their promise with Allah, and because they used to lie","9:78":"Do they not know that Allah is well Aware of their intrigues and their secret conferences? Of course, Allah is all-Knower of the unknown and the unseen","9:79":"The hypocrites criticize the (true) believers who give charity willingly and beyond the call of duty, as well as those who find nothing (to give) except their own (physical) efforts (and struggles). They make fun of the believers. But Allah makes fun of the hypocrites. For them, there exists a painful punishment","9:80":"(Oh Muhammad, SAW) you may beg forgiveness for them, or decide not to. Allah will certainly not forgive them, even if you sought forgiveness for them seventy times over. This is so, because they really did not believe in Allah and His messenger. Allah does not guide the (rebellious) sinful people","9:81":"The hypocrites who stayed home and did not follow the messenger of Allah (on his mission) rejoice (over their inactive stance). They did not care to wage the struggle with their wealth and their life for the sake of Allah. (Rather), they said (to others), \"Do not go forth (into battle) in this heat.\" Say, \"The fire of hell is hotter and far worse!\" If only they understood","9:82":"Now, let them laugh sparingly and weep a lot; (such is) the result of what they used to commit","9:83":"Should Allah bring you back to a group of (these) hypocrites, and should they seek your permission to go out (into battle for you), tell them (plainly), \"You shall never accompany me (into battle) ever again. You shall never fight the enemy with me. You were content with sitting idle (and inactive) on the first occasion. Now, sit still in the company of those who (always) stay behind","9:84":"(Oh Muhammad, SAW) do not ever offer (the funeral) prayer for them when any of them dies. Do not ever stand (and pray) by his graveside. They certainly disbelieved Allah and His messenger, and died as evil doers (and disobedient ones)","9:85":"Let (the abundance of) their wealth and children not surprise you. By these means, Allah plans to punish them in (the life of) this world, so that their souls shall depart (their bodies) while they are still the unbelievers","9:86":"As soon as a chapter (of the Qur´an) is revealed (instructing them), \"Believe in Allah and wage a struggle along with His messenger\" the able bodied (and well to do) among them ask to be exempted. They say, \"Leave us (behind). Let us be among those who sit at home","9:87":"They opt to remain content among (the women and) those who sit behind (at home). A seal is placed upon their heart, (so) they do not understand","9:88":"But the messenger, and the believers with him, wage a struggle with their wealth and their life. Those are the ones for whom all the good things exist. Such are the successful ones","9:89":"For them, Allah has prepared the paradise, right through which run the rivers. They will live there forever. That is the greatest triumph","9:90":"Among the Bedouin Arabs, (too), are those who offered excuses and came to seek exemption (from the battle). In this manner, those who had lied to Allah and His messenger sat around (at home). A painful punishment will strike those of them who disbelieve","9:91":"There is no blame upon the weak and old, or the sick, or those who do not find any resources to spend (for the sake of Allah), provided they are (loyal and) sincere to Allah and His messenger. There is no reason to blame the righteous. Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","9:92":"Nor (is there any blame) upon those who came to you requesting that you arrange transport for them. They went back when you said, \"I find nothing to provide you with the means of transport.\" Their eyes welled up with tears and they were saddened because they found no means to pay for their expenses","9:93":"Actually, the blame is upon those who are able and well off, yet ask your permission to be exempted (from battle). They are happy to be with those who stay behind _ (the women, the old and the sick). Allah has placed a seal on their hearts, but they do not realize","9:94":"When you return to them (from your mission), they will give you (many) excuses (for their conduct). Say, \"Make no excuses. We won´t believe you. Allah has already told us the truth about you. (Henceforth), Allah and His messenger will monitor your deeds.

Turn away from them. They (really) are filthy, and hell is their abode _ the just reward for what they used to commit","9:96":"They would swear so that you would be pleased with them. You may be pleased with them, but surely Allah is not pleased with the evil doing (disobedient) folk","9:97":"When it comes to disbelief and hypocrisy, the Bedouin Arabs are the worst. They are the least likely to know the limits (of the laws) that Allah has revealed to His messenger. Allah (alone) is all-Knowing and the Wisest","9:98":"Among the Bedouin Arabs are some who spend (per your instructions), but consider it a penalty and a fine. They are waiting for your fortune to change for the worst. The misfortune will in fact overwhelm them! Allah is the all-Hearing and the all-Knowing","9:99":"Among the Bedouin Arabs are (also) those who believe in Allah and the Last Day. They regard what they spend as a means to draw closer to Allah, and (a means to receive) the messenger´s prayers. But of course, it does bring proximity (to Him). Soon, Allah will usher them in His Mercy and Grace. Indeed, Allah is the oft-Forgiving and the most Merciful","9:100":"Allah is well pleased with the foremost ones among the ´mohajirs´ _ (those who migrated with the messenger from Makkah to Medina) and the ´ansars´ _ (those who helped the ´mohajirs´), and the others who followed them in good faith.

That is the greatest triumph","9:101":"Many of the Bedouin Arabs around you as well as (many of) the people of ´Al-medina´ are hypocrites. You do not know them, but We know them (quite well). Soon, We will inflict upon them twice the punishment. After that they shall be brought back for the gravest of punishment","9:102":"There are others who acknowledge their offense. They have mixed their righteous deeds with other deeds that are bad. Allah might just turn towards them in forgiveness.

Allah is all-Aware, the Wisest","9:107":"Those (hypocrites) who built a (parallel) mosque did so in order to foment mischief, disbelief and dissension among the believers, and also to provide a retreat and a (secret) sanctuary for the person who had always waged a war against Allah and His messenger. They would definitely swear that (by building that mosque) they had intended nothing but good. But Allah bears witness that they are certainly the liars","9:108":"Do not ever set foot in that mosque. In fact, the mosque that was based and built on piety right from the first day is definitely a far better (and worthier) place for you to stand in prayers. In that mosque are men who like to keep themselves clean and pure. Of course, Allah loves those who keep themselves clean and pure","9:109":"So, who will fare better (do you think)? The one who raised his building on piety and the pleasure (and approval) of Allah, or the one who raised his building upon the brink of a crumbling water-worn precipice.

Allah does not guide the nation of wrong doers","9:110":"Such a structure they built will always continue to raise doubts in their hearts until their hearts are torn to pieces (and they die). Allah is all-Aware and the Wisest","9:111":"Allah has certainly purchased from the believers their life and their wealth in return for paradise. They fight for the sake of Allah; they slay and are slain. It is a (firm and) binding promise made by Him, and repeated in the Torah, the Gospels and the Qur´an. And who could be truer to his promise than Allah? So be happy with the bargain you have just transacted. That, indeed, is the tremendous triumph","9:112":"(Believers are) those who turn in repentance (towards Him), worship Him, praise Him, observe fasts, bow before Him (in prayers) and prostrate before Him (in prayers).

Particularly now, when it is known to the believers that the idolaters are surely the people of the hellfire","9:114":"The prayers of Ibraheem for his father´s forgiveness was only because of the promise he had made (to his father). He quit as soon as it became obvious to him that his father was the enemy of Allah.

Of course, Allah is aware of all things","9:116":"The kingdom of the heavens and the earth certainly belongs to Allah. He gives life and death. You do not have, besides Allah, any friend or helper","9:117":"With His mercy, Allah has turned towards the prophet as well as those of the ´mohajirs´ and the ´ansars´ who stood by him during the hour of hardship. But the hearts of a group of them had almost faltered and strayed. Then, He accepted their repentance. Certainly, He is full of kindness for them; He is the most Merciful","9:118":"Allah also forgives the three whose matter had been delayed. The earth with all its vastness had closed in on them. Even their own life became utterly constrained, and they realized that they had nowhere to turn except towards Allah.

Fear Allah, and be with those who are truthful","9:120":"It was not proper for the people of ´Al-Medina´, and the Bedouin Arabs living nearby, to lag behind (and abandon) the messenger of Allah. Nor (was it proper for them) to care for their own life more than the life of the messenger. This is so, because whatever actions they undertake (for Allah) _ whether they endure thirst, fatigue and hunger for the sake of Allah or take measure that infuriate the unbelievers, or inflict damage upon the enemy _ is recorded to their credit as virtuous deeds. Of course Allah does not waste the rewards of the righteous","9:121":"Everything they spend _ be it a small donation or large _ and every valley they cross (in the path of Allah) is recorded to their credit. So that Allah may reward them for the good deeds they had performed","9:122":"It is not essential for all believers to (leave home and) go out to fight at the same time.

We were, of course, totally oblivious of your worship","10:30":"There, all souls will assess their past deeds, and they will be referred back to Allah, their real Patron. None of their fabricated lies would be of any avail to them","10:31":"Say, \"Who grants you provisions from the sky, and from the earth? And who holds sway over the ears and the eyes? Who causes the living to emerge from the dead, and the dead from the living? Who regulates all these things?\" They will concur and reply, \"Allah!\" Say, \"Do you then, not fear Him","10:32":"Such is Allah, your true Lord! Apart from the truth, what else is there, except lies (and misguidance)? So, where are you turning away to","10:33":"Thus, your Lord´s word came to pass for the sinners. Surely, they are the ones who do not believe","10:34":"Say, \"Does any of the partners (you ascribe to Allah) initiates creation, and then renews it?\" Say, \"Allah has initiated the creation and He will start it anew. So, aren´t you being misled","10:35":"Ask them, \"Does any of the partners (you ascribe) guides towards the truth?\" Say, \"Allah guides towards the truth! So, which one merits your obedience? The one who guides towards the truth, or the one who does not, and instead remains in need of guidance? What is the matter with you? How do you make your choices","10:36":"Most of them follow nothing but conjectures. When it comes to the truth, conjectures do not suffice at all. Surely, Allah has the real knowledge of what they are doing","10:37":"This Qur´an isn´t a thing any one can invent, except Allah. Indeed, it confirms and expands upon the scriptures that already exist _ (the Torah and the Gospels). It contains nothing doubtful; and it is from the Lord of the Universe","10:38":"Do they say he has made it up himself? If you are truthful, bring just one such chapter; and except Allah, call any one you can (to help)","10:39":"Actually, they rejected that, (the Qur´an), which they failed to comprehend. Its full significance has yet not dawned upon them. Those before them, too, had rejected! So, observe their fate! What became of the evildoers","10:40":"There are those among them who believe, and those who do not. Your Lord is better aware of the mischief-makers","10:41":"Should they reject you, say, \"I have my task and you have yours; you are absolved of anything I do, just as I am blameless for your acts","10:42":"Among them are those who seem to hear you. Would you then, try to make the deaf hear, even though he understands nothing","10:43":"Among them are those who appear to look at you! Will you then try to guide the blind, even though he sees nothing","10:44":"Surely, Allah does not oppress people unjustly. Rather, people treat their own selves unjustly","10:45":"That day, We will gather them together. They will feel as if they did not stay (in this world) for more than just a single hour of a day, and only to get to know each other. They became the losers because they rejected the inevitable meeting with Allah! They were not well guided","10:46":"We may let you witness some of what We have promised them, or We may first give you death. Towards Us is their return journey! Allah is the witness of everything they have done","10:47":"Each generation had its messenger. Once the message is delivered, the matter is decided justly. Nobody is dealt with unfairly","10:48":"They ask, \"If you are truthful, when will that promise come about","10:49":"Say, \"I do not have power to harm or benefit even myself, except what Allah wants. Each generation has an appointed time! When the time comes, it can neither be advanced nor delayed, even by a moment","10:50":"Say, \"The punishment might come any time during the night or the day. What do you think? What would the criminals accomplish by seeking to hasten it","10:51":"Are you planning to believe after it comes, and is already upon you?\" (They will be told), \"Now (you believe)! You had wanted to hasten it","10:52":"The evildoers would be told, \"Taste the eternal torment! Could your reward be any different from what your actions deserve","10:53":"They ask you to counsel them, \"Is it the absolute truth?\" Say, \"It is, I swear by my Lord! It is surely the truth! And you cannot prevent it","10:54":"Had each sinful soul owned everything in this world, it will be ready to offer the entire world as a ransom. As they see the torment, they will conceal their regret and remorse. Their matter will be decided and put to rest with justice. They shall not be treated unjustly","10:55":"Beware! Everything in the heavens and on the earth belongs to Allah! Be very sure! The promise of Allah is absolutely true! Yet most people do not know","10:56":"He gives life and He gives death, and to Him you shall all return","10:57":"Oh you people! An advice has come to you from your Lord. It is the remedy for (doubt,) that which lies within the heart. It is the guidance and mercy for all those who believe","10:58":"Say, \"They should be pleased with the mercy and the blessing of Allah. It is far better than what they amass","10:59":"Say, \"What about the provisions Allah has sent down for you? (On your own), you declare some (of them) to be unlawful, others lawful. Has Allah permitted you to do that? Or do you invent lies about Allah","10:60":"What do they _ those inventing lies about Allah _ think about the Day of Judgment? Allah is very generous to His servants, but most of them are ungrateful","10:61":"We personally observe all your affairs, whether you recite from the Qur´an, or are absorbed in any other activity! Not a single particle on earth, or in the heavens __ nor anything smaller or larger __ is ever out of your Lord´s attention. Everything is clearly spelled out in a clear record","10:62":"Beware! The friends of Allah shall have no fear; nor shall they ever grieve (or be sorry)","10:63":"Those who believe and guard against evil","10:64":"The glad tidings are for them in this world, and in the afterlife. The words of Allah are immutable! That, indeed, is a tremendous triumph","10:65":"Let their remarks not aggrieve you! Honor and power of all sorts belong to Allah! He hears all and knows all","10:66":"Beware! Everyone in the heavens and on the earth belongs to Allah! Those calling others besides Allah are not following any ´partners´ (of Allah). They merely run with their assumptions. They only indulge in conjectures","10:67":"He has made the night, so you may find rest; and He has made the day bright. Surely, in it are proofs for any nation willing to listen","10:68":"They say, \"Allah has taken a son!\" Exalted is He! He is free of all needs! Everything in the heavens and on the earth belongs to Him! Do you have an authority to say that? Or do you claim about Allah that, concerning which you have no knowledge","10:69":"Say, \"Liars, who invent falsehood about Allah, do not prosper","10:70":"Their possessions are but small provisions for this life only! Later, they must journey back to Us! Then, because of their disbelief, We shall have them taste a severe torment","10:71":"Recite the story of Nooh to them. He said to his people, \"Oh my people! Is my presence and my advice, based on the revelations of Allah, too harsh for you to bear? I place my trust in Allah. Get together with the partners (you ascribe to Allah) and decide your plan. Let neither grief nor anxiety hold you back! Go ahead, do your worst to me. Do not allow me a respite","10:72":"Should you turn away, remember! I did not ask any remuneration from you! My reward is only with Allah! I have been ordered to be obedient (to Him alone)","10:73":"They rejected him! So, aboard a ship, We rescued him, and those with him. We appointed them the successors, and We drowned those who rejected Our signs! Now, observe the fate of those who had been forewarned","10:74":"Then, after him We raised other messengers, who brought clear proofs to other people. (But) nothing changed their minds. They failed to accept that which they had rejected at the outset. Thus, We place a seal on the hearts of those guilty of excess","10:75":"Later, We raised Musa and Haroon, armed them with Our clear proofs and sent them to the Pharaoh and his chiefs. But, haughtily they rejected the proofs. They were indeed, a criminal nation","10:76":"When confronted with the proofs revealed by Us, they said, \"Surely, it is just witchcraft","10:77":"Musa responded, \"Is that how you treat the truth when it comes to you? You call it magic? The magicians, however, never thrive","10:78":"They said, \"We found our parents upon a particular way. Have you come to direct us away from the religion of our parents, so that your authority may prevail in the land? We are not going to believe the two of you","10:79":"The Pharaohs ordered, \"Have all the expert magicians summoned before me","10:80":"When the magicians arrived, Musa said to them, \"Cast your spells, if you would","10:81":"When they did, Musa said, \"Surely, what you have wrought is just magic! Allah will inactivate it! Allah does not correct the acts of the mischievous ones","10:82":"And with His words, Allah affirms the truth, much to the chagrin of the criminals","10:83":"Nobody, except a few of his people believed in Musa. (Nonetheless) they feared harassment by the Pharaoh and his people! In the land, the Pharaoh was overbearingly powerful; he was surely guilty of excess","10:84":"And Musa said, \"Oh my people! If you believe in Allah and are obedient, you must place your trust in Him","10:85":"They responded, \"In Allah do we trust! Oh our Lord, do not turn us into a test for the evil nation","10:86":"And by Your mercy, rescue us from the unbelieving nation","10:87":"We sent revelation to Musa and his brother ordering them to pick a house for their people in Egypt, to turn it into a Qibla (a place to face during prayers), and to establish the ´salat´. Give the glad tidings to the believers","10:88":"And Musa said, \"Our Lord, You surely have given the Pharaoh and his chiefs wealth and adornments in the life of this world. Our Lord, this so they lead people away from Your way. Our Lord! Efface their wealth and stiffen their hearts. Let them not believe, right until they witness the agonizing punishment","10:89":"(Allah) said, \"Your prayers have been accepted! Remain steadfast (you two)! And do not adopt the ways of those who do not know","10:90":"And We had the Israelites traverse the river. With hostile intentions, the Pharaoh followed with his armies; he sought revenge. When he became sure of drowning, he cried out, \"I now believe! There is no god except Allah, in whom the Israelites believe. I hereby submit! I am a Muslim","10:91":"Now you believe! You hadn´t before! And you were among the mischievous ones","10:92":"Today, We shall preserve your mortal remains, so you may become a lesson for your successors! Most people are really unmindful of Our signs","10:93":"We gave the Israelites really nice residences and granted them good provisions. Yet they began disputing after the knowledge had already come to them. On the Day of Judgment, your Lord will surely dispense His decision regarding everything they quarreled about","10:94":"Should you be in doubt about the revelation sent by Us, ask those before you, who are used to reciting the (divine) book. Indeed, the absolute truth from your Lord has come to you. Do not hesitate or entertain doubts","10:95":"And do not be among those who refuse to heed the signs of Allah, else you will be the loser","10:96":"There are those against whom the word of your Lord has come to pass. They will not believe","10:97":"Not even when confronted by all the signs! Not until they see the agonizing punishment by themselves","10:98":"Except the people of Yunus, no town benefited by their belief (after witnessing the punishment). We lifted the humiliating punishment from them in the life of this world; We had them enjoy the benefits for a while","10:99":"Had your Lord so wished, every soul upon this earth __ every single one of them __ would believe. Can you then, force people to believe","10:100":"No soul can believe except with Allah´s permission! And He hurls filth upon those who refuse to think and pay attention","10:101":"Say, \"Look at what lies in the heavens and on earth!\" All the signs and all the warnings fail to convince those who just would not believe","10:102":"Are they waiting for such hard times to afflict them as afflicted the earlier people? Tell them, \"Go ahead and wait! I, too, shall wait along with you","10:103":"Then, We rescued Our messengers and those who believed. Thus, it is mandatory for Us to rescue all believers","10:104":"Say, \"Oh you people! If you have doubts about my way, know it that I do not worship those whom you worship besides Allah. Rather, I worship Allah, the same One Who gives death to all of you! I am commanded to be a believer","10:105":"And to stand firm on faith, forsaking all else, and not to be amongst those who associate partners with Him","10:106":"Do not implore anyone other than Allah. No one (but Allah) can grant you any benefits, nor cause you any harm! Otherwise, you surely would be among the evil doers","10:107":"If Allah inflicts a distress upon you, no body can grant relief except He. If He wants to grant you a favor, no one can deflect His blessing away from you. He sends His mercy upon any of His servants He wants. And He is the most Forgiving and the most Kind","10:108":"Say, \"Oh you people! The truth has come to you. It is from your Lord! So, whoever accepts the guidance, does so for his own good. Whoever fails to do so, will only lead himself astray. I am not a guardian over you","10:109":"Keep following that which is revealed to you, and remain steadfast, right until Allah pronounces His verdict. He is absolutely the Best of the judges","11:1":"Alif, Laam, Raa. In the verses of this book (the Qur´an), orders have been revealed and then fully explained by the Wisest and the most Aware","11:2":"(Say),\"You must worship only Allah. Surely, I am a warner for you all, and a bearer of good news","11:3":"Seek forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him! He will have you enjoy excellent provisions till a specified time. (And in the life-to-come) He will grant a lot more to those who do plenty of good deeds. However, if you turn away (then remember) I am really worried for you about a torment on that great day","11:4":"Towards Allah is your return journey and He is capable of accomplishing all things","11:5":"Beware! In order to hide from Him they double their chest up, and wrap themselves up with clothes. Even then, He knows what they utter in secret, and what they declare openly. Surely, He even knows that which lies buried deep in their hearts","11:6":"The obligation to feed all living beings on the earth is upon Allah. He knows their resting places and their final depositories. Everything is inscribed in a clear book","11:7":"And it is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six periods of time _ His throne was over water _ in order to test you and to see which of you performs better deeds! In fact, when told that after death they will be raised (back to life), the unbelievers say, \"This is definitely magic","11:8":"When We postpone the punishment for a brief period, they taunt, \"What kept it?\" Beware! The day it (actually) lands on them, they will not be able to keep it away. That which they joke about, will engulf them","11:9":"When We deprive man of Our blessing after first having him taste it for a while, he turns blue, becomes ungrateful and loses all hope","11:10":"On the other hand when, after a period of hardship, We let him taste Our blessings, he says, \"The bad times are finally over\" and he starts to boast","11:11":"But those who are steadfast and do good deeds (do not boast); theirs shall be the forgiveness and a tremendous reward","11:12":"(Oh prophet)! Perhaps you would (feel inclined to) give up a part of the revelation. Perhaps your chest tightens up when they, (the unbelievers), taunt, \"Why was a treasure not sent down for him?\" and \"Why did an angel not accompany him?\" Actually, you are there only to warn, and Allah is responsible for all matters","11:13":"Do they claim that he has made it up himself? Say, \"If that is true, bring us ten such made up chapters, and call for help anyone you can, besides Allah","11:14":"Since they fail to respond, know for sure that this is being revealed to you by the knowledge of Allah, and that there is no god except He! Now, will you submit (lit: be Muslims)","11:15":"Those who prefer the life of this world and its décor will have their due in this life? We will reward their actions and deeds in full right here! They shall not be shortchanged","11:16":"Such people will have nothing in the life-to-come except hellfire. All their efforts in this life will be wasted. All their deeds are in vain","11:17":"Can there be any likeness between the unbelievers and those following the clear proof from their Lord (the Qur´an), recited to them by His witness. Prior to this, the book of Musa served as a guide, and was a blessing. Fire is the promised place of abode for whichever sect refuses to believe (the Qur´an). Hence do not be in two minds about it. Very definitely, it is the absolute truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe","11:18":"So, who can be more in error than the one inventing lies about Allah? They will be presented before their Lord. Witnesses will affirm that they were really the ones inventing lies about their Lord. Beware! Allah´s curse is upon the evil doers","11:19":"Those who dissuade others from the path of Allah and try to find fault with it, actually do not believe in the afterlife","11:20":"Such people will not be able to escape (Allah´s punishment) in the land. Besides Allah, they have no friends. Their torment shall be twice as severe. They carried on as if they were incapable of listening. They did not (try to) see","11:21":"They are the ones who placed themselves in a losing situation. The lies they had invented, eluded them","11:22":"No doubt at all! They will be the real losers in the life-to-come","11:23":"Those who believe, do good deeds and stand in humility before their Lord are the residents of paradise. There, they shall live forever","11:24":"The example of the two groups: one is blind and deaf while the other sees clearly and hears well. Can these two groups fare alike? So then, do you not think clearly","11:25":"We sent Nooh towards his people, and he said, \"I have come to you with a clear warning","11:26":"That you must not worship anyone other than Allah. For you I am afraid of a torment on a painful day","11:27":"The chiefs of the disbelieving nation said, \"We find you to be no more than a human like us, and we find that only those of lower status and immature opinion follow you. We do not find you superior to us in any way. In fact, we think you are a liar","11:28":"He said, \"Oh my people, do you not see? My Lord has blessed me with clear proofs by His grace, but you remain oblivious of it. What can we do to convince you, if you are full of hatred","11:29":"And, oh my people! I am not asking for any compensation in return. My reward, if any, is with Allah. I am not going to shun the believers. Indeed, they will meet their Lord! But I see that you are an irrational people","11:30":"And, oh my people, who will help me against Allah if I were to shun them! So, why don´t you heed","11:31":"I do not claim to have the treasures of Allah, or to be aware of the unknown, or to be an angel. I don´t agree with you that Allah will never award anything good to those you consider humble. Allah knows well what is in their hearts. I would be an evildoer if I shunned them","11:32":"They said, \"Oh Nooh, you have quarreled with us a lot! Enough of that now! If you are honest, go ahead and have that promise (punishment) wrought upon us","11:33":"(Nooh) said, \"Allah, if He wants, will inflict (the punishment) on you. You are really unable to prevent it","11:34":"Even though I advise you sincerely, my advice will not benefit you if Allah wants to lead you astray. He is your Lord and you would have to return to Him","11:35":"Do they say he has made it all up? Say, \"If I have made it up, I will face the blame. I, too, am absolved of the sins you commit","11:36":"Nooh received the revelation, \"Surely, now none of your people will believe, other than those who already have! Do not grieve over their deeds","11:37":"Build a boat under Our supervision and instructions. Do not talk to Me about the evil doers. For sure, they shall all drown","11:38":"He built a boat. The chiefs of his nation made fun of him each time they passed by. He said, \"Go ahead! Make fun of us. We, in our turn, will make fun of you like you make fun of us now","11:39":"You would soon find out, who will be humiliated by the approaching torment, and upon whom will the everlasting punishment land","11:40":"At last, when in response to Our orders the oven burst open, We said, \"Board on it a pair of each species (of animals), your family _ except those about whom the decision has already been made _ and the believers.\" Only a few had believed in him","11:41":"He said, \"Come aboard. It is going to sail and land in the name of Allah. My Lord is really very Forgiving and very Kind","11:42":"So the boat sailed with them amid waves as tall as mountains. Nooh spotted his son standing in an isolated place, and called out to him, \"My son, come aboard with us! And do not be an unbeliever","11:43":"(His son) said, \"I will climb over this hill and be saved. This hill will protect me from the floodwater.\" (Nooh) said, \"Today, according to the decree of Allah, there is no refuge except by His mercy.\" A wave shot up between the two and he was doomed to drown","11:44":"An order was handed down, \"Oh earth, gulp down your water, and oh sky, hold back.\" The command sounded, the water receded, the matter ended and the boat came to rest upon the hills of ´Jodee´. The announcement rang, \"The nation of evildoers has been flung aside","11:45":"Nooh called his Lord and said, \"Lord! Surely, my son is my family. Your promise is absolutely true and You are absolutely the Best of the judges","11:46":"(Allah) said, \"Oh Nooh! He is not your family. His deeds are evil! Heed My counsel and do not be like the ignorant ones. Do not implore Me for anything you have no knowledge of","11:47":"Said, \"Lord, I seek refuge with You! I begged You for something I knew nothing about. I will be a loser, if You do not have mercy on me. and forgive me","11:48":"He was told, \"Oh Nooh, disembark in peace. Our blessings are upon you and the group with you. Among their descendants, We will bestow benefits upon many groups. Later on, We will seize (those of) them (who are disobedient) and inflict upon them a painful torture","11:49":"We reveal to you these events of the (distant) unknown past. Neither you, nor your people had any knowledge of them. So endure patiently! Surely, the final outcome is for the pious","11:50":"And towards ´Aads´ We sent their brother, Hood. He said, \"Oh people, worship Allah (exclusively)! You do not have any other god besides Him! Your notions are just false","11:51":"Oh people, I do not ask you for any reward. My reward, if any, is with my Maker. Do you then not understand","11:52":"Oh people, seek your Lord´s forgiveness and turn towards Him. He will send plenty of rain for you, increase your strength and consolidate yourselves still further. Do not turn away and act like criminals","11:53":"They said, \"Oh Hood, you did not bring us any proof. We are not going to give up our gods merely because you say so. We are not going to believe you","11:54":"We would just say that you are ill. One of our gods has seized you with an affliction!\" Hood said, \"I call Allah as my witness, and all of you are my witnesses, too. I am sick and blameless of all the partners you (ascribe to Allah and) worship","11:55":"Other than Him! So get together, all of you! Grant me no respite! Do plan and play your tricks upon me","11:56":"I trust Allah completely, my Lord and your Lord. There isn´t an animal He does not hold captive, seizing it by the lock of its hair. Indeed, (the blessing of) My Lord is upon the straight path","11:57":"In case you turn away, remember that I have conveyed to you the message I was sent with. My Lord will cause another nation to take your place. You are not hurting Him a bit! My Lord keeps watch over each and every thing","11:58":"When Our punishment landed, We saved Hood by Our mercy, along with those who had believed him; We saved them from an excruciating punishment","11:59":"These people of ´Aad´! They rejected every proof of their Lord, the Cherisher, and defied His messengers. They followed the dictates of every obstinate tyrant","11:60":"So, the curse followed them in this life as well as on the Day of Judgment. Listen to this! ´Aads´ rejected their Lord! Listen good! ´Aads´, the nation of ´Hood´ were hurled aside","11:61":"Towards ´Samood´, We sent their brother Saleh. He said, \"Oh my people! Worship Allah! You do not have any other god besides Him. He brought you forth from dirt and settled you on the earth. So, seek forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance. My Lord is really close by, and He responds","11:62":"They said, \"Oh Saleh, before this you were one of us and we had such high hopes for you. Are you trying to keep us from worshipping the deities our forefathers worshipped? We are really in doubt about your message and we hesitate to listen to you","11:63":"He said, \"Oh my people, what would you suggest? I have clear proofs from my Lord and He has granted me His mercy. Now, shall I defy Him? In that case who would protect me from Allah? Your suggestions can only cause me a devastating loss","11:64":"Oh my people, this camel is a sign for you from Allah. Leave it alone and let it graze freely in Allah´s land. If you ever touch it with evil intentions, a calamity will befall you right away","11:65":"Yet, they slaughtered it. So he said, \"Enjoy your houses. You have three days! This is not a false promise","11:66":"And when Our punishment approached, We protected Saleh and those who believed in him. By Our Grace, We saved them from the disgrace of that day. Your Lord is indeed very Strong and Omnipotent","11:67":"A blast gripped the evildoers and flipped them flat out on their backs _ right in their homes _ in the morning","11:68":"It was as if they had never lived in their houses. Listen! The Samoods rejected their Lord! Listen good! Samoods were hurled aside","11:69":"And surely, Our messengers _ (Our angels) _ brought the glad tidings to Ibraheem. They said \"Peace\". He replied, \"Peace\" and rushed to serve them a roasted calf","11:70":"They did not stretch their hands towards the food. When he realized this, he was worried and felt frightened in his heart. They said, \"Do not be afraid, we have been sent to the nation of Loot","11:71":"His wife, standing there, let out a laughter. We gave her the good news of (a son) Ishaq and after Ishaq, Yaqub","11:72":"She said, \"Woe to me! Will I give birth? I am old and this husband of mine is old! This would really be an odd thing","11:73":"They said, \"Are you incredulous of the power and authority of your Lord? The mercy and the blessings of Allah are upon you, the residents of this house! He is worthy of all praise and He is really extremely Proficient","11:74":"After Ibraheem received the good news, and once the fear had left him, he began pleading with Us on behalf of the people of Loot","11:75":"Ibraheem was really very mild mannered, forbearing, and soft hearted","11:76":"Oh Ibraheem! Leave it! Let it be! Your Lord´s decree has arrived. An unavoidable torment will befall them","11:77":"And Our angels came to Loot. Their appearance bothered and distressed him a lot and he said, \"This is a terrible day","11:78":"The people of his tribe came rushing towards him. Before this, too, they used to commit despicable acts. He said, \"Oh my people! My daughters are here. They are holier and more befitting for you. Fear Allah and do not dishonor me before my guests! Isn´t there even a single rational person among you","11:79":"They said, \"Oh Loot, you have already learned that we have no interest in your daughters! You are well aware of what we desire","11:80":"He said, \"If only I had any power over you! If only I could turn to a formidable resource (against you)","11:81":"The (angels) said, \"Oh Loot! In reality, we are the angels of your Lord. These people will never get close to you! Gather your family during the night and slip away, except your wife. Whatever befalls others will strike her, too! Let no one turn around to watch the town. Dawn is their appointed time, and dawn is not far away","11:82":"And when Our decree landed, We turned them upside down and rained upon them stacks of stones made of baked clay, in quick succession","11:83":"These stones were marked by your Lord. The ruins (of the people of Loot) are not far away from the evildoers (living in your town)","11:84":"And towards ´Madyan´ (was sent) their brother, Shoaib. He said, \"Oh my people! Worship Allah! You have no other god besides Him! And do not decrease (cheat at) the measure or the scale. I see you wealthy, but I´m afraid you may be punished on that thorough day","11:85":"Oh my people! Employ the measure and the scales correctly! Do not shortchange people in their goods! And do not go about spreading mischief in the land","11:86":"Your savings from Allah´s grant are much better for you, if you only believe; and I am not appointed a guardian over you","11:87":"They said, \"Oh Shoaib, does your ´salat´ teach you that? Are you asking us to give up the deities our forefathers worshipped? Or that we should quit spending our wealth as we deem fit? Aren´t you the gentle and the rational one","11:88":"He said, \"Oh people! What if I really am upon a clear proof from my Lord, and what if He really has endowed me with a special gift? What would you say then? I do not want to commit that which I myself have advised you against. I want only to correct whatever I can! My good fortune (the ability to reform) is from Allah alone. Upon Him I trust and towards Him I turn","11:89":"And oh People! Do not ever let your antagonism towards me impair you, lest one of the calamities _ the likes of which struck the people of Nooh, the people of Hood and the people of Saleh _ strikes you, too. And the era of the people of Loot is not far removed from that of your own","11:90":"And seek forgiveness from your Lord, then turn towards Him in repentance. My Lord is really very Kind, and very Loving","11:91":"They said, \"Oh Shoaib! We do not understand much of what you say. However, we do find you weak among us. Had it not been for the family ties, we would have stoned you to death! You are not precious among us","11:92":"Said, \"Oh my people! Do you consider my family ties mightier than Allah? And have you turned your backs on Him? My Lord has definitely hemmed in around your actions from all sides (He is well aware of your actions)","11:93":"Oh my people, you stay on your course of action and I will carry out my task. Soon, you will discover who turns out to be the liar, and upon whom lands the degrading punishment. So wait, I too shall wait with you","11:94":"And when Our punishment arrived, We rescued Shoaib by Our mercy, and along with him the believers. A blast seized the evil doers. They were left dead, turned turtle in their homes","11:95":"As if, they had never lived there! Listen good! Just like the Samoods, the Madyanese, too, were tossed away","11:96":"And really, We sent Musa with Our signs and the clear proofs","11:97":"Towards the pharaoh and his chiefs! But they continued to obey the dictates of the pharaoh. And the commands of the pharaoh were not well guided","11:98":"On the Day of Judgment, he (the pharaoh) will lead his people; he will pilot them right into the hellfire, the worst quarters to have to enter","11:99":"A curse followed them in this life, and stayed with them on the Day of Judgment! Wretched is the gift they received","11:100":"We narrate to you these reports of some of the towns. Some of them are still standing, while others have long been mowed down","11:101":"We did not tyrannize them! In fact, they indulged themselves unjustly. The punishment of your Lord arrived, and the gods they implored besides Allah could not protect them a bit. Rather, they only helped to enhance their ruin","11:102":"Such is the severe punishment of your Lord when He seizes a town over its evil deeds. The capture by Him is very painful indeed","11:103":"In it, surely, is a sign for any one who fears the punishment of the afterlife. That is the day of congregation for all people, and that is the day of testimony for all souls","11:104":"We have only put it off for a brief period","11:105":"On the day that is sure to come, no soul will utter a word without His permission. Some amongst them would be mournful, others jubilant","11:106":"The mournful ones will be in fire, left there to moan and groan","11:107":"They shall reside in it till eternity, as long as the heavens and the earth exist, unless your Lord desires something else. Your Lord definitely gets to do what He intends","11:108":"And the jubilant ones will be in paradise! They will reside there till eternity _ an unceasing gift, as long as the heavens and the earth exist, unless your Lord desires something else","11:109":"So, do not entertain any doubt about the deities of these people. They are merely worshipping what their forefathers had worshipped before them, and We will provide them their share of the punishment _ without any curtailment","11:110":"Surely, We had awarded Musa the book; but they disputed it. Had the word from your Lord not already gone out, their dispute would have been settled. In fact, they remained in doubt and therefore, vacillated","11:111":"Definitely! Your Lord will fully compensate the deeds of all of them. He is really well Aware of all their deeds","11:112":"So, stay steadfast as commanded! You, along with those who have turned towards you! And do not overstep the bounds! He surely watches all your deeds","11:113":"Do not rely on the evil doers, or else the fire (of hell) will torment you. Then you will not be helped. You will not have any friends besides Allah, nor will you be helped","11:114":"And establish the ´Salat´ in the morning, the evening and during the night. The good deeds do, surely, nullify the bad ones! This is an exhortation for all those who are seeking advice","11:115":"And be patient! Surely, Allah does not waste the reward of the pious","11:116":"Why was it that the towns before you did not have people with wisdom _ except a few whom We rescued _ who could prevent the spread of mischief in the land? The evildoers persued the enjoyment of luxury and wealth. They were criminals","11:117":"Your Lord is not one to destroy a town unjustly so long as its residents are righteous","11:118":"Had your Lord wanted, He would have made all humans to be only one nation. They will always continue to dispute","11:119":"Except those upon whom your Lord has bestowed mercy. For this reason, He created them. The word of your Lord has come to pass, \"I shall definitely pack the hell with jinn and the humans, together","11:120":"We narrate to you all these stories of the past messengers in order to strengthen your heart. The absolute truth has come to you! It is an exhortation and the guidance for the believers","11:121":"And tell the unbelievers, \"Carry on in your place, while I shall continue my task","11:122":"Go ahead and wait! I, too, am waiting","11:123":"All the concealed mysteries of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah. All matters _ every single one of them _ are referred to Him. So, worship Him and rely on Him! Your Lord is not unaware of your deeds","12:1":"Alif, Laam, Ra; These are the verses of the clear lucid Book","12:2":"Surely, We have revealed this Qur´an in Arabic so that you may understand","12:3":"Through the revelations in this Qur´an, We narrate to you the best of the past events! You had no prior knowledge of these events","12:4":"Once, Yusuf said to his father, \"Oh my father! I had a dream. I saw eleven planets, the sun and the moon lying prostrate before me","12:5":"He said, \"Oh my son! Do not narrate your dream to your brothers! They might scheme and plot against you! Surely, Shaitan is the acknowledged foe of the human beings","12:6":"Your Lord will choose you. He will teach you to interpret dreams and events. Thus, He will confer His blessings upon you and the family of Yaqub. In the past, too, He had conferred His blessings upon Ibraheem and Ishaq, two of your great grandparents. Your Lord, really, is the all-Knowing and the all-Wise","12:7":"For the truth seekers, surely there is proof (of your prophethood) in the tale of Yusuf and his brothers. (They had demanded to hear the story of Yusuf)","12:8":"Yusuf´s half-brothers said, \"Our father loves Yusuf and his brother more than us, although we are a strong well-knit group! Our father is clearly misguided","12:9":"Let us kill Yusuf or cast him in a distant land. Our father´s attention will then be ours, exclusively! Later we will revert, and be pious","12:10":"One of them suggested, \"Let us not kill Yusuf! If you must do something, let us toss him in a dried out well. Let a passing caravan pick him up and take him","12:11":"They said, \"Oh father, Do you not trust us concerning Yusuf? Surely, we are his well-wishers","12:12":"Tomorrow, let him go with us! Let him play and enjoy! We will watch over him","12:13":"(The father) said, \"I am afraid you might take him out, then become unmindful of him and a wolf might devour him. That thought saddens me","12:14":"They said, \"A wolf will devour him? Despite the fact that we are such a strong knit group? We would be nothing but losers then","12:15":"They took him out and agreed amongst themselves to leave him in a dried out well. There, We sent word to Yusuf, \"Surely, one day you will describe to them this act of theirs, as they would fail to recognize you","12:16":"In the evening, they returned to their father, weeping","12:17":"They said, \"Oh father, we were engaged in a racing competition among ourselves. We had left Yusuf to watch over our baggage and a wolf got him and devoured him! You will not believe us even though we are telling the truth","12:18":"As evidence, they presented Yusuf´s shirt with fake blood on it. He said, \"Rather, your conscience has made the matter easier for you! I shall bear it with the utmost patience! I seek Allah´s support regarding what you say","12:19":"A passing caravan sent their water-carrier to fetch water. He lowered the pail and cried out, \"Good news! It´s a boy!\" They hid him in their baggage and Allah was well aware of their actions","12:20":"They soon got apprehensive about Yusuf, and sold him for a paltry sum ___ a few drachmas","12:21":"The one in Egypt who bought him, took him to his wife saying, \"Take good care of him! He might bring us some benefits or we might adopt him as a son!\" Thus, We provided a home for Yusuf in that land, so that We may teach him the interpretation of dreams and events. Allah has dominating controlis over His commands, but most people do not know","12:22":"When he came of age, We granted him wisdom and knowledge. This is how We reward those who are good","12:23":"Once, the lady of the house attempted to seduce him. She fastened the door and said, \"Come to me!\" He said, \"I seek Allah´s refuge! My master has treated me very well!\" Surely, the evil doers never prosper","12:24":"She advanced towards him; and he would have responded, had he not witnessed clear signs from his Lord! His Lord did that in order to keep him away from a lecherous and shameful act! He was among Our sincere servants","12:25":"He ran towards the door. She followed him, grabbed the back of his shirt and tore it. At the door they found her husband! She said, \"How do you punish the person who covets, and casts an evil (lustful) eye upon your wife? Shouldn´t he be put behind bars or receive other painful punishment","12:26":"He said, \"She was the one trying to seduce me!\" A witness from her family made an observation. He said, \"If the front of his shirt is torn, then she is right and he is the liar","12:27":"On the other hand, if the back of the shirt is torn, then he is right and she is lying","12:28":"He looked at the shirt. It was torn from the back! He said (to his woman), \"Surely, it was your treachery. The deception wrought by women is hard to figure","12:29":"Yusuf, ignore this! Oh woman, seek forgiveness! Surely, you are the wrong doer","12:30":"Gossip spread among the women of the town, \"The wife of the chief is infatuated with her slave and attempted to seduce him! We think she has clearly gone astray","12:31":"When she heard such sly remarks, she threw the ladies of the town a lavish party. During the party, she seated them on couches and gave each of them a knife. Then she asked Yusuf to suddenly appear before them. The ladies saw him and were stunned! Suddenly, (lost in amazement) they sliced their hands with the knife! They said, \"We swear by God! This could not be a man! He has to be an honored angel","12:32":"She said, \"This is the one you were taunting me about! I did try to seduce him, but he got away! Now, if he fails to comply with my wishes, he will definitely land in prison and will have to face humiliation","12:33":"Yusuf prayed, \"Oh Lord, They are inviting me towards the shameful act, but I prefer the life of prison over it. Please Lord! If You do not turn their wicked wiles away from me, I might succumb to them! If so, I would be among the ignorant wicked ones","12:34":"His Lord accepted his prayers and saved him from their evil plot. Surely, He is the One Who hears all and knows all","12:35":"Despite the evidence before them, they concluded that they better send Yusuf to prison for a while","12:36":"Two other young men had also landed in prison at about the same time. One of them said, \"I dreamt that I was extracting wine\". The other said, \"I saw myself carrying bread over my head and birds were eating out of that bread! Please, interpret our dreams for us! We find you to be so pious","12:37":"He said, \"I will tell you the interpretation of your dreams before it is time for you to be served dinner in prison! My Lord has taught this knowledge to me! I have abandoned this (evil) nation. They do not believe in Allah, and they deny the coming of the life-to-come","12:38":"I follow the ways of my forefathers: Ibraheem, Ishaq and Yaqub. It is not proper for us to associate any partners with Allah! Allah is Gracious to us and all other humans! But most people do not offer thanks","12:39":"Oh my companions of prison! Isn´t one God, Allah the Omnipotent, better than several independent gods","12:40":"What you worship besides Allah are merely names that you and your fore-fathers have made up! Allah has not sent down any sanction for it! Allah, alone, has the authority! He has commanded that you do not worship anyone else besides Him! This is the established permanent way! But most people do not know","12:41":"Oh my comrades in prison! One of you will serve wine to his master. The other will be crucified; birds will peck the meat from his head! The matter, about which you sought my opinion has been clarified","12:42":"Yusuf said to the one he thought will survive, \"Tell your master about me!\" But Shaitan made him forget and Yusuf stayed in prison for a few additional years","12:43":"The king said, \"I had a dream! I saw seven lean cows devouring seven fat ones and I saw seven green ears of corn and seven other dry ones! Oh my Courtiers, tell me the meaning of my dream, if you have any experience in dream interpretation","12:44":"They said, \"Dreams are nothing but scattered meaningless thoughts. We are not aware of any meaning in the dreams","12:45":"After a while, Yusuf´s companion in prison __ the one who had survived __ remembered him and said, \"I will tell you its meaning. First, send me on a trip (to the prison)","12:46":"Oh Yusuf, the truthful, give me your opinion about this dream. Seven lean cows ate seven fat ones! And there were seven green ears of corn and seven dry ones! Hopefully, I can return to my people and inform them about the meaning of that dream","12:47":"(Yusuf) said, \"You will reap bumper crops for seven years. So leave the grain you harvest in its ear. Store it, except for what you need to eat","12:48":"These will be followed by seven years of drought. During that time, you will use up all the grain you had stored, except what you need as seed","12:49":"This will be followed by a year of pouring rain. People will press grapes to get wine","12:50":"The king said, \"Bring him to me!\" The king´s messenger came to fetch him! (Yusuf) said, \"Go back to your master and ask him, \"What about the ladies who had sliced their hands. My Lord, of course, is very well Aware of their treacherous deception","12:51":"The king said, \"Ladies! What about it? Did you really try to seduce him?\" The women said, \"We swear by Allah, we did not find anything evil in him!\" The chief´s woman said, \"It has all come out now! The truth is, it was I who tried to seduce him! He is surely telling the truth","12:52":"(Yusuf said), \"Just so the truth comes out! I did not betray my master´s trust in his absence. Surely, Allah does not guide the disloyal and the faithless","12:53":"I am not trying to pretend piety. The self in fact does instigate and nudge towards evil! (Its incitements are not easy to resist), except for those upon whom my Lord showers His mercy. My Lord is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","12:54":"The king said, \"Bring him to me. I will keep him specifically for myself!\" and after conversing with him declared, \"Surely today, as far as I am concerned, you are trustworthy","12:55":"(Yusuf) said, \"Appoint me the chief of the earth´s treasury. I have the knowledge and I am the protector","12:56":"Thus, We granted Yusuf power and authority in the land. He could live anywhere he wanted! By Our Grace, We guide whom We please. We do not waste the rewards of the pious","12:57":"And the reward of the afterlife is, indeed, better! It is for those who believe and are fearful (pious)","12:58":"Yusuf´s brothers came to Egypt, and visited him (to receive their share of the grain); he recognized them but they could not recognize him","12:59":"He prepared their baggage (with their share of grain) and said, \"Next time, make sure you bring your half brother to me. Do you not notice, I fill the measure to the full, and I am a good host","12:60":"You may not receive any grain, nor even come close (to me) unless you bring him along","12:61":"They said, \"We will surely try to induce his father (to send him along). That, of course, we will do","12:62":"Yusuf asked his aides to put their barter goods back into their baggage, so that they may recognize their goods upon returning to their families. Then maybe they will return to Egypt","12:63":"They returned to their father and said, \"We have been refused our next share of grain. Please send our brother with us, so that we may obtain our due portion. We will surely watch over him","12:64":"(Their father) said, \"Shall I trust you with him now, like I trusted you with his brother earlier? Allah is the real Protector. He is absolutely the most Merciful","12:65":"They unpacked their baggage and found their barter goods returned to them. They said, \"Oh our father! What else do we need! These are our goods (with which we paid for the grain) returned to us! Now, we can provide for our family! We will watch over our half-brother and increase our share by a camel load of grain. This load of camel is really easy for us","12:66":"(The father) said, \"I will not send him along, unless you give me your solemn word _ sworn in the name of Allah as your witness _ that you will bring him back to me, unless you are ambushed. When they gave him a firm assurance, he said, \"Allah is the witness over what you say","12:67":"And he said, \"Oh my sons! Don´t you all enter the town through one gate, but rather go through different ones. I cannot protect you a bit against Allah. The authority belongs solely to Allah! I trust Him! All trusting persons should place their trust in Him","12:68":"They went into town passing through different gates, as instructed by their father. That could not have protected them against Allah a bit, but this is how Yaqub felt in his heart. So he chose to satisfy himself. He had the knowledge given by Us, but most people do not know","12:69":"They came to Yusuf. He pulled his brother close to him and said, \"I am your brother. Do not grieve over what they have done","12:70":"Then, as he packed their luggage for departure, he hid the peg in his brother´s baggage. (When the caravan departed), the announcer called, \"Oh you people of the caravan! You are thieves","12:71":"They came forward and asked, \"What have you lost","12:72":"The king´s peg is missing!\" they said, \"A reward of a camel load of grain has been announced (for its recovery). We are the guarantors of that peg","12:73":"They said, \"By Allah, you know us. We have not come to make trouble in the land! We are not thieves","12:74":"He said, \"So what should be the punishment of the thief, if you are lying","12:75":"They said, \"He, in whose baggage the stolen goods is found, should be arrested and kept along with the goods. That is how we punish the transgressors","12:76":"First, he searched the baggage of others. Then came to his brother and produced it (peg) from his baggage! Thus, We played a trick on them, and found an excuse for Yusuf. The law of the king did not allow Yusuf to keep his brother! We elevate in status, whomever We please! And over all those with knowledge, there is the One Who is the all-Knowing","12:77":"They said, \"He is not alone! His brother, too, had committed a theft earlier.\" Yusuf swallowed that remark and disclosed nothing. In his heart, he said, \"You are indeed, of an evil status! And Allah knows what you describe","12:78":"They said, \"Oh chief, his father is really very old. Keep one of us in his stead! We find you to be a kind hearted person","12:79":"Said, \"May Allah help us! We can only keep the one, in whose baggage we found the stolen goods. We may not keep any one else! Otherwise, we will be the transgressors","12:80":"They failed to convince Yusuf, and consulted each other. The oldest brother said (to others), \"Do you not know? Father had obtained a firm oath upon Allah from you. And earlier, in Yusuf´s case, you had been neglectful. I will not leave this place until my father permits me, or until Allah decides my fate. He is the Best of the judges","12:81":"Go back to your father and tell him, \"Oh father, your son committed a theft. We say only what we know, and we could not have foreseen the future! We could not protect him from the unseen","12:82":"Ask the people of the town we were in, or others in our caravan. We are telling the truth","12:83":"(The father) said, \"Rather, your evil spirits made it easier for you (to say that)! I will bear with patience, the utmost patience! Allah might still bring both of my sons back to me. Surely, He is the All-knower and the All-wise","12:84":"He turned away from them and said, \"Alas! Poor Yusuf!\" He tried to hide his feelings, but his eyes turned white with grief","12:85":"They said, \"By Allah, you would never quit talking about Yusuf, until you either die or melt away","12:86":"Said, \"I complain only to Allah about my grief and anxiety. I know that about Allah, which you do not know","12:87":"Oh my sons! Go look for Yusuf and his brother. Do not give up hope. Have faith in the mercy of Allah. Surely, only the disbelievers lose hope in the mercy of Allah","12:88":"When they visited Yusuf again, they said, \"Oh Chief, we and our families have come upon some hard times. We have brought our humble assets. Please be charitable and let us have the full measure of grain. Allah, surely, rewards those who are charitable","12:89":"He said, \"Now do you realize what you had done to Yusuf and his brother in your ignorance, earlier","12:90":"They asked, \"Are you really Yusuf?\" Said, \"I am. And this is my brother! Allah has bestowed favors upon us. Surely, Allah does not waste the reward of the pious, those who fear Him and remain steadfast","12:91":"They remarked, \"We swear by Allah! He chose you over us. We were clearly the wrong-doers","12:92":"(Yusuf) said, \"There is no censure, today. Allah will forgive you. And He is absolutely the most Forgiving of all","12:93":"Take this shirt of mine and place it over my father´s eyes! It will bring back his sight! And bring all your families to me","12:94":"And when the caravan moved (from Egypt) their father said, \"Call me senile, but I am beginning to smell the scent of Yusuf","12:95":"They said, \"By Allah, you are still obsessed by that same old thing","12:96":"The bearer of good news arrived and placed the shirt over his face. His sight was restored forthwith. Said, \"Did I not tell you? I know that about Allah, which you do not know","12:97":"They said, \"Oh our father, pray for our forgiveness. We surely, are the sinners","12:98":"Said, \"I will ask my Lord to forgive you. He is really the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","12:99":"When they came to Yusuf, he raised his parents to the throne with him, saying, \"Welcome to Egypt, God willing, in peace","12:100":"He helped his parents up to the throne with him; and they all fell down prostrate before him! He said, \"Oh Father! This is what I saw in my dream earlier. My Lord has made it all come true. He blessed me, when He took me out of prison, and again when He brought all of you to me from the village, even though Shaitan had sowed discord between me and my brothers. Surely, my Lord is extremely kind to whomever He pleases, and surely, He is the All-knower and the Wise","12:101":"My Lord! You have awarded me kingdom and have taught me the meaning of (dreams and) events. Oh Maker of the heavens and the earth, You are our Patron in this world, as well as in the afterlife. Give me the death of a Muslim, and let me join the pious","12:102":"These are the events of the unseen distant past which We reveal to you (oh Mohammed)!. Certainly, you were not present among them, when they were in accord and were plotting and scheming","12:103":"Most people will not believe, no matter how hard you try","12:104":"Do you ask them for anything in return? This (Qur´an) is, in fact, a reminder and an advice for the entire world","12:105":"There are so many signs in the heavens and the earth. They pass by them without paying any attention","12:106":"Most of them do believe in Allah, but then they associate partners with Him","12:107":"Do they now feel secure from the overwhelming punishment of Allah, or the hour (of Judgment). It may descend upon them suddenly, when they least expect it","12:108":"Say, \"This is my way. It is with proofs and evidences! I, as well as those who follow me, call you towards Allah. He is the most High! I would never commit the sin of shirk (associating partners with Allah)","12:109":"Even prior to you, We sent men from among the townsfolk towards them. To these men, We sent revelations. Have they not moved about in the land and seen the fateful end of those before them? The abode of the afterlife is far superior, and it is for those who are fearful (pious)! So, do they not think","12:110":"Take heart! Our help arrived just as the messengers were beginning to lose hope and (their opponent) thought that they had been lied to (by the messengers)! We rescued whom We pleased! Our punishment will never be warded off from the criminal nation","12:111":"Surely, for those who are wise there is a moral in this tale. It is not a made-up story! The book that exists with them confirms it in all its details. And in it is guidance and mercy for any nation that believes","13:1":"Alif, Laam, Meem, Ra. These verses of the book are the absolute truth revealed to you by your Lord. But most people do not believe","13:2":"It is Allah Who raised the heavens without any pillars, as you can see. Then, He mounted the throne and tamed the sun and the moon _ each is in motion for a specified time. He conducts His affairs and He explains His signs. Perhaps you will acknowledge the scheduled meeting with your Lord","13:3":"He spread out the earth, and laid upon it mountains and rivers. He made fruits of all kinds in pairs, and He wrapped the day over the night. Surely, these are all signs for a pondering nation","13:4":"There are adjoining tracts of lands on earth containing fields, date-trees _ some with forked trunks _ and grape orchards. The same water irrigates them all. Yet, We excelled some over others in taste and nutrition. That surely is a sign for a thinking nation","13:5":"Be amazed if you must, at their question, \"After we have become dust, would we be created anew?\" They are the ones who have rejected their Lord! They have shackles round their necks and they are the inmates of (hell) fire! They shall live in it for ever","13:6":"They hasten to seek the bad before the good. The likes of them have gone by earlier. Indeed, your Lord forgives people despite their sins! Indeed, your Lord is very Stern when He punishes","13:7":"The unbelievers say, \"Why did a sign from his Lord not accompany him?\" You are truly a warner for them! There is always a guide for every generation","13:8":"Allah is Aware of every pregnant female, that which she carries, and that which her uterus draws off and supplies. He has all things in perfect proportions","13:9":"He knows all things, manifest as well as mysterious and unseen. He is the Mightiest and the most High","13:10":"It is the same for Him whether you whisper or shout out loud, hide in the dead of night or walk in broad daylight","13:11":"By the orders of Allah, the guardian angels accord protection. They keep watch in front of and behind everyone. Surely, Allah does not alter the fate of a nation till they change their own selves. If Allah intends evil for a people, there is no escape from it. They have no guardian besides Allah","13:12":"It is He Who shows you the lightning, and you observe it with fear and anticipation. He initiates the clouds heavy with rain","13:13":"Out of fear, the angels sing His praises, and so does thunder. With a bolt of lightning, He stupefies whomever He wants. Yet, they quarrel about Allah! He is extremely Powerful","13:14":"To call (and implore) Him is the real prayer. _ (To be prayed to, is His exclusive right). Those others they implore besides Him could never respond! They are like the one stretching his hands towards water, wishing it to enter his mouth. It never can! The prayers of the unbelievers will only go to waste","13:15":"Everything in the heavens and on earth falls prostrate before Allah _ willing or not! So do all shadows, every morning and evening","13:16":"Ask them, \"Who sustains the heavens and the earth?\" Say, \"Allah!\" Say, \"Do your patrons _ those you accept besides Him _ have any ability to benefit or harm even their own selves?\" Say, \"Is a blind man comparable to the one with eyes? Are darkness and daylight equal? Have others, like the partners you ascribe to Allah, created anything that matches His creations? Is that the doubt?\" Say, \"Allah alone is the Creator of all things! He is the One and Only, and He is the Omnipotent","13:17":"The rainwater He sends down fills the drains to their capacity. The rushing water carries the froth on top. When purified over fire, the jewelry and other fineries also yield froth. Allah illustrates the truth and falsehood with these examples! The froth gets discarded, while that which is useful stays behind to serve the earth! In this manner Allah cites the parables","13:18":"The happy ending is for those who respond to their Lord! Those who do not, would be ready to pay as ransom the entire wealth of this world, and even twice as much if it was theirs! Their reckoning will be stringent, and hell would be their home _ a horrendous place","13:19":"So! Can those accepting the absolute truth revealed to you by your Lord be like the blind? Surely only the rational ones pay heed","13:20":"Those who fulfill their pledge with Allah and do not break their covenant","13:21":"Those who establish that which Allah has enjoined, fear Allah and are afraid of the stringent reckoning","13:22":"Those who remain steadfast, seek the pleasure of their Lord, establish ´salat´ and out of Our grant give charity _ openly as well as in secret. The eventual success is theirs! They get rid of their sins by their righteous deeds","13:23":"They will enter the eternal paradise, and so will the righteous among their forefathers, children and wives. Angels will come to serve them from every door","13:24":"(Angels will say) ´Peace upon you´, in return for your patience. The final outcome, par excellance, is yours","13:25":"Cursed are those who enter into a pact, and then violate their pledges, those spreading mischief in the land, and those severing the relationship Allah has enjoined. Theirs is the worst abode","13:26":"Allah extends or limits the provisions, for whomever He pleases. They are contented with the life of this world. Compared to the afterlife, this life is just a brief comfort","13:27":"The unbelievers say, \"Why did his Lord not send down a sign with him?\" Say, \"Allah leads astray whomever He wants, and He guides those who heed","13:28":"The believers find solace in the remembrance of Allah. Listen good! Hearts obtain solace with the remembrance of Allah","13:29":"The title of honor and an exquisite abode belong to those who believe and do righteous acts","13:30":"Generations before them have passed like that. To this generation We sent you! So you may recite Our revelations to them. They have disavowed the most Merciful! Say, \"He is my Lord. There is no god except Him! In Him do I trust! And towards Him is my return","13:31":"What if the mountains move about, the earth rips open and the dead begin talking? What if the Quran were to cause all that? (They would still not believe). Indeed, the power and prerogative of all sorts belong to Allah! Do the believers not feel reassured by the fact that Allah, if He had wanted, could bestow guidance upon all people. As a consequence of their lies, calamity would continue to hit them in their homes, or strike nearby, till the day of His promise. Surely, Allah does not renege on His promise","13:32":"Many messengers were mocked prior to you. I allowed the unbelievers some respite; then I seized them. How terrible was My punishment","13:33":"They appoint partners for Allah, even though He is the vigilant Guardian over every soul´s deeds! Say, \"Name them! Are you just blurting things out or do you, on His earth, know something that even Allah does not? The deceptions of the disbelievers are made to appear delightful for them. Such deceptions keep them away from the straight path! No body can guide those whom Allah leads astray","13:34":"They will be punished in the life of this world; and the torture of the afterlife is more severe! They have no helpers against Allah´s wrath","13:35":"The paradise being promised to the righteous has rivers flowing right through it. Its food and shades are eternal! Such is the reward for the righteous, and the retribution for the unbelievers is fire","13:36":"The people of the book are pleased about what is revealed to you. However, groups of them dispute portions of it. Say, \"My orders are to worship Allah exclusively, and not join partners with Him. Towards Him I call you, and towards Him is my return journey","13:37":"Thus, We have sent down this order in Arabic. After this revelation, if you allow any adjustment for their whims, you will find no rescuers or protectors against Allah","13:38":"Indeed, prior to you We sent messengers who also had wives and children. No messenger can perform miracles of his own accord _ without the will of Allah. Each age has its own preordained destiny","13:39":"Allah abolishes, and confirms, what He wants! He has the real authority","13:40":"You (oh Mohammed, SAW) may witness how We punish them, or We may let you die first. Either way, conveying the message is your obligation, calling them to account is Ours","13:41":"Have they not observed? We are consistently shrinking the land from all sides. Allah´s is the final command. There is no overseer above Him and His reckoning is swift","13:42":"The nations before them tried to be cunning. Ingenuity of all sorts belongs to Allah! He knows exactly the deed each soul has gathered. The unbelievers will soon realize who triumphs in the final outcome","13:43":"The unbelievers are saying, \"You are not the messenger.\" Tell them, \"The testimony of Allah, or anybody with the knowledge of the book, is enough to settle this issue between you and me","14:1":"Alif, Laam, Ra. We revealed to you this book, so that by the will of Allah, you may lead people out of darkness into light, towards the path of the most Powerful and the Praiseworthy","14:2":"To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and on earth, and for the unbelievers, there is an affliction of the worst severity","14:3":"Those who love the life of this world more than that of the life-to-come, place obstacles in the path of Allah. They look for twists to deviate from it. They have strayed far away from the path","14:4":"We have always sent messengers who were proficient in the language of their people, so they could explain the matter clearly. Allah guides or leads astray whomever He pleases. He is the most Powerful, the Wisest","14:5":"We surely sent Musa with Our signs, commanding, \"Lead your people out of darkness, and into light. Remind them of the blessings of Allah. Surely, in it are alerting signs for the grateful and the steadfast","14:6":"And Musa said to his people, \"Do you recall the blessings of Allah? He liberated you from the tortures of the pharaohs. They inflicted horrid suffering upon you when they slaughtered your sons and let your womenfolk live! That was, indeed, a gruesome trial from your Mighty Lord","14:7":"And your Lord proclaimed, \"If you are grateful, I will grant you much more. Should you be ungrateful, My retribution is very severe, indeed","14:8":"And Musa said, \"What if you express ingratitude, you and everyone else in the world together? Even then, Allah is Free of all wants; He is Praise-worthy","14:9":"Have you not heard the tales of those gone by __ the people of Nooh, Aads, Samoods, and others after them? Now, no one knows them except Allah. The messengers brought them clear proofs! But they shoved their hands in the messengers´ mouths, _ (forbade them to speak) _ and said, \"Here! We reject what you were sent with. We are reluctant and skeptical about your message","14:10":"The messengers replied, \"Do you have misgivings about Allah, Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He offers to forgive your sins and to grant you an extension for a prescribed period.\" They said, \"You are only humans like us, and you intend to turn us away from the deities our parents worshipped. Bring us a convincing miracle first","14:11":"The messengers said to them \"Of course, we are humans like you! But Allah confers His blessings upon such of His servants as He chooses! Without the will of Allah, we cannot bring you any miracles! The believers should bestow their trust in Allah","14:12":"And why must we not place our trust in Allah, when He has already shown us our paths? With patience, we shall bear any suffering You inflict upon us. In Allah alone, must the believers bestow their trust","14:13":"The unbelievers said to the messengers, \"We would certainly drive you out of the land, unless you return to the folds of our religion.\" Their Lord disclosed to them (the messengers), \"We will, surely wipe out the evildoers","14:14":"In their place, We will settle you in the land. This is for those who fear Our reckoning and heed Our warning","14:15":"They sought the decision, and every obstinate oppressor lost out","14:16":"Hell lies in wait for such ones! There, to drink he shall have pus-filled discharge from wounds","14:17":"With difficulty he will sip it, and with trouble he will manage to swallow it down. Death shall accost him from all sides, but die he shall not! Yet another tough torment shall lie in wait for him","14:18":"Those, who reject their Lord, shall not benefit from any of their deeds. Their deeds are like ashes, being blown away by strong winds on a stormy day. Theirs is the blunder of the worst kind","14:19":"Do they not see that Allah created the heavens and the earth with perfection? If He wants, He can make you extinct and replace you with a different creation","14:20":"That is not at all difficult for Allah","14:21":"When all of them together appear before Allah, the weak among them shall say to those who had been considered great, \"We used to follow you! So, now can you offer any protection against Allah´s wrath at all.\" They shall reply, \"Had Allah guided us, we would have guided you. It is the same for us now, whether we worry or stay calm. There is no escape for us, now","14:22":"Once it is all over (on the judgment day), Shaitan will say, \"Allah gave you a pledge. His promise was real and came true. I too pledged, but I deserted and failed you! I had no hold over you. I merely proposed and you accepted. So, now, condemn yourself and not me. I cannot respond to your screams for help, nor can you heed my cry for aid. I deny your act of associating me with Allah.\" For the evildoers, there is a painful punishment","14:23":"And those who believe and do good deeds would be ushered into paradise. Rivers run right through it. Their Lord willing, they would live in it forever! In it, they would be greeted with salutes of ´peace´","14:24":"Do you not see how Allah strikes the parable of the ´kalima tayyaba´ (the noble words)? It resembles the healthy tree, with roots firmly planted and branches reaching the sky","14:25":"By the Lord´s will, it bears fruit all the time! Allah quotes this example, so that people may understand","14:26":"And the parable of the evil words is like a repulsive diseased tree. It is uprooted from the land and has no stability","14:27":"With this firm statement, Allah strengthens the believers in this world and in the afterlife. He leads the transgressors astray. Allah does what He wills","14:28":"Did you not see those who treated the blessings of Allah with ingratitude and landed their people in the house of ruin","14:29":"The hell, which they will enter, is the worst dwelling","14:30":"They invent partners for Allah, in order to throw others off the course. Say, \"Enjoy yourself! For surely, you will proceed forth right into the fire","14:31":"Convey My instructions to those of My servants who believe, that they should establish ´salat´ and give charity __ openly and in secret __ out of what We have granted them, before the day arrives when neither trade nor friendship will avail","14:32":"Allah is the Creator of the heavens and the earth. He sends rain from the sky. With that water, He brings out the produce for you to eat. He ordered the ships to submit to you! With His commands, they sail across the seas! He also tamed the rivers for you","14:33":"And for you, He tamed the sun and the moon; they are forever on course. He subjected the night and the day to benefit you","14:34":"He granted you whatever you asked for. His blessings upon you are so numerous, they are incalculable! Man, indeed, is ungrateful and unjust","14:35":"And Ibraheem said, \"My Lord, make this town (Makkah) peaceful and secure, and steer me and my progeny away from idol-worship","14:36":"My lord, these idols have driven a lot of people astray. Surely, whoever obeys me is my follower. However, if anyone disobeys me, then indeed, You are the most Kind and the most Forgiving","14:37":"Oh our Lord! Surely, I have settled my family close to Your sanctified house, in a barren valley devoid of all cultivation, in order that they establish ´salat´. Oh our Lord, make their hearts lean towards it, and provide them Your bounties so they may express their gratitude","14:38":"Surely, our Lord, You are aware of what we conceal as well as what we declare! And nothing is ever hidden _ whether in the heavens or on earth _ from Allah","14:39":"All praise is for Allah, Who gave me (two sons) Ismail and Ishaq, despite my old age. Surely, my Lord hears the supplication","14:40":"Oh my Lord, make me and my family firm on ´salat´, and oh my Lord, accept my prayers","14:41":"Oh my Lord! Forgive me, my parents and all believers on the day the final accounting will be held","14:42":"Do not even pause to consider that Allah could be unmindful of what the evil ones are doing. He only postpones their fate till the day when their eyes will be glazed and fixed","14:43":"Holding their heads high, running scared, _ their eyes popping out of their sockets _ they will be frightened out of their wits","14:44":"And (Oh Mohammed, SAW) alert the people about that day when the punishment will land on them. At that time, the evildoers will say, \"Oh our Lord, allow us just a little more time! We promise to heed Your call and obey the messengers.\" ... (what)? ... \"You used to swear, did you not, that you will never have to contend with any adversity","14:45":"You inhabit the locality of those people (of the previous age) who had harmed their own selves. It should be amply clear to you how We dealt with them. We have cited you their examples","14:46":"They played their tricks! But Allah had an answer to all their tricks. Their tricks were so effective. Mountains could vanish by their tricks","14:47":"Do not even doubt that Allah can ever breach His promise with the messengers. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Power, the Lord of Revenge","14:48":"That day, the earth will be transformed into something altogether different. So will the heavens. And every one will appear before Allah, the Conqueror, and the only One","14:49":"That day, you will see the criminals, bound up in shackles and chains","14:50":"Their shirts will consist of molten tar, and fire will wrap their faces","14:51":"So that Allah may duly compensate each soul! And Allah is very swift in calling to accounts","14:52":"This is the message for the people, so that they may come to know.

They will soon come to know","15:4":"We never destroy any locality except in accordance with a preordained scheme and time-plan","15:5":"No generation shall hasten or delay the term fixed for it","15:6":"They (the unbelievers) said, \"Oh you, upon whom this reminder is revealed! You are really insane","15:7":"Wouldn´t you have come to us with angels, had you been truthful","15:8":"We dispatch the angels only with the final judgment. In that case, they would have no respite","15:9":"Indeed it is We Who revealed this Qur´an, and of course We are its guardian","15:10":"Indeed, prior to you too, We sent (messengers) __ even to ancient tribes","15:11":"They mocked every messenger that ever came to them","15:12":"Thus We let this (mockery) pass through the hearts of the criminals","15:13":"They do not believe! This has been the tradition of their ancestors","15:14":"Even if We were to fling open a door in the sky, and they were actually climbing up through it","15:15":"They would say, \"Our sights fail us, we are drugged.

Beware! Very heavy, indeed, is the burden they carry","16:26":"Before them, too, people tried deception and trickery. Allah finished off their edifice from its very foundation.

That is how Allah rewards the pious","16:32":"The angels will take possession of their souls in a state of purity and will say to them, \"Peace upon you! Enter the paradise as a reward for what you used to do","16:33":"Are they (evildoers) waiting for the angels to visit them? Or for Allah´s decree to come crashing down on them? Other folks before them did just that! Allah did not victimize them wrongfully. Rather, they used to treat their own selves unjustly","16:34":"The evil of their own deeds struck them down. Their acts of ridiculing and mocking (the truth) engulfed them","16:35":"Those guilty of ´shirk´ (ascribing partners to Allah) said, \"Unless Allah had so willed, we would not worship anyone else besides Him. Nor would our ancestors. We could not have sanctified anything else other than Him.\" Those others before them said that too! Is there any (obligation) upon the messengers, except to convey the message distinctly","16:36":"Surely We raised into every people, messengers who exhorted them to worship Allah and to avoid false gods. Among the people were those whom Allah guided, while waywardness became the lot of others. Move about in the land and observe the demise of those who denied","16:37":"You may desire guidance for them, but Allah does not show the way to anyone He has already led astray. They have no allies","16:38":"They swear by Allah a lot, claiming emphatically that Allah will not bring the dead back to life.

They cannot thwart (Allah´s designs)","16:47":"Or seize them first with terror, then grab them as they dread? Yet, your Lord is most Forgiving and most Beneficent, indeed","16:48":"Do they not observe all the things Allah has created?

He is the Powerful, the Wisest","16:61":"If Allah were to punish people for (all) their evil deeds (in this life), no one would be left with any life (on this planet). But, for a determined time, He has postponed the final judgment. Once that time comes, no stay shall be allowed __ not even for an hour","16:62":"To Allah they assign that which they despise for themselves. They utter lies, that theirs would be all the good things. No doubt at all! Fire is for them, and they will enter it ahead of all others","16:63":"By Allah, surely, We also sent messengers to the nations before you (Oh Mohammed, SAW). Shaitan, however, made their deeds appear adorable to them. Today too, he is their friend and theirs is the painful punishment","16:64":"We revealed this Book to you so that you may resolve their disputes. (It is) a guidance and mercy for any nation that believes","16:65":"Allah sends rain down from the sky. With that (water), He brings the dead barren land back to life.

Extracts of varying colors, having medicinal properties for people, ooze out from its body. Surely, there is a sign in it for any nation that ponders","16:70":"Allah created you and He will give you death. Some of you live to a feeble old age, so that once again you forget those few things you learn in life! Surely, Allah is the Knower and really Proficient","16:71":"And Allah has excelled some of you over others in wealth. Those given preferences do not hand over their riches to their slaves, letting their slaves rise to a status equal to theirs. Yet they fail to acknowledge the blessings of Allah","16:72":"And Allah provided you spouses from your own kind, and through them He granted you children and grand children. He gave you good clean means of living!

Nor do they have any such power","16:74":"Therefore, do not try to teach Allah! Surely, Allah knows it (all), while you know nothing (at all)","16:75":"Allah quotes the example of a bonded slave who does not own a thing. To another, We have granted enough riches, and he spends his wealth, openly and in secret. Can the two be equal? (Of course not)! All praise is for Allah! But most people do not know","16:76":"Allah quotes another example, that of the two men. One is deaf and dumb, has no ability and is nothing but a liability for his master. He fails every task he is asked to perform. Can he be compared to the man who manages his affairs with fairness, and is on the straight path","16:77":"The mysteries of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah, and the hour (of Judgment) will come about in a blink of an eye, even less than that.

You find it light as you pitch it to stay, and as you pack it to travel. From the wool, fur and the hair of cattle, He brought about furnishings and other benefits for you __ all for a while","16:81":"Allah brought about shelters and protection for you out of what He created. He provides you refuge in the mountains (caves), the garments to shield you from heat, and the shirts to shield you from injury (during combat). Thus, He made His blessings complete upon you! Perhaps, you would bow in obedience","16:82":"Of course, in case they ignore and turn away, your obligation is to convey the message in clear and precise terms","16:83":"They recognize the blessings of Allah, and yet renounce them!

Nor shall they have a respite","16:86":"Those guilty of ascribing partners to Allah, will spot those partners (on the Day of Judgment) and will cry out, \"Oh our Lord, these are the ones we used to worship besides You!\" In response, they will retort, \"You are liars","16:87":"On that day, they will extend an offer of peace towards Allah. The lies they used to invent will fritter away","16:88":"There are those who refuse to believe, and also place obstacles on the path of Allah. Because of their treachery, We will augment their agony by enhancing their punishment","16:89":"That day, against each nation We will summon one of their own as a witness, and (Oh Mohammed, SAW) against these people We will bring you out to testify. We have granted you this book, which explains everything. It is the guidance, the mercy and glad tidings for those who submit","16:90":"Indeed, Allah orders you to be fair and magnanimous, and to show kindness to the kinsfolk! He forbids immoral deeds, detestable acts and fornication. He counsels you; perhaps you will heed","16:91":"And if you undertake a pledge with Allah, live up to it. Do not break your vows once you have affirmed them and have invoked Allah as your guarantor! Allah knows what you do","16:92":"Do not be like the woman who spun her yarn into fine thread and then shredded it to pieces. You employ your oaths as mere ploys, so that your nation gains superiority over all others. In fact, Allah tests you with it! On the Day of Judgment, He will disclose to you all that you used to dispute","16:93":"Had Allah wished, He would have created you all as a single nation. But He guides or leads astray whomever He pleases. And you would very definitely be interrogated regarding everything you used to do","16:94":"And do not employ your oaths as ploys, lest you stumble again just as you are becoming steady on your feet.

It is the guidance and the glad tiding for the obedient","16:103":"And surely, We know what they allege! That a man has taught him (Mohammed, SAW)! The language of the one they allude to, however, is not Arabic, while this (Qur´an) is in precise and perfect Arabic","16:104":"Surely, Allah does not guide those who refuse to believe in the verses of Allah. For them, there is the painful punishment","16:105":"Surely, the unbelievers fabricate lies __ those who do not believe in the verses of Allah. They, indeed, are the liars","16:106":"The one who denies after having first believed __ not the one who is coerced (into unbelief) while his heart is firm on belief, but rather the one who rejects with the full approval of his heart __ earns the wrath of Allah.

Not a soul will be treated unjustly","16:112":"Allah cites the example of a peaceful and tranquil town. It enjoyed abundance and opulence. Its provisions came to it from every source. But its inhabitants showed ingratitude towards the blessings of Allah. So, as a result of their deeds, Allah wrapped them in famine and fear","16:113":"Indeed, a messenger __ from amongst their own people __ had already come to them. But they called him a liar! So the punishment grabbed them. They were evildoers","16:114":"Eat the allowable wholesome food Allah has provided, and show gratitude for the blessings of Allah __ if you in fact, worship Him exclusively","16:115":"Dead animal, blood and swine-flesh are what Allah has forbidden for you, and also the offerings made to deities other than Allah. But if someone (eats because he) is forced by dire necessity __ not out of desire or habit __ then, surely Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Kind","16:116":"You concoct lies about Allah! You blurt out and falsely claim some things to be permissible, others not! Those who fabricate lies about Allah will never prosper","16:117":"(After this) brief enjoyment, theirs is the painful punishment","16:118":"And for those who became Jews, We prescribed what We have described to you earlier.

We bolstered you with resources and offspring and caused you to abound in numbers. (And said)","17:7":"Your good deeds are for your own good, and similarly, your bad deeds are to afflict your own self!\" At the time of the second prediction, (We sent another nation) to mangle your faces and to run over your masjid just like the first time, and to lay in ruin everything they laid their hands on","17:8":"Maybe (now) your Lord will have mercy on you. But if you repeat (your offense), We shall reinstate (Our punishment).

Allah has prohibited it, except when it is rightful and befitting (and corresponds to the crime). We have awarded a right (of redress) to the heir of a person wrongfully killed.

You will assume that you had stayed on this earth only for a brief while","17:53":"Tell My servants to always say the right thing! Surely, Shaitan incites them to do evil. Shaitan is the professed enemy of the human beings","17:54":"Your Lord knows your circumstances very well. If He pleases He will have mercy on you, and He will punish you if He so please. (Oh Muhammad, SAW) We did not appoint you a manager over them","17:55":"Your Lord knows all those in the heavens and the earth.

This is inscribed in the book of decrees","17:59":"Nothing prevents Us from producing miracles. But the earlier people had rejected them! We assigned the camel as a proof for the people of ´Samood´, but they committed an outrage. We only display signs to serve as a warning","17:60":"(Remember) We said to you that your Lord has confined and contained people. We appointed the vision, _ the one we showed you _ and the mention of the cursed tree (the tree of ´zaqum´) in the Qur´an to be a trial for the people. We alerted them.

Rather, adopt a moderate tone","17:111":"And say, \"All praise is for Allah Who did not beget a son, and Who shares the Lordship of His domain with none! And He (has no weakness, therefore) requires no friend to mask any weakness. So, Glorify Him for His Greatness and Majesty","18:1":"All the praise belongs to Allah, Who revealed the book to His servant, and in it is included nothing queer","18:2":"(It is) straightforward, to sound a prior warning about His stern punishment, and to deliver the happy news to the believers, _ those of them with good deeds _ that theirs shall be the bountiful rewards","18:3":"In it (the paradise), they shall reside forever","18:4":"And to admonish those who claim that Allah has begotten a son","18:5":"Regarding that, neither they nor their forefathers had any knowledge. Presumptuous are the words that escape their lips! What they utter is nothing but a falsehood","18:6":"Would you, then, be overcome with sorrow and agonize over their refusal to accept this message (contained in the Qur´an)","18:7":"We have, in fact, fashioned everything in this world as mere adornments in order to test them! To see who amongst them performs the righteous deeds","18:8":"And We are definitely going to convert the earth into a bone-dry barren plateau","18:9":"Do you regard the companions of the cave and the inscription tablet (upon the cave) as exceptional marvels among Our signs","18:10":"Those young men sought refuge in the cave and said, \"Our Lord! By Your grace, grant us Your mercy and resolve our affairs suitably","18:11":"So, in that cave We lulled them to sleep for many years","18:12":"Then, (many years later) We awakened them so We may know which of their groups correctly estimates the length of their stay in the cave","18:13":"We narrate to you their true tale. The young men had faith in their Lord, and We enhanced them in guidance","18:14":"We fortified their hearts because they stood firm and said, \"Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth! We shall call upon no god other than Him. Else, we shall have severely exceeded the bounds","18:15":"This nation of ours accepts gods other than Him. Why do they not give a valid justification in support? Who then, is more evil than the one inventing lies about Allah","18:16":"Seek refuge in that cave, now that you have parted company with them, as well as those they worship other than Allah. Your Lord will shower His mercy upon you and will attend to your needs and comforts","18:17":"(Had you been there) you would see (the rays of) the sun _ as it rises and sets _ falling obliquely across the right of the cave and turning away past its left, while the men lay in the midst (of the cave). These are the signs of Allah. The rightly guided is the one whom Allah guides. You will not find any patron to guide the one who is led astray","18:18":"You would think they were awake, although they were asleep. We rolled them on their sides _ right and left. With outstretched limbs, their dog lay close to the entrance (of the cave). Had you just caught a glimpse of them, you would be struck with terror and you would turn around and flee","18:19":"Thus We awakened them so they may question one another. One of them asked, \"How long did we stay (here)?\" Others responded, \"A day! Perhaps less!\" They all said, \"Our Lord alone knows how long we stayed (in this cave). Let us send one of us to the town with this coin. With it, let him buy and bring to us the best, most wholesome food. And let him proceed with caution. Let no one know about you","18:20":"If they overcome you they may stone you to death, or compel you to rejoin their faith. In the later case, you will never ever be successful","18:21":"In that miraculous manner, We made them (the people) stumble upon (that cave). So that they would know for sure that Allah´s promise is real, and that there is no doubt about the hour (of judgment). But instead, they carried on their dispute and said, \"Let us build a monument over them. Only their Lord knows the truth about them!\" Those who were in charge said, \"We shall definitely turn the site into a place of worship","18:22":"They will say, \"(That they were) three, the fourth was their dog.\" Others also conjecture (and put the figure at) five, counting the dog six. Still others say, \"Seven! Their dog was the eighth.\" Say, \"My Lord knows their true number! Others know only very little.\" So, do not discuss that about them except cursorily, nor inquire anyone about them","18:23":"And regarding anything, do not say, \"I will do that tomorrow","18:24":"(Rather add), \"If Allah pleases!\" (Insha Allah)! Should you forget this, then remember your Lord (when you recall) and say, \"Perhaps, my Lord will lead me towards that which is more appropriate, and a sensible conduct","18:25":"They stayed in that cave for three centuries, and nine more years","18:26":"And say, \"Allah knows exactly how long they stayed! To Him belong the secrets of the heavens and the earth! He hears (everything) clearly, and He sees (everything) plainly. They have no patrons besides Him, and He includes none in His decisions and domain","18:27":"And recite (without modification) the revelation from the book of your Lord. No one may change the words of your Lord! (If you did) you will not find any safe place from Him","18:28":"Be contented with yourself and with those who pray to their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure. Do not turn your eyes away from them, nor seek the allure of the life of this world. Do not follow anyone who slams his mind shut upon Our advice, follows his own whims and is immoderate in his affairs","18:29":"Say, \"This is the truth! It is from your Lord! So, (now) whoever wants may believe it. If anyone wishes to disbelieve, let him.\" For the evildoers We have prepared a fire. Like a canopy of conflagration, it will surround them completely. They shall plead for help and shall be treated with water _ more like boiling oil _ which will scald their mouths. A miserable drink served in a wretched place","18:30":"And We will definitely not waste the rewards of the believers _ those who do good deeds","18:31":"These are the ones! There exists for them an eternal paradise with rivers flowing right through. As ornaments, they shall don bracelets made of gold, and their garments will be made of lush green silk and brocade. They shall rest poised on elevated thrones. What an excellent apparel in an exquisite place","18:32":"And quote the parable of the two men. We gave one of them two gardens of grapes, each bordered with date trees. Between (these gardens) We placed cultivated fields of green crops","18:33":"The vine gardens held back nothing. Both of them bore their fruit to the maximum. We ran a stream between the two gardens","18:34":"And thus he benefited a lot. While talking to his friend once, he said, \"I am better than you in wealth as well as slaves, sons and other personnel","18:35":"While entering his garden he committed an outrage upon his own self (he was boastful and cynical). He said, \"I do not think all this will ever perish","18:36":"The hour (of judgment) I think, will not occur. If at all I am sent back to my Lord, I shall find even better bounties reserved for me","18:37":"His companion conversed with him and said, \"Aren´t you being ungrateful to the One Who created you; first from dust then from a drop of semen, and then shaped you into a man","18:38":"As far as I am concerned, Allah is my Lord. I will never associate anyone with my Lord","18:39":"So, upon entering your garden, why did you not say, ´If Allah wills! (Insha Allah)´. There is no power except that of Allah! (At present) you find me possessing fewer children and riches than you do","18:40":"It is possible that my Lord may yet grant me a better garden, while he may strike yours (with a bolt) from the blue, leaving it slippery and barren","18:41":"Or its water may sink deep underground, and you will be unable to retrieve it","18:42":"(Destruction) closed in on his fruit all around. He wrung his hands in remorse and lamented over what he had spent (and lost) on the garden. It lay in ruin, dreary and desolate. He said, \"If only I hadn´t committed a ´shirk´ (ascribed associates) with my Lord","18:43":"Except Allah nobody could help him, nor could he help himself","18:44":"At that time (he knew that) the actual authority belongs only to Allah, the real and true (God). The rewards and consequences He bestows are far better","18:45":"And explain to them by quoting this example: the life of this world is like water We sent down from the sky. The plants assimilate it and become fresh and green. Later they turn into chaff, which the wind scatters around. Indeed, Allah has mastery over all things","18:46":"The wealth and children are mere adornments for the life of this world. In the eyes of Allah, the good deeds one leaves behind are better in terms of expectations and outcome","18:47":"You will see the earth turned into an even field when We cause the mountains to become pulverized (into clouds of dust). We will gather all of them together. None shall be absent","18:48":"They shall be made to line up before their Lord in rows. (Allah will say), \"Now! You have arrived before Us just as We created you the first time! And you thought We would not appoint a time (of reckoning) for you","18:49":"The book (of deeds) shall be placed. And you will find the criminals panicky, afraid of what it might contain. They will say, \"Oh, pity on us! What a book! Nothing is missing in it! Every single thing _ minor as well as major _ has been listed!\" They will find everything they ever did, described (in the book in detail). Your Lord will be unfair to no one","18:50":"When We ordered the Angels to prostrate themselves before Adam, they all did _ except Iblees (Shaitan). He is a jinn and he defied the command of your Lord. Yet, instead of Me (Allah) you accept him (Shaitan) and his descendants, as friends _ even though they are the enemies. Evil is the final end of the evil doers","18:51":"I did not let them witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor the creation of their own selves. I wouldn´t accept as aides those who lead men astray","18:52":"That day He will say, \"Go on! Scream and call (for help) all those you claimed were My partners\". And call they would, indeed! But they shall receive no response! We shall place a barrier between them","18:53":"The criminals (that day) will witness the hellfire, fearing that they will (inevitably) fall into it. They will find no way to escape","18:54":"Surely, We have mentioned in this Qur´an all sorts of examples for the people. But man happens to be more bickersome than anything","18:55":"Now that the guidance is here, nothing must keep people from believing and seeking forgiveness from their Lord. Else, the tradition of the earlier folks would be repeated, and they would come face to face with a severe torment","18:56":"We sent the messengers only as bearers of glad tidings, and as warners. But the unbelievers quarrel. They attempt to refute the truth with baseless discussions. They mock My signs and that about which they´re being warned","18:57":"Who could be worse than the one who turns away and shuns the signs of his Lord, even though he is being reminded of them? He forgets the kinds of deeds he has committed. Indeed, We have set a lid over their hearts; so they fail to understand (the Qur´an). There exists a heavy load in their ears. Therefore, you may call them towards the truth, but they shall not be led on to the right path","18:58":"Your Lord is the most Forgiving; He is the Lord of Mercy. If He were to grab them over all (the sins) they gather He would punish them instantly. But, their time (of reckoning) is preordained. Beyond that, they shall find no refuge","18:59":"We brought to ruin all those towns because they were wicked. We fixed a specific time for the destruction (of each town)","18:60":"(And tell them) when Musa said to his attendant, \"I will not give up. I will keep going till I reach the confluence of the rivers, even if it takes several years","18:61":"They reached the confluence, but forgot the fish (they had with them). It slipped away and found its way into the sea","18:62":"When they went past (the confluence) he (Musa) said to the attendant, \"Prepare our meal. We have really suffered so much fatigue in this journey","18:63":"The attendant replied, \"Did you see what happened? We were relaxing upon that cliff and I lost sight of the fish! It was Shaitan! He made me forget to mention it. The fish mysteriously found its way into the sea","18:64":"(Musa) said, \"That (sign) is precisely what we were looking for!\" So they retraced their steps and went back (to that cliff)","18:65":"There, they met Our servant. We had showered Our mercy upon him, and had taught him (a special) knowledge","18:66":"Musa asked, \"May I follow you? Can you impart to me the (special) guidance you have been taught","18:67":"He said, \"I am sure you will not be able to bear me with patience","18:68":"How can you remain patient about something you have no knowledge of","18:69":"(Musa) said, \"Allah willing, you will find me a patient person. I will not disobey you in any matter","18:70":"He said, \"You may accompany me but do not ask any questions until I bring the matter up myself","18:71":"So they proceeded till they boarded a ship. The man drilled a hole (in its keel). (Musa) said, \"You bore a hole in the ship to drown all its passengers. You have no doubt committed a dreadful act","18:72":"(The man) said, \"Did I not warn you? You will not be able to put up with me so patiently","18:73":"(Musa) said, \"Do not blame me. I forgot. Do not make me undergo such a trying situation","18:74":"They proceeded again till they met a lad. The man killed him. (Musa) said, \"You have taken an innocent life without any justification. Of course, you committed an evil act","18:75":"(The man) said, \"Did I not tell you? Indeed, you would be unable to bear me with patience","18:76":"(Musa) said, \"Don´t let me accompany you if I ask anything after this! There, you now have a reason (to part company)","18:77":"The two men resumed (their journey), reached a town and requested food. The townfolks refused to put them up as guests. In the town, the man found a wall about ready to crumble. (The man) repaired it. (Musa) said, \"Of course, if you wanted, you could have charged them for it","18:78":"(The Man) said, \"This is where we bid farewell to each other! I will give you the explanation of the things you could not endure","18:79":"As for the ship, it belongs to some poor folks who operate it in the sea. I sought to make it defective; a king nearby, seizes all the (defect-free) ships forcibly","18:80":"As for the boy, his parents are true believers. We feared that he would (grow up to) disobey them, oppress them and make them suffer tremendously","18:81":"We wished that their Lord would grant them in exchange a just, honest and a more merciful (offspring)","18:82":"And buried under the wall is a treasure. It belongs to two orphan brothers in town. Their father was pious! Your Lord decreed that (the boys) should discover (the treasure) when they attain the age of maturity. A mercy from your Lord. I did nothing of my own accord. That, in fact, was the reality which you witnessed but could not endure","18:83":"They inquire about Dhul Qurnain. Say, \"Here, I will tell you about him","18:84":"We established him firmly in the land and laid at his disposal the means to obtain everything","18:85":"He undertook a mission","18:86":"And reached the land of the setting sun. He saw the sun setting behind the murky hot springs. And he found a people living there nearby. We said, \"Oh Dhul Qurnain! You may punish them, or treat them nicely","18:87":"He said, \"We will punish the evil doer ourselves. Later, he returns to his Lord, Who will punish him with a woeful torture","18:88":"(Dhul Qurnain said), \"But the best of reward _ (paradise) _ is for the one who believes and acts righteously. We will treat him with kindness","18:89":"Then he undertook another mission (eastward)","18:90":"(And pressed on) till he reached the land of the rising sun. He found the sun rising upon a (primitive) people. We had not arranged any shelter for them against the sun","18:91":"Such (was their state); and We knew exactly what he (Dhul Qurnain) possessed","18:92":"Then he went on yet another mission","18:93":"Until he reached a mountainous area and found in the valley a people who understood almost nothing","18:94":"They said, \"These Yajog and Majog run amock in the land. May we pay you a tax to have a barrier erected between them and us","18:95":"Said, \"(Thanks, but) the power my Lord has granted is enough (and far better)! Just help me with your manpower. I shall build a wall between them and you","18:96":"Bring me blocks of steel.\" He blocked up the valley between the mountains (with a wall of steel) and said. \"Now start a fire and blow (air through your bellows) till the wall becomes red hot.\" Then he said, \"Bring me the molten copper to pour over the (iron) wall","18:97":"The barbarians could neither scale (the wall) nor breach it","18:98":"Said, \"This is my Lord´s mercy upon you! (However) when the time comes for (the fulfillment of) my Lord´s promise, He will demolish it! My Lord´s promise is absolutely true","18:99":"That day We will leave them rolling over each other (like waves), and then the trumpet will sound and We will gather them all together","18:100":"And We shall display and bring within sight hell for the unbelievers","18:101":"Those, whose eyes are sheathed (and insulated) against My reminder (the Qur´an) cannot stand even to listen to it","18:102":"Did the unbelievers suppose that they can take _ instead of Me _ My slaves as their masters and get away with it? Indeed! To do them the honors, We have prepared hell","18:103":"Say, \"May we tell you about the worst of the losers","18:104":"They are those who (in reality) squander away their efforts in the life of this world, yet regard their deeds to be good","18:105":"Such are the ones who reject the signs of their Lord and the (forthcoming) meeting with Him. So their efforts amount to nothing. On the Day of Judgment, We shall assign them no weight at all","18:106":"They shall have their reward _ hell. Because they disbelieved, and mocked My signs and My messengers","18:107":"On the other hand, those who believe and do good deeds shall be honored with (the gift of) the gardens of paradise","18:108":"There they shall live forever. They shall never desire to depart","18:109":"Say, \"Had the ocean served as ink to write about Allah, then surely the ocean would run out, but the narrative about Allah would not. Even if We supplied that much more ink as a refill","18:110":"Say, \"Surely, I am just a man like you. Revelation has been sent to me that your God is only one God! Hence, those hoping to meet their Lord should seek the righteous acts, and should not accept any partners in the worship of their Lord","19:1":"Kaaf, Ya, Ain, Saad","19:2":"This is the account of the blessings of your Lord upon Zakaria, His servant","19:3":"When once he addressed his Lord in a soft voice","19:4":"Said, \"Lord! My bones have weakened and my head has lit up with the gray hair (of old age). I haven´t so far been denied anything I ever prayed to You for","19:5":"I am concerned for my followers after my death. My wife is barren. But, please Lord! Grant me by Your grace a successor (son)","19:6":"One who may inherit from me and from the family of Yaqub, and Lord, please let him be amongst those with whom You are well-pleased","19:7":"Oh Zakaria, We give you the good news of a son. His name shall be Yahya! Never before have We created anyone with his kind of qualities","19:8":"Said, \"Lord! How could I have a son now? My wife is barren and I have attained a ripe old age","19:9":"Said, \"That shall be!\" Your Lord said, \"This is really easy for Me! I also gave you existence earlier when you were nothing","19:10":"Said, \"Lord! Assign a sign for me.\" Said, \"Despite being healthy, you shall be unable to speak for three days. That shall be your sign","19:11":"He emerged from the chamber, and gestured to his followers asking them to sing the praises (of Allah), morning and evening","19:12":"Oh Yahya! Hold on to the book with all your might!\" We gave him the wisdom even as a lad","19:13":"And by Our grace, We granted him compassion and purity; he was pious","19:14":"He was devoted and kind to his parents; not defiant or arrogant","19:15":"Peace be upon him, the day he was born! The day he died! And the day he shall be brought back to life","19:16":"And mention Mary in your narration. Once she excused herself from her family and retired to the eastern wing of the house","19:17":"She drew the curtain behind her and there, We sent Our spirit (angel) to her! It appeared before her in the figure of a full grown man","19:18":"She cried out, \"I seek the protection of Rehman (the Merciful) from you, if you are a God-fearing person","19:19":"He said, \"What I am, is a messenger of your Lord to bestow upon you a pious son","19:20":"Said, \"How might I have a son? No man has ever touched me, nor am I a woman of loose morals","19:21":"Said \"It shall be! Your Lord says ´It is really too easy for Me´! It is preordained and shall come to pass, so as to make him a sign for the humankind and a blessing from Us´","19:22":"She conceived and moved to a place far away","19:23":"The distress of labor brought her under a date-palm tree. She said to herself, \"I wish I was dead, long gone and forgotten before this ever happened","19:24":"He (the angel) called her from close by, \"Do not feel sorry for yourself. Your Lord has issued forth a spring right close to where you are","19:25":"Shake the trunk of the date tree. Moist ripe dates will break loose and fall down","19:26":"Eat, drink and stay calm. Should any one happen to pass by, tell him you are observing a fast for the sake of Rehman, (the Merciful), and hence shall not talk to anyone","19:27":"She returned to her folks carrying him (the baby). They said, \"Oh Mary! What an unprecedented act have you committed","19:28":"Oh sister of Haroon! Your father was not wicked! Nor was your mother a loose woman","19:29":"She pointed towards the infant. They said, \"How can we converse with an infant lying in a crib","19:30":"The infant said, \"I am the servant of Allah! He appointed me His messenger, and granted me the gospel","19:31":"He blessed me wherever I might happen to be, and has ordered me to enjoin the ´salat´ and the ´zakat´ as long as I am alive","19:32":"(I am) devoted to my mother, not hapless and arrogant","19:33":"Peace upon me the day I was born. The day I shall die. And the day I shall be brought back to life","19:34":"Such was Jesus, the son of Mary! This is the real truth about him, which they dispute","19:35":"It is not befitting of Allah to have a son. Exalted is He! Having decided the matter, He merely tells it, \"Be!\" Hence it becomes","19:36":"Indeed, Allah is my Lord as well as your Lord! So worship Him. That is the straight path","19:37":"Groups have disputed amongst themselves regarding the day (of judgment). Witnessing that great day shall be disastrous for those who deny its coming","19:38":"On the day they shall come to Us, their vision and hearing shall be sharper! Today the evil-doers are clearly lost in their misguidance","19:39":"Warn them of the regretful embarrassment of the day when the matter shall be decided and put to rest! Today they are in heedless and neglectful denial, and they do not believe","19:40":"We shall inherit the earth, including all that is upon it. Towards Us they all shall return","19:41":"And mention Ibraheem in the book; he was a truthful person and a prophet","19:42":"He said to his father, \"Oh Father! Why do you worship that which neither sees, nor hears, nor can protect you from anything","19:43":"Oh Father, true knowledge did not come to you, but has come to me. So follow me, I shall lead you along the balanced path","19:44":"Oh Father, do not obey Shaitan. Indeed, Shaitan is disobedient to Rehman","19:45":"I am worried, Oh Father, that a great torment might fall upon you from Rehman, and that you might end up as a comrade of Shaitan","19:46":"He said, \"Have you turned away from your gods, oh Ibraheem? Desist, for if you do not, I shall stone you to death. Out of my sight, now","19:47":"Said, \"Peace be upon you. I shall ask my Lord to forgive you. He is really very kind to me","19:48":"I hereby wash my hands of you, and those you call gods besides Allah. I will worship my Lord! I am confident, If I pray to Him, I shall not be deprived","19:49":"After he abandoned them along with those whom they called gods beside Allah, We gave him Ishaq and Yaqub. We appointed each of them a prophet","19:50":"We showered Our blessings upon them and gave them high honor","19:51":"And mention Musa in the book. He was really chosen, a prophet and a messenger","19:52":"We called him out from the right side of the mountain Toor, and pulled him close, so as to grant him a private audience","19:53":"And We gave his brother, Haroon, to him as a prophet, a blessing from Us","19:54":"And mention Ismail in the book. Indeed, he was true to his words, a prophet and a messenger","19:55":"He obligated ´salat´ and ´zakat´ upon his family. In the eyes of his Lord, he was an adorable person","19:56":"And in the book, mention Idrees. Indeed, he was a truthful person and a prophet","19:57":"We raised him to an exalted status","19:58":"These are the ones Allah showered His blessings upon. These prophets were the descendants of Adam, and the descendants of those We boarded on the boat with Nooh. They were the descendants of Ibraheem and Ismail. Those were the ones We picked for Our guidance! Such were they that when Our verses were recited to them, they fell prostrate on the ground, tears welling up in their eyes","19:59":"They were succeeded by ignorant ones, those who squandered their \"salat´ and followed their whims and the pleasures of the flesh. Their just deserts shall soon catch up with them","19:60":"Except those who repent, believe, and perform good deeds. They will enter paradise. They will not be dealt with unfairly","19:61":"Rehman has promised this paradise to His servants for eternity, in exchange for their belief in the unseen. Surely His promise will be fulfilled","19:62":"In it, they shall hear nothing vulgar; only peace! There, each day and each night, their due portion (sustenance) shall be delivered to them","19:63":"Such is the paradise, which We will allow only Our pious servants to inherit","19:64":"(Angels said), \"We descend only when ordered by your Lord. To Him belongs all that lies before us, behind us, and in between. Your Lord is not the One to forget","19:65":"He is the sustainer of the heavens and the earth, and all else in between. So worship Him in steadfast obedience. Do you know any other comparable to Him","19:66":"(Yet), man says \"When I am dead, will I emerge back to life again","19:67":"Does man not recall? It was We Who created him earlier, when he was nothing","19:68":"By your Lord! Very definitely! We shall gather them and the Shaitans together. Then, certainly, We shall collect them all around the hellfire, in a manner that they shall be crawling on their knees","19:69":"Thereafter, We shall definitely bring forth from each group of people the one who had been the most ardent and rebellious opponent of Rehman","19:70":"Of course, We know very well who amongst them deserves to burn in hell","19:71":"There isn´t any of you who can avoid passing by the hellfire. Your Lord has made this incumbent upon Himself","19:72":"Then, We will let the transgressors fall tumbling down into it, but We will rescue those who have been heedful and pious","19:73":"When Our clear lucid verses are recited, those who disbelieve the verses taunt those who believe by saying, \"Which of the two of us has a better abode, and enjoys and mingles with better and more distinguished company","19:74":"Many groups have We destroyed prior to them. They were better equipped, better furnished and better in appearance","19:75":"Say, \"Rehman gives leeway to those who indulge in gross negligence until they get to see that which is promised to be their lot, either the punishment (in this world) or the hour (of judgment)! They would soon realise whose status is lower! Whose allies are weaker","19:76":"Allah increases in guidance those who are on the straight path, and the results of their good deeds are better with Allah in terms of rewards and consequences","19:77":"Did you see the one who has chosen to deny Our signs and yet says, \"I shall definitely be granted wealth and children","19:78":"Has he peeked into the unseen? or has he entered into a contract with Rehman","19:79":"Indeed not! Rather, We are recording everything he says. We shall extend his punishment a great deal further","19:80":"We shall repossess all that he owns. And We shall bring him out all alone","19:81":"They have taken gods other than Allah, so that they may have supporters","19:82":"No! Indeed, their false gods will disown their worship, and they will become adversaries","19:83":"Do you not notice? We send the Shaitans upon the disbelievers, and they continually incite and instigate them","19:84":"Do not be impatient with them. We are counting down their days","19:85":"That day, We will gather the pious (God-fearing) as guests of Rehman","19:86":"While the sinners will be like thirst-stricken animals, whom We will shove towards the hellfire","19:87":"No one has the ability to intervene, except those whom Rehman has promised","19:88":"What? Do they say Rehman (God) has a son","19:89":"They have surely brought forth a grave thing","19:90":"So grave, indeed, that it may cause the earth to explode into pieces! Or the mountains may come tumbling down! Or the heavens might just crack asunder","19:91":"They have dared to assign a son for Rehman","19:92":"It is not befitting for Rehman to have a son","19:93":"Every being in the heavens and on the earth shall come before Rehman as a slave","19:94":"He is aware of their exact number, and He has counted them all up","19:95":"On the Day of Judgment, each of them shall arrive all alone, and shall be on his own","19:96":"And of course, Rehman will instill with love, the hearts of those who believe and do the righteous deeds","19:97":"We have made this (Quran) easy for you, in your own language, in order that you may give the glad tidings to the pious and the God-fearing. With it, you may warn those that are belligerent","19:98":"Many a people have We destroyed before them. So now, can you sense even a faint sign of their existence, or hear even a wisp of their tale","20:1":"Ta, Ha","20:2":"We have revealed to you this Qur´an, not to cause you distress","20:3":"Rather, it is a memorandum _ (an advisory) _ for the one who fears","20:4":"A communiqué from the Creator of the earth and the celestial heavens","20:5":"Rehman, (the most magnificent), mounted the throne (and governs the universe majestically)","20:6":"To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and on the earth, whatever lies between them, and whatever exists under (the surface of the earth)","20:7":"You call Him out loud. (But remember), He knows even the most intimate thoughts _ thoughts that remain hidden (and unexpressed) forever","20:8":"He is Allah! There is no god but He; His are all the beautiful names","20:9":"Is the story of Musa known to you","20:10":"When he spotted a campfire, he said to his family, \"I notice a fire! Perhaps, I can bring a live coal from there (to start our own fire), or obtain directions (for the road ahead)","20:11":"When he approached (the site of) the campfire, We called out to him, \"Oh Musa","20:12":"It is I, your Lord! Take your shoes off! You happen to be in the holy valley of Toah","20:13":"I chose you! So listen to what is being revealed","20:14":"Indeed, I am the One _ Allah! There is no god except Me! So obey Me and establish the ´salat´ (prayers) to remember Me","20:15":"In fact, the hour (of Judgment) is sure to arrive! I want to keep (its time) undisclosed, so that every soul may be rewarded in accordance with its efforts","20:16":"Hence, Do not ever let an unbeliever _ the one following his own whims _ dissuade you from it (the belief in the afterlife), lest you perish","20:17":"And what is that (you hold) in your right (hand), oh Musa","20:18":"Said, \"It is my stick. I lean on it to rest my weight, and with it I chop off the leaves to feed my cattle. It also has other uses for me","20:19":"Said, \"Throw it down, Oh Musa","20:20":"So he threw it down, and all of a sudden, it became a snake creeping around (swiftly)","20:21":"(Allah) said, \"Grab it, and do not be afraid. We will change it back to its earlier state","20:22":"And place your hand in your armpit. (As you pull your hand out) it will appear dazzling white without any discomfort. Another sign","20:23":"To show you (but just two of) Our great signs","20:24":"Go to the pharaoh! He has exceeded (every) limit","20:25":"(Musa) said, \"Lord, unlock my heart","20:26":"And make my task easy for me","20:27":"And correct my speech impediment","20:28":"(So) they understand my words","20:29":"And appoint one of my family members (as an aide) to help me","20:30":"My brother, Haroon","20:31":"With him, bolster my strength","20:32":"And make him a partner in my mission","20:33":"So, we may glorify You a lot","20:34":"And talk about You a lot","20:35":"And certainly, You are watching over us","20:36":"Said, \"You are being granted your requests, oh Musa","20:37":"We, in fact, conferred favors upon you at other times, too","20:38":"When We inspired your mother by implanting an idea in her mind","20:39":"(Saying) \"Put (the child) in a box and push (the box) down the river. It will hurl (the box) ashore, where Our enemy _ his and Mine _ will pick him up.\" I bestowed love upon you, so you may be raised under My watchful eye","20:40":"(Remember) when your sister walked (along the box) and said to those who found the child, \"Shall I guide you to a wet nurse for him?\" Thus We sent you back to your mother, to soothe her and to keep her from grieving. Then you killed a man. We rescued you from that distress. We had you go through a terrible ordeal. You lived with the people of Madyan a number of years. And now, you have arrived here at just the right (preordained) time","20:41":"Oh Musa, I have selected you specifically for My sake","20:42":"So proceed with My signs, both of you _ you and your brother. Do not become lax in remembering Me","20:43":"Go to the pharaoh! Indeed, he has transgressed","20:44":"But speak to him in an affable manner. Maybe he will heed, and fear (Allah)","20:45":"They said, \"Our Lord! We are afraid that he will let loose his rage upon us and will oppress us","20:46":"Said, \"Have no fear! I am with you, watching over and listening","20:47":"So go to him and say, \"We are the messengers of your Lord! Therefore, let the Israelites go with us and do not torture them. We have already brought you the proof from your Lord! Peace is upon him, who follows the guidance","20:48":"Indeed, it has been revealed to us that punishment awaits the one who denies and turns away","20:49":"(The pharaoh) asked, \"So then, who is your Lord, oh Musa","20:50":"Said, \"The One Who gave each (existing) thing its nature and form, then guided it along","20:51":"(The pharaoh) asked, \"Then, what about the generations of yester years","20:52":"Musa said, \"The facts about them are known to my Lord and recorded in a book. He neither errs nor forgets","20:53":"The same One Who made the earth your (safe) haven, carved roads in it for you, and sent water down from the sky.\" With that (water), We bring out vegetation of many diverse kinds","20:54":"Eat! And feed your cattle, too. Indeed, in it is a sign for those who (accept) reason","20:55":"We created you from this (very) earth. Into it We shall have you return, and from it We shall bring you out a second time","20:56":"Surely, We had him look at all Our signs, but he rejected (them all) and refused (to believe)","20:57":"(The pharaoh) said, \"Are you here to drive us out of our land with your magic, oh Musa","20:58":"And added, \"Of course, we can perform that kind of magic too. So, go ahead! For our encounter pick a time and place _ a neutral location (accessible to all). We will not fail to show up. Nor should you","20:59":"(Musa) said, \"Let the coming festival day be the appointed date, and let the people gather at high noon","20:60":"So, the pharaoh withdrew and with craftiness, put together a scheme, and then he arrived","20:61":"Musa said to them. \"Woe unto you! Do not make up lies against Allah. He will annihilate you (all) with a torment. Whoever invents lies against Allah fails","20:62":"At that point, they began to dispute among themselves and held secret talks","20:63":"At length they said, \"These two are just magicians trying to evict you from your land by their spells. They want to deprive you of your exemplary way of life","20:64":"So rally all your tricks, then act in unison. Whoever triumphs today will prosper","20:65":"They said, \"Oh Musa, either you cast (your spell) first, or else let us be the first to cast (the spell)","20:66":"(Musa) said, \"No! You go first. Then suddenly, because of their spell, it appeared to him that their ropes and sticks (were snakes and) were creeping about swiftly","20:67":"A sense of fear came over Musa","20:68":"We said, \"Do not be afraid. You will be the one to triumph, for sure","20:69":"Throw down the stick in your right hand. It will gobble up the spell they have cast. What they have conjured up is only a trick of the magicians, and magicians never succeed when they come (to face the truth)","20:70":"The magicians lost out, threw themselves down on the ground prostrate, and said, \"We accept the Lord of Haroon and Musa","20:71":"The pharaoh said, \"You believed him, even though I did not permit you? Obviously, he is your master who has taught you the magic! Now, I will definitely chop off your hands and feet on opposite sides and then crucify you on the trunk of the date-palm tree. You will soon know which one of us awards the severer and the more lasting punishment","20:72":"They said, \"In the face of the clear signs that have come to us, we will not prefer you to the One Who has created us. So do whatever you decree. Surely, you exercise control (only) in the life of this world","20:73":"We have really believed in our Lord! So He may forgive our sins, as well as the magic you compelled us to perform. Allah is better, and the Immortal","20:74":"Indeed, hell is for the one who comes to his Lord as a criminal. There, he will never die _ nor live","20:75":"The exalted ranks are for those who come to their Lord as believers, having done righteous deeds","20:76":"(As also) the elevated gardens, through which run the rivers. There, they shall live forever! This is the reward for those who endeavor to purify themselves","20:77":"Indeed, We revealed to Musa, \"Go and take My servants with you. Strike a dry path through the sea. Do not be frightened of being overtaken (by the Pharaoh in hot pursuit), nor be afraid (of the sea)","20:78":"The pharaoh pursued them with his army. They were drowned by that which engulfed them from all sides","20:79":"The pharaoh led his nation astray _ did not guide well","20:80":"Oh Children of Israel! We rescued you from your enemy, granted you an audience by the right side of the mountain ´Toor´, and sent down the ´munna´ and the ´salwa´ for you","20:81":"Eat the wholesome food We have provided, but do not be overly excessive. Else, My wrath will come down upon you. Surely, the one upon whom lands My fury, comes tumbling down","20:82":"Yet, undoubtedly, I am the One Who grants forgiveness to anyone who repents, believes and acts righteously; and then stays steadfast (till death)","20:83":"(Allah asked), \"What made you come (to Me) ahead of your people, oh Musa","20:84":"Said, \"They´re coming right behind. I hurried towards You, Lord, so You may be pleased","20:85":"(Allah) said, \"After you left, We subjected your people to a test. Saamari led them astray","20:86":"So Musa returned to his nation, angry and aggrieved, and said, \"Oh my people, did your Lord not make you excellent promises? Has it been too long for you? Or do you just want the fury of your Lord to land on you? Is that why you broke your pledge with me","20:87":"They said, \"We did not willfully opt to break our promise to you. In fact, the burden of carrying people´s jewelry had worn us down. So we unloaded it (into the fire). Likewise, Saamari threw it down, too","20:88":"Then, he shaped the gold into the figure of a calf, and it mooed like one! People cried out, \"This is your God. The God of Musa. He forgot (to mention it)","20:89":"Did they not see that it did not respond to them at all? Nor did it have the ability to hurt them, or help them","20:90":"Even though Haroon had told them earlier, \"Oh my people! You are being tested with it (the calf). Really, your Lord is the most Merciful. So follow me, all of you! And obey my command","20:91":"They said, \"We will not quit worshipping (the calf) until Musa comes back","20:92":"Musa (when he returned) said, \"Oh Haroon, when you saw them going astray, what held you back","20:93":"Why did you not follow me? Did you disobey my instructions","20:94":"Haroon said, \"Oh son of my mother! Do not tug at my beard, nor pull my hair! I was afraid you would blame me and say ´You caused a split among the Israelites, and did not follow my instruction.´","20:95":"Said, \"And what about you, Oh Saamari","20:96":"(Saamari) said, \"I realized what others failed to. So I collected a handful (of dust) from the footmarks of the prophets and tossed it on the calf. That is what my self prompted me to do","20:97":"(Musa) said, \"Go! This is (the punishment) for you: in this life you will (continually) utter ´Do not touch me´, and you have an appointment (in the afterlife) which you cannot skip. Now watch that god of yours, upon whose worship you insisted. We will surely melt it down, then scatter it around in the ocean","20:98":"As a matter of fact, Allah (alone) is your God! Besides Him there is no other god, and His knowledge extends over all things","20:99":"Thus, We narrate to you the tales of what went on earlier. We have granted you this (book of) advisement from Ourselves","20:100":"Indeed, those ignoring it shall bear a burdensome punishment on the Day of Judgment","20:101":"They shall forever remain in it _ (that condition of torment). Baneful shall be their burden on the Day of Judgment","20:102":"The day the trumpet sounds will be the day We will gather the criminals, their eyes agape with fright","20:103":"Among themselves they will whisper, \"You stayed (on the earth) only ten days","20:104":"Of course We know very well what they shall say. The most accurate among them will say, \"You stayed there for just a day","20:105":"They are asking you about the mountains. Tell them, \"My Lord will blow them up into fine dust","20:106":"He will turn (this earth) into a plain wasteland","20:107":"You will not find any ridges or cracks on it","20:108":"On that day, they will (meekly) respond to the convener _ (the angel) _ who shall face no hindrance. In the presence of Rehman, voices will drop to a subdued hush. You shall hear nothing but faint whispers","20:109":"That day, mediation shall benefit no one, unless Rehman grants permission, and about whom He pleases to hear (favorable) remarks","20:110":"He knows all that lies ahead of them as well as everything about their past. Others do not know at all","20:111":"All heads will bow before the Eternally Alive and the Ever-lasting. Anyone carrying a burden of having committed an injustice shall fail miserably","20:112":"(Whereas) those who had acted righteously _ provided they had believed _ shall have no fear of being wronged or short changed","20:113":"Thus, We revealed this Qur´an in Arabic. In it We have defined sharply the promises and the threats. Maybe they will fear (Allah), or it _ (the Qur´an) _ will bring back the remembrance (of Allah)","20:114":"Allah, the Genuine Emperor, is the most Exalted! Do not be in a hurry to repeat (the fresh verses of) the Qur´an before the revelations conclude. Say, \"Lord, enhance me in knowledge","20:115":"Earlier, We had entrusted Adam with a task, but his memory lapsed. We did not find in him the firmness of resolve","20:116":"(Remember)! We said to the angels, \"Fall down prostrate before Adam!\" And they all fell prostrate, except Iblees (Shaitan). He refused","20:117":"So We said, \"Oh Adam, that one, surely, is your and your wife´s enemy. Now do not let him drive you out of paradise, lest you feel distressed","20:118":"Of course, here (in paradise), it is your (privilege) that you do not go hungry, nor are you unclad","20:119":"And here you are not thirsty, troubled by the (sultry sweltering) sun","20:120":"Yet Shaitan whispered (and aroused) doubts in his mind saying, \"Oh Adam, shall I show you the tree of immortality, and the domain that has no demise","20:121":"Both of them _ (Adam and his wife) _ ate its fruit and their genitalia became visible to them. With the leaves of the Garden of Eden they began to cover themselves. Adam disobeyed his Lord and went astray","20:122":"Later, his Lord favored him, granted him forgiveness and guided him","20:123":"(Allah) said, \"Get down from here! Both of you _ (Adam and Shaitan)! You are each other´s enemy. Whoever follows the guidance _ when the guidance from Me arrives _ will not go astray, and will not be miserable","20:124":"While a wretched (unwholesome) livelihood will be the lot of the one who turns away from My advice and warning. He will be blind when We round him up on the Day of Judgment","20:125":"He shall say, \"Lord, why did You raise me blind? I used to be endowed with eyesight","20:126":"Allah will say, \"Much the same as you ignored My signs when they came to you! Befittingly, today you are being ignored","20:127":"This is how We chastise the one who exceeds the bounds, and ignores the signs of his Lord. The punishment of the afterlife is far worse and ever persisting","20:128":"Many towns have We destroyed before them. Did that fact not teach them? They walk through those ruins! There are surely signs in it for those with intellect","20:129":"The word of your Lord has been proclaimed! Had it not been, and if it wasn´t essential and for a specific period, (then their doom and demise would be instant)","20:130":"Therefore, with patience bear their remarks and chant the praises of your Lord before the sun rises, before it sets, and during the night. Glorify Him in the morning and evening. Perhaps you will feel contented","20:131":"Do not look (enviously) at the splendors of this life with which We have furnished some of their groups. It is (merely) to test them. The grants of your Lord (in the afterlife) are far better and ever lasting","20:132":"Bid your family to observe the ´salat´, and stay steadfast upon it yourself. We do not seek sustenance from you. Indeed, We bestow sustenance. The final outcome hinges on piety","20:133":"They say, \"Why did he not bring us a sign?\" Did clear proofs _ those narrated in the earlier scriptures _ not reach them","20:134":"Had We, prior to sending him (Muhammad, SAW), ruined them with a disaster, they would have complained, \"Our Lord, if only You had sent us a messenger, we would have followed Your signs instead of being disgraced and humiliated","20:135":"Say, \"Each (soul) is in a state of waiting. You wait, too! Soon you will find out who is on the right path, and well-guided","21:1":"Their reckoning has drawn closer, but people are turning away in unmindful ignorance","21:2":"When a fresh narrative from their Lord reaches them, they (barely) hear it, then they resume their pastimes","21:3":"Their minds absorbed in pleasures, the evil doers whisper under their breaths, \"Isn´t he just a human being like you all? Will you then, succumb to his magic knowingly","21:4":"The messenger said, \"My Lord knows everything uttered in the heavens and on earth. He is the All-hearing and the All-knowing","21:5":"And they said, \"Vague meaningless dreams, or he has made it up, or he is a poet. Else, let him present to us a miracle like the earlier (messengers) did","21:6":"Those towns _ the ones We destroyed in the past _ had also failed to believe. So now, will they believe","21:7":"We have always commissioned men (as messengers) and sent revelations to them, even before your time. Should you not know (this fact), ask the people of the scriptures","21:8":"We did not fashion their physiques, so as to enable them to live without food, nor did they live forever","21:9":"Then, We fulfilled Our pledge and rescued them, and those whom We wished. We destroyed those who had exceeded their limits","21:10":"We have sent you this book. In it are narrations about your own self. So why do you not understand","21:11":"Many towns have We dashed into fragments. They were evil! Then We brought other nations in their place","21:12":"When they experienced Our power, they suddenly began to flee","21:13":"Do not run away! Return to your homes and the luxurious comforts you were given. You will be called (to account)","21:14":"They said, \"Misery to us! We surely were evil","21:15":"They kept saying that right until We turned them into the plucked out harvest","21:16":"We did not create the heavens and the earth and everything in between as an amusement (and a pastime)","21:17":"Had We wanted just to have fun, and if We were (given to) doing that, We would have done so all by Ourselves","21:18":"On the contrary, We run the truth against falsehood, over which it triumphs. In time, the falsehood is bound to come to naught! Misery to you for what you attribute","21:19":"Every living being in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him, and no one in His presence _ either out of pride or regret _ shies away from worshipping Him","21:20":"All day and all night, they chant His praises. They do not relent","21:21":"Have they accepted other gods on the earth? Do those other gods bring the dead back to life","21:22":"The heavens and the earth would run into chaos had there been other gods beside Allah. Exalted is Allah, the Lord of the heavenly throne, far above what they utter","21:23":"He is not answerable for His actions, while all others are (to Him)","21:24":"Have they accepted other gods beside Him? Say, \"Present your proof! Here is this reminder (the Qur´an) for those with me, and there are the scriptures for those before me.\" Most people actually do not know the truth, and so they ignore","21:25":"Never was there a messenger before you to whom We did not reveal, \"There is no god except Me, so worship Me (exclusively)","21:26":"They say, \"Rehman has adopted a son!\" Glorified is He! Rather, they are all (just His) honored servants","21:27":"They dare not initiate an audience with Him, and they diligently carry out His orders","21:28":"He knows everything that lies ahead of them and everything about their past. They do not intercede for anyone except for those He is pleased with. They are attentive! And stand in awe and reverence of Him","21:29":"We will award hell to anyone amongst them who says, \"I am a god besides Him.\" That is how We punish the transgressors","21:30":"Do the unbelievers not consider the fact that the heavens and the earth were joined together? We split them asunder! And from water, We created every living being! Do they not believe (that)","21:31":"We pitched mountains firmly on the earth, lest it makes them sway. (Between the mountains) We cut roads and paths, so they may find their way","21:32":"And (for you), We deemed the sky to be a safe and secure ceiling. Yet, these are the signs they overlook","21:33":"And He is the One Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Each is afloat in its orbit","21:34":"We have never bestowed immortality upon any human, including you, (Oh Muhammad, SAW). So you will die! But will they live forever","21:35":"Every living being must taste death! We put you through trials, and We test all of you with (different) things _ bad as well as good! Then, towards Us, you shall all return","21:36":"When the unbelievers see you, they treat you with scorn, (saying), \"Is he the one who speaks (ill) of our gods?\" While they themselves are such a sort that they refuse to accept any mention of Rehman","21:37":"Man is created hasty. Very soon, I will have you see My signs! Do not be in such haste","21:38":"And they say, \"If you are truthful, tell us. When will that promise (of the afterlife) come about","21:39":"If the unbelievers could only imagine the moment when they will struggle in vain to ward off the fire from their faces and their backs! They shall have no help","21:40":"It will come upon them all of a sudden, and it will bewilder them. They will be unable to turn it away, and they shall have no respite (another chance)","21:41":"During earlier times, too, they made fun of the messengers. But the mockery came back to haunt (and surround) those who used to mock","21:42":"Say, \"Who will watch over you during the night and the day, and protect you against (the wrath of) Rehman?\" No! In fact, they turn away from the remembrance of their Lord","21:43":"Or do they have other gods to guard them against Us? Those ´gods´ are unable to help even their own selves. Nor can they be guarded against Us","21:44":"Rather, We had them and their forefathers enjoy (life) till they grew old. Do they not notice? We keep on shrinking the land from all sides. So then, can they triumph","21:45":"Say, \"The fact is, by this revelation I warn you!\" But the deaf do not hear what they are being warned against","21:46":"Even if a whiff of Our punishment were to hit them, they would surely cry out, \"Oh misery to us, we were indeed the evil doers","21:47":"We will indeed bring out the scales of justice on the Day of Judgment. No soul shall be wronged a bit. We will bring out (into focus) all deeds, even those (insignificant enough to be) worth a tiny bit of a mustard seed. And Our presence shall suffice to hold the reckoning","21:48":"We had indeed granted Musa and Haroon the proof, the illuminating light and the (right) advice for those who fear","21:49":"Those who fear their unseen Lord and dread the hour of judgment","21:50":"This (Qur´an), now, is the blessed narration We have sent! So then, are you refusing to acknowledge it","21:51":"Much earlier, We granted Ibraheem the maturity of mind","21:52":"When he once said to his father and his people, \"What are these statues you are worshipping so devoutly","21:53":"They replied, \"We found our forefathers praying to them","21:54":"Said, \"Surely, you and your forefathers were gravely misguided","21:55":"They said, \"Are you expressing your real views or are you just kidding","21:56":"Indeed not! Your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the One Who brought them into being. I bear witness to this (Truth)","21:57":"Said, \"I swear by Allah, I have plans for your idols when you go away and leave them","21:58":"So he battered them to pieces, except the one most prominent. Maybe they would turn to it","21:59":"They said, \"Who did this to our gods? He is really very cruel","21:60":"Some said, \"We heard a lad called Ibraheem talking about them","21:61":"They said, \"Bring him out to face the people. So they may observe (his fate)","21:62":"They asked, \"Did you do that to our gods, oh Ibraheem","21:63":"Said, \"Rather, this one, their chief did that! Therefore, ask them if they can talk","21:64":"They felt a pinch of conscience and (their inner voice) said, \"Really, it is you who is being unjust","21:65":"But they brushed that thought aside and said, \"Of course, they do not talk! And you know it","21:66":"He said, \"Why then do you worship those besides Allah. They grant you no benefits, nor inflict any harm","21:67":"Damn you, and those you worship beside Allah! Do you not understand at all","21:68":"They cried, \"Burn him at the stake! Rush to the aid of your gods! Act, if you will","21:69":"We commanded, \"Oh fire, simmer down, and let there be peace upon Ibraheem","21:70":"They wanted to hurt him, but We caused them to be the real losers","21:71":"Towards the blessed land, We had him and Loot escape. We had blessed it for the whole world","21:72":"We gave Ibraheem a present: a son, Ishaq and (the grandson), Yaqub. We made each of them righteous","21:73":"We made them both the patriarch _the leaders. As per Our instructions, they guided their people, and We revealed to them the acts of righteousness: the establishing of ´salat´ and the paying of \"zakat\". Both of them were Our devotees","21:74":"As for Loot, We gave him wisdom and knowledge and rescued him from the people who committed the gravest of sins. They were indeed a very evil people","21:75":"We admitted (Loot) into Our mercy; he was amongst the righteous","21:76":"And prior to that, Nooh prayed to Us and We responded. We saved him and his family from a great torment","21:77":"We came to his aid against a nation that had denied Our signs. They were an evil people, indeed. So We drowned them all _ every single one of them","21:78":"And don´t forget Daood and Sulaiman as they sat in judgment, hearing the case of the field that had been overrun at night by goats of other folks. We were overseeing their judgment","21:79":"We unveiled (the right ruling) to Sulaiman. We had granted wisdom and courage to both. For Daood, We had tamed the mountains and the birds. They used to chant praises with him! It was We Who did that","21:80":"It was We Who taught him the art of making metal armors for you, so you may shield yourself during battles. But then, are you grateful","21:81":"And for Sulaiman, (We tamed) the violent winds. Upon his orders they rushed towards the land We had blessed. We have the knowledge of all things","21:82":"Groups of Shaitans (those We tamed), used to sea dive for him. Besides that, they performed other duties for him. We were the guardian over them","21:83":"(And also) Ayub! He called his Lord, \"An agony has befallen me while You are absolutely the most Merciful of all who show mercy","21:84":"We heard his prayers, relieved him of his agony and reunited him with his family. We increased his family as a blessing from Us, and as an inducement for the worshippers","21:85":"And (We also heard) Ismail, Idrees and Dhul Qifl. They were all patient men","21:86":"And We admitted them into Our mercy. They were all righteous","21:87":"And remember the one (who is well known because) of the fish. He left his town in exasperation, and he thought that We would fail to take him to task. Eventually, from the darkness he called, \"There is no god but You. Exalted are You! Surely I was the offender","21:88":"We responded and relieved his grief. That is how We relieve the believers","21:89":"Zakaria called his Lord, (saying), \"Lord, do not leave me alone (child less). You are the best of those who receive the heritage","21:90":"We responded and granted him Yahya. We remedied (the condition of) his wife! All these (messengers) eagerly rushed towards the righteous acts, and prayed to Us with fear and longing. They all were humbly submissive to Us","21:91":"(As also) that lady who had guarded her virginity. We breathed Our spirit into her body, and turned her and her son into a sign for the world","21:92":"Listen! This human race of yours is really a single nation and I am your Lord, so worship Me exclusively","21:93":"But they divided up their beliefs (and devotion) amongst themselves. All must return to Us","21:94":"The efforts of anyone who performed the righteous acts _ provided he is a believer _ will not go unrecognized. Indeed, We are writing (everything) down","21:95":"And forbidden it is for the town We have destroyed to bounce back","21:96":"Until (the time), the ´Yajog´ and the ´Majog´ are let loose. They will begin to spring out from every hill","21:97":"As the promise of that certainty _ (the reckoning) _ looms closer, the eyes of the unbelievers will be glazed and agape (with horror). They will cry out, \"Oh misery to us, we stayed unmindful of this. Rather, we were the evil doers","21:98":"Indeed! You, and those you used to worship besides Allah, shall serve as fuel for the hellfire, which you shall have to enter","21:99":"Had they been gods, they would not end up here (in hell). Now, they shall stay here forever","21:100":"There, wheezing (amid moans and shrieks) shall be their mode of breathing. In hell, they shall not hear anything (else)","21:101":"But those, for whom the decree of joy and happiness had been issued by Us, will be spared the above fate","21:102":"(In paradise), they shall not hear even the faint whimper of hell. Amid what they desire and yearn, they shall live for ever","21:103":"That great anxiety will not afflict them. The angels will greet them (saying), \"Today is your day, the one you had been promised","21:104":"That day We will fold up the heavens like pages folded in a book. Then, We will begin the creation anew just as We had started it in the first instance. This is a promise incumbent upon Us. We are definitely going to fulfill (Our promise)","21:105":"We, in fact, revealed in the \"Zaboor\" _ (the book revealed to Da´ood) _ following Our warnings, that only My righteous servants shall inherit the earth","21:106":"In that, surely, is the message for the nation that prays","21:107":"We have sent you only as mercy for the entire world","21:108":"Say, \"It has been revealed to me that your God, for sure, is that One true God. So then, are you ready to submit, and obey","21:109":"If they turn their backs, say, \"I have notified you _ all of you, together. I have no idea whether that which is being promised to you, (the day of Reckoning), is close by or far in the future","21:110":"Of course, He knows that which is spoken aloud, as well as the thoughts you conceal","21:111":"I do not know. It (the respite) maybe a trial for you, or else an enjoyment for a brief while","21:112":"(Eventually), the messengers said, \"Lord! Pass Your infallible verdict! And our Lord, the Beneficent, is our Advocate against every lie you utter","22:1":"Oh you people! Fear your Lord! Indeed, the jolt of that hour (of Judgment) is a terrible thing","22:2":"On that day _ (the Day of Judgment) _ you will see every breast feeding mother oblivious of her suckling infant! Every pregnant female would abort her fetus! And people would appear to be drunk although they would not be drunk! The punishment of Allah would indeed be that severe","22:3":"Some people argue about Allah, although they have no knowledge. They tag along every defiant Shaitan","22:4":"About whom it has been decreed, that he will lead astray anyone who abides by him, and that he will steer his flock straight into the torment of hellfire","22:5":"Oh you people! Should you be in doubt about the resurrection, consider this: it is We Who created you (first) from dust and then (in stages) from semen to a clinging clot of blood, and then to a small chunk of flesh _ formed as well as unformed. (We tell you this) in order to explain to you the truth. In the womb, We keep installed whomever We want for a fixed time. Then, We bring you out as an infant, and let you obtain your full potential. Some of you die young while others are diverted to the age of weakness (and senility) _ the age when (once again) they know nothing after having learnt a few things. You observe the land dry and barren. Then, as soon as We send rain water down (it comes alive), it stirs, swells up and starts producing all sorts of delightful vegetation","22:6":"That is so because Allah is the absolute Reality! And because He grants life back to the dead! He is capable of accomplishing everything","22:7":"(Because it proves) that the hour of judgment is surely bound to come! No doubt about that! And that Allah will resurrect all (the dead) in their graves","22:8":"Some people argue about Allah, although they do not have any knowledge, guidance or an illuminating book","22:9":"Arching their necks conceitedly, they misguide people and drive them away from the path of Allah. Disgrace awaits them in this life, and on the Day of Judgment We shall have them taste the torture by fire","22:10":"This is what your own hands have wrought. Surely, Allah does not oppress His servants","22:11":"There are some people who worship Allah, but stay on the sidelines. If something good happens to them they are contented. But as soon as they are placed in a situation of trial, they undergo an about face and turn away. They lose out in this world, and also in the next! That, surely is a real loss","22:12":"Instead of Allah, they pray to such deities that can inflict no harm, and award no benefits. That is surely the worst kind of misguidance","22:13":"They pray to the one whose harm outweighs the benefits. Evil, indeed, is such a patron, and evil is such a companion","22:14":"Allah will surely admit those who believe and act righteously into paradise. Rivers run right through it. Allah does what He wills","22:15":"If anyone thinks that Allah will fail to help him (Muhammad, SAW) in this life and in the afterlife, then let that someone stretch his means to reach the heavens and traverse it. Let him see if his tricks can negate anything, including that which angers him","22:16":"Thus, We send down the revealing verses. Surely, Allah guides whomever He wants","22:17":"On the Day of the Judgment, Allah will surely settle the differences between the believers on the one hand, and the Jews, the Sabians, the Christians and the polytheists on the other. Allah is the Witness to all things","22:18":"Do you not observe that everyone (and everything) in the heavens and on the earth falls prostrate before Allah: the sun and the moon, the stars and the mountains, the trees and the beasts, and a lot of people, too! Punishment has become warranted for many others (who do not prostrate). There is no honor for the one whom Allah humiliates. Undoubtedly, Allah does what He wills","22:19":"These are the two rival groups _ (those who prostrate before Allah, and those who do not). They disagree about Allah. Garments made from fire have been readied for the unbelievers. Boiling water will be poured over their heads","22:20":"Their skins and (even) their insides will melt away","22:21":"Steel clubs shall be there (to restrain them)","22:22":"Each time they emerge to escape the distress, they will be thrown right back into it. (They will be told), \"Taste the torment of fire","22:23":"(On the other hand), Allah will surely usher into paradise _ through which run the rivers _ all those who believe and do the righteous acts. They will don gold bracelets and pearls, and their garments shall be made of silk","22:24":"They were led towards the pious speech (in this life), and towards the path of the One most Worthy of praise","22:25":"We have deemed the holy mosque (in Makkah) to be an open place. There, residents and the visitors are equal! We will reserve a painful punishment for those who disregard that (equality) and are unfair, and those unbelievers who obstruct others from the path of Allah and the holy mosque","22:26":"(Remember) We settled Ibraheem here, where the Kaaba now stands (with instructions): let there be no partners ascribed to Me in My house, and let it be rendered pure for those who perform ´Tawwaf´, and (as part of their prayer) stand, kneel and prostrate","22:27":"Call all the people for Hajj. Let them arrive on foot or mounted on lean camels. They will respond and arrive from all directions","22:28":"Let them witness the benefits (that exist) here for them, and during the specified dates let them invoke the name of Allah upon the sacrificial animals He has granted. Then, let them eat the meat and also feed the poor and the needy","22:29":"After that, let them attend to their personal needs, complete the rites (of ´Hajj´), fulfill their vows and go around the ancient house, the ´Kaaba´ _ (the rite of tawwaf)","22:30":"That was the purpose of ´Kaaba´! According to your Lord, honoring the obligations imposed by Allah is really better for you. It is allowable for you to eat the flesh of the (sacrificial) animals, except those you were informed about earlier. So, shun the filth of idolatry and steer clear of the false statement","22:31":"(Forsaking all else and) without ascribing partners to Him, be a true believer in Allah. Ascribing partners to Him is like falling from the sky and being snatched up by the birds along the way; or being carried off by a tornado to be dropped off in a remote place","22:32":"That is the reality! The sanctity for the symbols of Allah surely comes from the piety within one´s heart","22:33":"You may benefit (from the sacrificial animals) for a while but then their place of sacrifice is near the ancient house","22:34":"Different people were given different rituals of slaughtering and invoking the name of Allah upon the animals He provides. But the fact is your God is only one God, so submit (only) to Him! Give the glad news to those who surrendered to Allah´s will with humility","22:35":"Such are they that their hearts are filled with fear when reminded of Allah. They bear with fortitude every distress afflicting them, establish ´salat´ and spend in Our path out of what We have provided","22:36":"We have assigned the camels to be the ceremonial sacrificial animals for you. That is a blessing for you. Invoke Allah´s name upon them at the time of sacrifice. Then when their carcasses come to rest, eat their meat and offer it to the needy _ those who ask for it, as well as those who are reticent. This is how much We have tamed them for your sake! Perhaps you will feel grateful","22:37":"Neither their flesh nor their blood reaches Allah, but your piety reaches Him. Thus, We tamed them for you, so (at the time of sacrifice) you may glorify Allah Who gifted you these animals So give the good news to those who do good deeds","22:38":"Of course, Allah guards those who believe. Surely, Allah does not like any faithless ungrateful being","22:39":"Permission to fight back is granted to those being attacked. For they have been wronged! Allah is quite capable of helping them","22:40":"They have been driven out of their homes for no other reason except that they say, \"Allah is our Lord!\" Allah causes the fall of different people _ each by another. Otherwise, many places of worship _ like the monasteries, the temples, the churches and the mosques where Allah´s name is chanted a lot _ would be demolished. Allah will most definitely help those who help His cause. Of course, Allah is the Strongest and the most Powerful","22:41":"Those who _ if We give them power (and authority) in the land _ would establish the ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´, enjoin the good and forbid the evil! The final outcome in all matters rests with Allah´s decision","22:42":"So if they refuse to believe you, remember that prior to them, the nations of ´Samood´, ´Aads´ and Nooh also disbelieved","22:43":"As also the nation of Ibraheem and that of Loot","22:44":"So did the people of Madian. Musa, too, was accused of lying. So I granted the unbelievers a chance to redeem and reform. Finally, I grabbed them. How severe was My vengeance","22:45":"In this manner, We destroyed many towns because of their evil ways. They are (in total ruin) turned upside down on their roofs. (So are) their abandoned wells and their lofty castles","22:46":"Have they not moved about in the land? They are endowed with hearts to reason, and the ears to hear. Indeed, their eyes are not sightless. Rather, what is blind are their hearts within their chests","22:47":"They taunt you to bring on the punishment at once. Allah does not go back on His words. But as you count, a day for your Lord equals a thousand of your years","22:48":"To many a sinning towns, I granted (a respite and) an opportunity to redeem themselves. Finally, I nabbed them. Towards Me is their destination","22:49":"Say, \"Oh you people! The fact is, I am a candid warner for you","22:50":"Thus, there is forgiveness and a generous sustenance for those who believe and do righteous acts","22:51":"While those who strive to undermine Our signs (verses) will be the companions of hell","22:52":"It happened to every messenger and prophet We ever sent. Whenever they desired (and received a verse) Shaitan put his own spin (interpretation) upon it. But Allah removes whatever Shaitan casts. And then He confirms and strengthens His verses. Allah is All-knowing and All-wise","22:53":"(He does this) so that He may turn the work of Shaitan into a lure for those whose hearts are diseased and hardened. Surely, because of their malice and rancor, the evil doers (in their dissent) have strayed too far away (from the truth)","22:54":"(This happens) so that those with knowledge may recognize it to be the truth from your Lord, that they may believe it and that their hearts may acquire reverence for it. Allah certainly guides those who believe towards the straight path","22:55":"The unbelievers would keep on wrangling until the hour of judgment comes upon them suddenly, or the punishment creeps up on them on a day of disaster","22:56":"The sole authority that day shall belong to Allah! He will settle all disputes between them. (As a result) those who believe and do good deeds would be in a serene and blissful paradise","22:57":"But there will be a disgraceful torment for the unbelievers _ those who reject Our verses","22:58":"Allah will definitely grant the exquisite riches to those who emigrate for the sake of Allah, and in doing so are slain or happen to die. Indeed, it is Allah Who is the best of the providers","22:59":"Very definitely, He will admit them into the entrances (of exquisite palaces) which will delight them. Allah, indeed is the All-knowing and the Forbearing","22:60":"If anyone retaliates because he was wronged unjustly, and seeks damages proportionate to his suffering (then he is justified), and if he is wronged again, then (he will find that) Allah will definitely assist him. Allah is indeed Oft-pardoning and much Forgiving","22:61":"Because it is Allah Who wraps the night over the day, and rolls up the day over the night. Surely, Allah is All-hearing and All-seeing","22:62":"Because only Allah is the absolute truth, while all others they pray to besides Him are false. Indeed, Allah is the Loftiest, and the Greatest","22:63":"Do you not observe? When Allah sends water down from the sky the land becomes green with plants. Indeed, Allah is Well-acquanted (with everything), and the most Kind","22:64":"Everything in the heavens and on the earth belongs to Him. Indeed Allah is free from want and is the most Praise-worthy","22:65":"Do you not see? Allah has tamed everything on this earth for you. The ships sail in the sea by His command, and He withholds the sky so high, so it will not collapse upon the earth except by His will. Indeed, Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Kind","22:66":"It is He Who gave you life, and He will give you death! Then, He will bring you back to life. Man, surely, is very ungrateful","22:67":"We prescribed different rites of worship for each people. Regarding that, they really should not dispute you. Invite (them) towards the ways of your Lord. Certainly, you are well guided, and on the straight path","22:68":"But if they choose to argue, say, \"Allah is well Aware of what you are doing","22:69":"On the day of reckoning, Allah will sit in judgment and resolve every disagreement you used to have","22:70":"Are you not aware that Allah knows everything in the heavens and on the earth? That it is (recorded) in a book? And that is certainly easy for Allah","22:71":"Besides Allah, they worship others about whom they have no knowledge. He has not revealed an approval for that. There shall be no helpers for the evil doers","22:72":"As Our clear lucid verses are recited, you can see denial writ large on the faces of the disbelievers. They seem ready to pounce upon those reading Our verses to them. Say, \"Shall I tell you about a greater distress? The fire, which Allah promises for those who fail to believe, and which is a monstrous destination","22:73":"Oh you people! An example is being quoted. Listen attentively! Those you pray to besides Allah can create nothing _ not even a fly, though they may pool all their resources. (Worse than that) they are too powerless to rescue anything that even a fly might wrest away from them. Feeble are the seekers, and feeble are those being sought","22:74":"They failed to honor Allah as much as He merits to be honored. Indeed, Allah is the Mightiest, and the most Powerful","22:75":"Allah selects His messengers from among the angels as well as men. Surely, Allah is All-hearing and All-seeing","22:76":"He knows all that lies ahead of them and all that is behind them. And towards Allah are all matters directed (for decisions)","22:77":"Oh you who believe! Worship your Lord by kneeling and falling prostrate before Him; and do good deeds, so that you may prosper","22:78":"And struggle all out for Allah. For, this struggle merits an all out effort. He has chosen you and has placed no hardship in your religion, the creed of your father, Ibraheem. Not only in this (Qur´an), but in the past, too, He had named you Muslims. (He chose you) so the messengers may witness your deeds (and testify), and you may witness the deeds of the rest of the people (and testify). So establish the ´salat´ and pay the ´zakat´ and hold on to your link with Allah. He is your Master! What an excellent Master! And what an excellent Ally","23:1":"The true believers are the ones really successful","23:2":"Those who pray with humility","23:3":"And shun vulgarity","23:4":"And discharge their obligation of ´zakat´","23:5":"Those who (guard their chastity and) rein in their sexual urges","23:6":"Except with their wives and those their right hands possess. For that, they deserve no blame","23:7":"But, whoever lusts after anything beyond that is a transgressor","23:8":"(And those) who honor their pacts and the trusts (held by them)","23:9":"And those who maintain their ´salat´ watchfully","23:10":"Such (believers) will be the heirs","23:11":"They shall inherit the paradise where they shall live for ever","23:12":"Certainly, We have created man from strands of clay","23:13":"Then We made him into a drop (of sperm) lodged in an environment of stability","23:14":"Next, We turned that drop of semen into a clot of blood and then changed that clot into a chunk of flesh. Next, We hardened that chunk of flesh into bones, and clothed the bones with flesh. Finally, We converted it into an altogether different being. Therefore, glorify Allah, the Best of the creators","23:15":"Eventually, you would certainly die","23:16":"And then, you will certainly be resurrected on the Day of Judgment","23:17":"And surely, We have created seven systems (of heavens) over you. We are definitely not unmindful of the creation","23:18":"We sent down water from the sky in measured amounts, and stored it in the land. We certainly have the ability to make it run dry","23:19":"With it, We grow orchards of dates and grapes. You get plenty of fruits from the orchard as your livelihood","23:20":"(We also produce) the oil tree that grows on Mount Sinai. It yields oil and makes a delicious meal","23:21":"Indeed, there are lessons for you in your cattle, too. From their bodies We fetch you a drink (milk). You gain many benefits from them. You eat them, too","23:22":"You mount them, and go aboard ships (over land and sea)","23:23":"We surely sent Nooh towards his nation and he said, \"Oh my people! Worship Allah! You have no god besides Him. Why do you not fear Him","23:24":"But the elders, the leaders of his disbelieving nation said, \"He is just a human like you, and he seeks dominance over you. Had Allah wanted, He would have sent angels. Never have we heard this from our forefathers","23:25":"He is merely a man possessed. So just watch him for a while","23:26":"He said, \"Lord, help me against them. They have accused me of lying","23:27":"Thus, We inspired him, \"Build an ark under My supervision and instructions. When the floodwater comes bubbling out of the oven, bring on board a pair of each animal _ male and female, and also your family. But not those about whom Our word has already gone forth. Do not talk to Me about the evil doers! They shall all drown","23:28":"When you and those with you have embarked, say, \"All praise is for Allah Who saved us from the evil nation","23:29":"Say, \"Oh Lord, bring us ashore to a blessed land. You are the Best among those who lead ashore","23:30":"In it, surely, is a sign. We are the One Who puts you through tests","23:31":"After them, We raised another nation","23:32":"We raised, from amongst their own, a messenger who said, \"Worship Allah! You have no god besides Him! Why do you not fear Him","23:33":"The elders and the leaders of his disbelieving nation who denied the (scheduled) meeting of the afterlife _ and whom We had granted luxuries in this life _ said, \"He is only a man like you. He eats and drinks the same as you do","23:34":"And, you will of course be the losers if you follow a man like yourself","23:35":"Does he assert that after you die and become dust and bones you will rise (and live) again","23:36":"What you are being promised is quite far fetched! Quite remote","23:37":"Nothing but our existence in this world is real. Here is where we live and die; and we are not going to be resurrected","23:38":"This man has merely invented a lie about Allah! We do not believe him","23:39":"(The messenger) said, \"Lord, help me! They have called me a liar","23:40":"(Allah) said, \"In a short while, they shall cut a sorry figure","23:41":"Quite appropriately, a mighty blast seized them, and We churned them into trash. Thus, the nation of evildoers was dumped away","23:42":"Then, after them We raised other nations","23:43":"No nation can expedite its allotted time, nor prolong it","23:44":"Then, We sent many messengers in succession. Every nation rejected their messenger when he came to them. So, We let them follow one after the other along the path of destruction. We reduced them to fables and folk tales. Any nation that refused to believe was tossed aside","23:45":"Then, We sent Musa and his brother Haroon with Our signs, the clear and unmistakable proofs","23:46":"To the pharaoh and his chiefs! But they displayed arrogance. They were a pretentious nation","23:47":"They said, \"Shall We believe these two men _ humans like us? Their people are our slaves","23:48":"So they refused to believe (the messengers) and were destroyed","23:49":"We certainly gave Musa the book, so that they may find their way","23:50":"We deemed Jesus and his mother to be a test. We sheltered them on a plateau _ a peaceful place with a flowing stream","23:51":"Oh messengers! Eat the wholesome food and perform the righteous acts. Indeed, I am well Aware of what you do","23:52":"Surely, this nation of yours is a single nation and I am your Lord. So fear Me","23:53":"But they divided up their religion into sects _ each one well pleased with its own beliefs","23:54":"So, let them stay engrossed in their pastime for a while longer","23:55":"What do they think? That when We increase their wealth and family","23:56":"Are We rushing to bestow favors upon them? Of course not! They just don´t realize","23:57":"Indeed, those who fear their Lord with anxiety and awe","23:58":"And acknowledge the signs of their Lord","23:59":"And do not associate partners with Him","23:60":"And those who give charity _ whatever they can; their hearts tremble at the thought of returning to their Lord","23:61":"They are the ones rushing towards all deeds of excellence, and they are the ones who surpass (excellence)","23:62":"We do not burden anyone over and above his ability to bear. We have the book that declares everything truthfully. They shall not be wronged","23:63":"But their hearts reeked of indifference (for the truth) and their deeds were different (from those of the believers). They carried on with their deeds","23:64":"Until We grabbed their well-to-do (those living in luxury) with punishment. Then suddenly, they began to plead and entreat earnestly","23:65":"Today, do not beg! Indeed, you shall receive no help from Me","23:66":"My verses used to be read to you, but you used to turn your backs on them in disdain","23:67":"You were arrogant! And during your night time escapades, you used to talk ill (of Our verses)","23:68":"Did they not ponder upon the words (of Allah) at all? Did the messenger bring any thing that hadn´t ever come to their forefathers","23:69":"Or is it that they do not know the messenger and therefore they reject","23:70":"Or do they think he is mentally ill? Of course not! He has brought to them the absolute truth, but most of them have an aversion to the truth","23:71":"Had the truth been made to follow their whims, the heavens and the earth and everything thereon would be ravaged and ruined. No, We have really brought them a reminder about their own selves. But, they are turning away from the narration about themselves","23:72":"Or do you charge them a fee? The reward of your Lord is far better! He is the Best of the providers","23:73":"Certainly! You are definitely calling them towards the straight path","23:74":"And of course those who do not believe in the afterlife desire to drift away from that path","23:75":"We may have mercy upon them and remove the distress afflicting them, but obstinately they continue to rove about in defiance","23:76":"Indeed, We did grab them with distress, but they failed to surrender and adopt humility","23:77":"Until We let loose upon them the severe torment! Then suddenly, they will lose all hope and wail in despair","23:78":"It is He Who granted you the hearing, the sight and the heart (to feel and understand)! But seldom do you offer thanks","23:79":"It is He Who scattered you on the earth; and you will be gathered together in His presence (again)","23:80":"It is He Who gives life and death, and the changing of the night and the day is his (handiwork). Do you then, not understand","23:81":"But in fact, their remarks are identical to those of their forerunners _ (the unbelievers of earlier times)","23:82":"(They say) \"Really? Will we really come back to life after we die and have become dust and bones","23:83":"Of course in the past, too, the exact same promise was made to our parents and us. These are nothing but tales of people gone by","23:84":"Say, \"(Answer me this) if you know at all! To whom belongs this earth and everyone on it","23:85":"They will respond, \"Allah!\" Say, \"Then, do you not bear that in mind","23:86":"Ask them, \"Who is the Lord of the seven heavens, and who is the Lord of the Mighty Throne","23:87":"They will say, \"Allah!\" Say, \"Then, do you not fear Him","23:88":"Say, \"(Answer this), if you know at all! In whose hands is the destiny of all things? Who offers protection? And from whom there exists no escape","23:89":"They will reply, \"Allah!\" Say, \"Why then, are you being deceived","23:90":"We did disclose the truth to them! But of course, they are the liars","23:91":"Allah did not adopt a son. Nor is there another god along with Him. Else, each god would draw his creation apart and withdraw. Each would attempt to overwhelm the other. Exalted is Allah, far above what they say about Him","23:92":"He knows the unseen and the manifest. And He is a lot loftier than those they associate with Him (as partners)","23:93":"Say, \"My Lord, in case You let me be the witness to the torment they have been promised","23:94":"My Lord, do not let me be a part of the evil nation","23:95":"We are indeed perfectly capable of letting you witness the punishment with which We have threatened them","23:96":"(Oh messenger), rid the evil with that which is better! We are very well aware of what they utter","23:97":"And say, \"My Lord, I seek refuge with You against the evil promptings of the Shaitans","23:98":"And I seek refuge with You, my Lord, so that they may not even come close (to me)","23:99":"And when death comes to anyone of them, he will say, \"My Lord, send me back","23:100":"To the place I left behind! Perhaps, I will do good deeds (this time around).\" Definitely not! These are mere words he utters. A barrier behind the dead (preventing their return to this life) shall exist till the day of their resurrection","23:101":"Then, all links of kinship between them shall cease on that day. The day the trumpet sounds, they will not inquire about one another","23:102":"Those whose scales (of good deeds) weigh heavier shall be successful","23:103":"While the ones whose scales (of good deeds) weigh lighter have incurred for themselves a severe loss. In hell, they shall stay forever","23:104":"Fire will scorch their faces.

We are indeed, a blundering people","23:107":"Our Lord! Take us out of here, if we ever commit (the same) again, we would really be evil","23:108":"Allah will say, \"Enough of that! Stay in it, and do not talk to Me anymore","23:109":"Indeed, a group of Our servants used to pray, \"Our Lord, We believe! Forgive us and have mercy upon us. You are the very Best of those who shower mercy","23:110":"But you made them targets of ridicule. You mocked and scoffed at them with such intensity that it even made you forget Me (and My message)","23:111":"Today I have rewarded them for their patience and perseverance! Indeed, they are the successful ones","23:112":"Allah will ask, \"How many years did you stay on earth","23:113":"They shall reply, \"We stayed only a day or part of a day.

Flog them with eighty lashes, and thereafter do not accept their testimony ever again. Surely, they are the wicked ones","24:5":"Except those who repent after that, and reform themselves.

Do not consider it bad for yourself. Rather, it is beneficial for you! Each of them is liable for the sin to the extent of his involvement. But the greatest torment is for the one among them who assumed the major responsibility","24:12":"Why didn´t the believers _ men and women _ assume virtue for one of their own _ (a believer)? When you heard such a thing, why did you not say, \"This is quite obviously a lie","24:13":"Why did they not bring four witnesses (to back the allegations)? Since they failed to come up with the witnesses they, in the sight of Allah, are the liars","24:14":"Allah has bestowed upon you His favors and His mercy, in this world and the life-to-come. Else, a great torture would have inflicted you because of the unrestrained gossip you indulged in","24:15":"With your tongues, you spread (the lie), and with your lips you uttered that about which you had no knowledge.

This is better for you. Perhaps, you will comply","24:28":"Do not enter if you find no one at home, except when you have the (prior) permission to do so. Return if you are asked to go back.

Allah is quite familiar with what they do","24:31":"Ask the believing women to lower their gaze, guard their chastity, and not leave bare their beauty and charm, except that which becomes apparent by itself. Ask them to pull their veil-cloths down across their bosom, and not show their adornments to anyone except their husbands, fathers, husband´s father, sons, husband´s sons, brothers and their sons, sister´s sons, their women, the female slaves they own, the men-servants too old to have erotic desires, and boys not yet old enough to have awareness of the carnal. Ask them not to stamp their feet hard, in order to display (and jingle the jewelry worn on their feet and other) hidden adornments (under their outer garments). Oh you believers! Turn _ all of you _ towards Allah in repentance. Perhaps you will prosper","24:32":"And arrange for the single (but poor men and women) amongst you to marry the pious slaves and maidservants. If they are poor Allah may enrich them by His grace. Allah abounds in generosity and knowledge","24:33":"Those lacking the means to marry should abstain until Allah enriches them by His grace. Write down for your slaves _ those who desire to work for their freedom _ (the terms of emancipation) if you know them to be worthy and able. Give them something from the wealth Allah has granted you. Do not _ to gain the worldly benefits _ compel your slave girls into prostitution, while they wish to remain chaste. For the slave girl compelled in this manner, Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Kind","24:34":"We have revealed to you the clear unambiguous verses and the example of those gone by earlier, and (We have revealed) the right advice for the pious","24:35":"Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth. An example of its brilliance: there is a lamp in a luminous niche. The lamp is in a glass which itself gleams like a radiant star. It is lit by the oil of the blessed tree _ neither from the West nor the East. The oil of the lamp is ready to glow by itself even without being kindled. The bright luminous light is atop another brilliant light. Allah guides towards this light whomever He wants and Allah quotes this parable for the people. Allah is knowledgeable of all things","24:36":"Allah has favored the setting up of houses, where _ every morning and evening _ His name would be glorified and His praises chanted","24:37":"Neither trade nor sale distracts (God-fearing) men from remembering Allah, establishing ´salat´ or paying ´zakat´. They are frightened of that day when the hearts will flip and the eyes will turn (white with horror)","24:38":"So, Allah may grant them compensation consistent with the best of their deeds, and boost it further by His grace. Allah grants unlimited bounties to whomever He wants","24:39":"The deeds of the unbelievers are like a mirage in a sandy desert. The thirsty believes he sees water, but finds nothing there when he comes closer. There, he does find Allah, Who will let him have his due. Allah is very swift in reckoning","24:40":"(The condition of the unbelievers is) like darkness in the deep dark sea covered over by a huge wave, which is swarmed over by another tide. Up above are thick heavy clouds. (Total) darkness, one atop another! If one pulls out one´s hand, one could hardly see it. The one whom Allah deprives of light cannot obtain light elsewhere","24:41":"Do you not observe? Everyone in the heavens and on the earth chants the praises of Allah. The birds fly in the sky with wings spread. Each being has learnt its own prescribed form of ´salat´, and its style of singing the praises of Allah! Allah is well aware of what they do","24:42":"The domain of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah, and to Allah is the return journey (of all humans)","24:43":"Do you not observe? Allah shoves the clouds gently, and brings several of them together into a pile. Then you see raindrops falling down from it. From the mountains, He raises the hailstorm into the sky and rains it down. With it, He strikes those He wants, while He spares others. The lightning flashes (of the storm) almost blind the vision","24:44":"Allah alternates the night and the day. Surely, there is a lesson in this for those with insight","24:45":"Allah has created all creatures from water. Some creep on their bellies, some walk on two legs and some on all four.

Or do they mistrust? Do they suspect that Allah and His messenger would treat them unfairly? Of course not! In fact, it is they who are unjust","24:51":"The believers, too, are called towards Allah and His messenger, so He may settle their differences. Their outlook (in sharp contrast) is that they say, \"We hear and we obey\". Such, indeed, are the successful ones","24:52":"Those who obey Allah and His messenger, fear Allah and do their duty, are indeed the triumphant ones","24:53":"They swear so very solemnly that they would definitely leave home (and go forth into battle) if you ordered them. Say, \"Do not swear! Obedience is what is required!\" Allah is well Aware of what you do","24:54":"Say, \"Obey Allah and obey the messenger and if you turn away, then (remember that) the messenger is liable for the responsibility he bears, while you are accountable for your burden of responsibility.

He will most certainly appoint them the successors on earth, just like He appointed the people prior to you as successors. He will consolidate their way of life, much to their satisfaction. He will change their present state of insecurity and fear, into one of safety and peace. They would worship Me and would not associate anyone as My partner.

So that you may be dealt with mercifully","24:57":"Do not even doubt that the unbelievers can ever render (Allah) helpless on this earth. Fire will be their abode, which is indeed the worst of the destination","24:58":"Oh you believers, let your slaves and young pre-puberty children seek permission (to come to you) during the following three times: before the morning prayer, at around noon when you undress (for a nap), and after the night prayers. These three timings are private! At other times, there is no harm either for them or you (to come unannounced). After all, you have to move about and see each other. Thus, Allah clarifies the verses for you.

You may also eat at the homes in your possession or those belonging to your friends. There is no prohibition: you may eat alone or together. But when you enter the home, salute the people there with the noble and blessed greeting from Allah. In this manner, Allah clarifies the verses for you. Perhaps you would understand","24:62":"The real believers are those who have faith in Allah and His messenger. On a collective mission with the messenger, they do not depart without asking leave. Those who seek permission before leaving are actually the ones believing in Allah and His messenger. (Oh messenger), if they ask your leave to go, in order to attend to any of their concerns, you may allow whomever you want and ask Allah to forgive them. Indeed, Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","24:63":"Do not think that the call of the messenger is quite the same as an invitation from others amongst you. Allah is well Aware of those who _ using others as a cover _ slip away. Those who violate the commands of the messenger should beware lest a trial may inflict them, or a painful torment may come upon them","24:64":"Listen good! Everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Allah! He knows whatever course you are on. The day they are brought back to Him is when He will show them (the outcome of) their deeds.

He did not beget a son, nor does He have a partner in His domain. He created everything, and then ordained its destiny in a precise manner","25:3":"The other gods they accept besides Allah create nothing, and are themselves created. It is not within their means to harm anyone, or confer any benefits _ not even upon themselves.

My misfortune! If only I had not taken that one _ (the Shaitan) _ as a friend","25:29":"He really made me disregard the advice when it came to me.\" Indeed, the Shaitan always betrays man in times of need","25:30":"And the messenger will say, \"My Lord, truly my people had forsaken this Qur´an","25:31":"In this manner, We designated for every prophet an opponent from amongst the guilty. Your Lord suffices as a Guide and a Helper","25:32":"The unbelievers say, \"Why wasn´t this Qur´an revealed to him in a single stretch?\" This was done in order that We may fortify your heart with it. It is revealed gradually and phrased elegantly","25:33":"We responded to every objection they threw at you. We brought you the truth and the most excellent explanations","25:34":"Gathered around the hellfire and shoved into it face down, would indeed be those who held the worst of beliefs and had strayed the farthest away from the path","25:35":"We had surely granted Musa the book, and had appointed his brother Haroon as an assistant","25:36":"We said, \"Go to the people who have rejected Our signs.\" (Finally) We annihilated that nation completely","25:37":"We drowned the nation of Nooh when they rejected the messengers!

Can you then, (accept to) be in charge of his affairs","25:44":"Do you think most of them listen, or ponder? They are like animals! Nothing more! In fact, they are (worse; they are) more astray from the right path","25:45":"Do you not see how your Lord spreads out darkness? If He wanted, He could make it permanent! But He appointed the sun as a pilot (to drive away the darkness)","25:46":"Thus We gently seize (the darkness) and gradually ease it away","25:47":"It is He Who made the night don the decor that is fit for sleeping; and He made the sleep invigorating for you.

Then, send your agents to the cities","26:37":"They will summon every expert magician before you","26:38":"At the specified time on the appointed day, the magicians were summoned","26:39":"And the people were told, \"Would you, too, come to the assembly","26:40":"So that if the magicians triumph, we will follow them","26:41":"The magicians came to the pharaoh and said, \"There would surely be a reward in it for us, if we are victorious.

Very soon the oppressors will come to know the means and manners by which they will be toppled","27:1":"Ta, seen.

Those who are certain about the life-to-come","27:4":"And there are those who do not believe in the afterlife. We make their deeds seem delightful to them. So they just wander about blindly","27:5":"An evil torment is in store for such people. They are the ones who would be the losers in the afterlife","27:6":"Indeed, you are definitely receiving this Qur´an from the Wise, the Knowledgeable","27:7":"(Remember) when Musa said to his family, \"I notice a fire at a distance. I will get you some information from there, or (at least) get you a live coal so you may stay warm","27:8":"And when he got there a voice rang out, \"Blessed is the One in the fire and all around it. Exalted is Allah, the Lord of the universe","27:9":"Oh Musa! This is I, Allah, the most Powerful and the Wisest","27:10":"Throw down your stick!\" When (Musa) saw the stick wriggling about like a snake, he turned his back and ran, and did not look back. \"Oh Musa do not be afraid! Indeed, in My presence a messenger has nothing to fear","27:11":"Unless he commits an offense. Then, if he replaces the bad (deeds) with the good (deeds, he will find that) I am the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","27:12":"Put your hand in your pocket. It will come out looking white without any (stain or) pain. (Another one of) nine signs for the pharaoh and his people. Indeed, they are a wanton sinful nation","27:13":"But when Our signs reached them as clear proofs, they said, \"This is an obvious magic","27:14":"Their hearts were convinced, but they still rejected it unjustly and with arrogance. Now, see what became of the mischief mongers","27:15":"Surely, We had granted Sulaiman and Daood a (special) knowledge. Both of them remarked, \"All praise is for Allah Who excelled us over very many of His believing servants","27:16":"Sulaiman inherited from Daood and remarked, \"Oh you people, we have been imparted the (special) knowledge about the language of the birds, and we have been given all sorts of things. That is obviously a special gift","27:17":"Armies of the jinn, humans and birds were gathered for Sulaiman. They were all given proper ranks","27:18":"And as they set foot in the valley of the ants, one of the ants called out, \"Oh all you ants! Go back home to your anthills. Otherwise, Sulaiman and his armies may trample you under their feet, and they might not know it","27:19":"Amused by the ant´s remarks, Sulaiman smiled and said, \"My Lord! Keep me under control, so that (instead of being pretentious) I may remain grateful for the blessings you showered upon me and my parents. So that I may perform the righteous deeds that please You. (Lord)! by Your Grace, let me join the group of Your righteous servants","27:20":"(At another time) while inspecting a flock of birds, he said, \"What is wrong? I do not see the swan here! Is he absent","27:21":"Unless he gives me a valid reason (for his absence), I will either inflict a severe punishment on him, or just slit his throat","27:22":"The swan did not stay (absent) for long. He said, \"I have come across certain facts about which you know nothing. I bring you a reliable account from the land of Saba","27:23":"There, I found that a woman rules over them. She has been given all sorts of things, and she has a splendid throne","27:24":"I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah. Shaitan has made their deeds seem delightful to them. He alienates them from the (straight) path, so they do not find the way","27:25":"That is because they do not prostrate before Allah Who reveals the unseen mysteries of the heavens and the earth. He knows what you hide and what you reveal","27:26":"Allah! There is no god but He, the Lord of the great throne","27:27":"(Sulaiman) said, \"We will see if you told the truth or you happen to be a liar","27:28":"Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them. Then retreat, and watch what reply they give in return","27:29":"(The queen) said, \"Oh my courtiers, a noteworthy letter has been delivered to me","27:30":"It is from Sulaiman, and it begins with ´In the name of Allah, the most Merciful and the most Beneficent´","27:31":"And says that, \"You are not mightier (than me) so submit to me willingly","27:32":"The queen said, \"Oh my courtiers, give your opinion in this matter before me. I do not conclude any matter unless you are present (and unless I consult you, first)","27:33":"They said, \"We, as a nation, possess great strength and courage. But the decision is yours. Consider the situation and decide what you must","27:34":"She said, \"When the kings invade a land they undermine (its system), topple its respected and privileged class, and deem it to be despised and inferior. That is what they do","27:35":"I am going to send him a gift. I will observe the response received by my envoys","27:36":"When the envoys arrived (with their gifts), Sulaiman said, \"Do you wish to increase my wealth (and get me to postpone my invasion)? What Allah has granted me is far superior to what He gave you. No! Keep your gifts and delight in them","27:37":"Go back to them! We will surely attack them with our armies. They do not have enough power to resist. We will definitely expel them from the land, humbled and disparaged","27:38":"(Sulaiman) said, \"Oh you my courtiers, which one of you will bring me her throne before they yield and surrender to me","27:39":"One of the strong jinn said, \"I will bring it to you before you get up from your seat. I am surely reliable and strong enough for it","27:40":"The one with the knowledge of the book said, \"I will bring it to you in the blink of an eye.\" Right away, Sulaiman saw the throne placed nearby. He said, \"All this is by the grace of my Lord Who tests me to see whether I show appreciation or display arrogance. The one who offers thanks surely does so for his own good. And if someone neglects to express gratitude, then Allah is indeed Generous and Free from all want","27:41":"(Sulaiman) said, \"Disguise her throne (and casually arrange) for her (to view it). Let us see! Would she recognize (her throne)? Or is she one of those who stay ignorant of reality","27:42":"When she arrived she was asked, \"Does that look like your throne?\" She replied, \"It sure seems like the one!\" (Sulaiman observed) \"We were given the knowledge before her. We obeyed and became Muslims","27:43":"She was hindered because she used to worship those other than Allah. She belonged to an unbelieving nation","27:44":"She was invited to enter the palace. When she looked at it, she thought it was a shallow water-filled pool. So, she lifted her skirt uncovering her legs. Sulaiman said, \"This palace is really made of polished glass with water running underneath.\" She cried out, \"My Lord, I have been unjust to myself. In the company of Sulaiman, I now surrender to Allah, the Lord of the universe","27:45":"Towards the ´Samood´ We sent their brother Saleh (with instructions) to worship and obey Allah. Right away, that split them into two quarrelling groups","27:46":"(Saleh) said, \"Oh my people, why do you postpone the good, while you hasten to do evil? Why don´t you seek forgiveness from Allah? You may be granted mercy","27:47":"They said, \"We consider you and those with you as portents of evil.\" (Saleh) replied, \"Your ill omen is with Allah! In fact, you are a nation being tested","27:48":"There were nine groups of people in that town. Each one was busy spreading corruption in the land instead of carrying out reforms","27:49":"They said to each other, \"Let us swear by Allah, and be bound by the oath that: We will definitely assault him at night and (taking advantage of the surprise) put him and his family to death. Later on, we will tell his supporters that we were not present when his family was slain, and we are telling the truth","27:50":"They hatched a sly scheme! But they had no idea. We played a trick of Our own","27:51":"Look at it now! What was the outcome of their deception? We certainly destroyed them and their nation _ all of them together","27:52":"As a result of their evil deeds, these houses of theirs lie empty and in ruin. Surely, there is a sign in it for a nation with knowledge","27:53":"We rescued those who believed and were righteous","27:54":"And behold, Loot said to his people, \"Do you commit such utterly vile deeds? Even though you recognize it (to be an abomination)","27:55":"Instead of women, do you turn to men to gratify your carnal urges? Indeed, you are an utterly foolish nation","27:56":"His nation had no answer. Instead, they said, \"Drive out the family of Loot from your town. They are folk who flaunt their chastity","27:57":"But We rescued him and his family, except his wife. We decided she would be left behind","27:58":"We heaped upon them a (wrenching) rain. What an evil rain for those forewarned","27:59":"Say, \"All praise is for Allah and peace be upon His servants _ those He has picked.\" (Say), \"Who is better? Allah, or the partners you associate with Him","27:60":"Isn´t it He Who created the heavens and the earth? Doesn´t He send water down from the sky, and with it, does He not produce splendid gardens? You do not make any of its trees grow! Are there gods besides Allah? Of course not! They are a nation ascribing other beings as equal (to Allah)","27:61":"Isn´t it He who made the earth a stable place, ran rivers across its surface, caused immovable mountains to rise high and laid a barrier between the two seas? Are there gods besides Allah? Of course not! Most of them do not know","27:62":"Isn´t it He Who responds to the call of the distressed and alleviates their suffering? Isn´t it He Who lets you inherit the earth? Are there gods besides Allah? You hardly think, or heed","27:63":"Isn´t it He Who (guides and) shows you the way in the land and the sea, even when it is dark. The One Who sends winds heralding the good news of His mercy? Are there gods besides Allah? Exalted is Allah, far above all those they ascribe as His partners","27:64":"Isn´t it He Who launched the creation (the first time)? Then, He will do it all over again! Isn´t it He Who (attends to your needs and) provides from the earth (below) and from the sky (above)? Are there gods besides Allah? Say, \"Present your proof, if you are truthful","27:65":"Say, \"Absolutely no one in the heavens and on the earth knows the divine secrets, except Allah! Nobody has any idea when he (and everybody else) will be brought back to life","27:66":"The knowledge of the life-to-come has eluded them. In fact, they are skeptical of its occurrence. Rather, they are oblivious of it","27:67":"Those who have rejected say, \"Will we really come back (to life)? After we and our forefathers have turned into dust","27:68":"In the past, too, we were promised this, and so were our forefathers! These are really nothing but the tales of the earlier people","27:69":"Tell them, \"Move about in the land and observe. How (bad) did the criminals fare","27:70":"Do not feel sorry for them, and do not feel depressed over their attempts to deceive","27:71":"They say, \"If you are honest tell us, when will that promise come about","27:72":"Say, \"Some of what you seek to hasten, may just happen to you next","27:73":"Your Lord, of course, is the Lord of mercy (and He lavishly showers His favors) upon people. Yet, most of them fail to express gratitude","27:74":"Your Lord certainly knows what their hearts hold back, just as well as what they declare","27:75":"Every little secret in the heavens and on the earth is (committed to writing) in a clear record","27:76":"Surely, for the children of Israel, this Qur´an clarifies most of the issues about which they differ","27:77":"And for the believers it is certainly the guidance and the mercy","27:78":"By His verdict, your Lord will settle (all issues) between them. He is the most Powerful and the all-Knowing","27:79":"Place your trust in Allah! Of course, you are on the right track _ the plain and pristine truth","27:80":"Surely, you cannot make the dead hear anything. Nor can you get the deaf to heed your call, if they turn their backs and run away","27:81":"You cannot give directions to a blind man who has lost his way. You would only be able to tell those who believe and are ready to submit","27:82":"When the time arrives for Our prophecy to come true, We will cause a beast to emerge from the earth and address them. Indeed, people did not believe Our signs (with certainty)","27:83":"That day, from each generation We shall gather a huge crowd of those who had rejected Our signs. Then, they shall be divided into groups (according to the degree and nature of their sins)","27:84":"When all have arrived, Allah will say, \"You rejected My signs even though your knowledge consisted of nothing to the contrary? (If not) what else did you do","27:85":"Because of their evil acts the torment, as per Our word, shall befall them. At that time, they will say nothing (in their defense)","27:86":"Do they not observe? We made the night (dark) so they can rest in peace, and We made the day bright. In that, of course, are many signs for the people who believe","27:87":"All shall be terror struck on the day the trumpet sounds _ everyone in the heavens and on the earth, except those whom Allah exempts. They will all come to Him, meek and subdued","27:88":"You look at the mountains and see them fixed and motionless. But they move along swiftly, much like the passage of clouds. A handiwork of Allah! The One Who brought everything to perfection! He is certainly well Aware of what you are doing","27:89":"He who does good shall get in return a far better reward. Such a person will be secure from the horrors of that day","27:90":"Those who do evil will be tossed into the fire _ face down and head first. Could you face, as a consequence, anything other than what your deeds call for","27:91":"I have been commanded to worship only the Lord of this town (Makkah), the One Who declared it holy. Everything belongs to Him! I have been commanded to be among those who submit and are obedient","27:92":"(I have been ordered) to recite the Qur´an. Anyone who finds his way back, does so far his own good. To the one who goes astray say, \"I am in fact, just a warner","27:93":"And say, \"All praise is for Allah! Very soon, He will show you His signs, and you will recognize them, too. Your Lord is not unaware of what you do","28:1":"Ta, Seen, Meem","28:2":"These are the verses of the illuminating book","28:3":"For (the benefit of) the people who believe, We recite to you the true tale of Musa and the pharaoh","28:4":"The pharaoh claimed himself exalted in the land, dividing its inhabitants into factions. He enslaved and enfeebled one group, putting their sons to death and letting their females live. Indeed, he was wicked","28:5":"And, We wished to bestow Our favors upon those who were oppressed in the land, by granting them the leadership and having them inherit (the land)","28:6":"And We wished to consolidate them in the land and show the pharaoh, his associate Haaman, and their forces exactly what they dreaded, the very thing they took precautions against","28:7":"We sent a revelation to Musa´s mother. We said, \"Nurse him! When you fear for his life, put him in the river. Do not be afraid. Nor feel sad! We are certainly going to bring him back to you. We are going to appoint him Our messenger","28:8":"The family of pharaoh took him out of the river. (We arranged this) so he might become their enemy and a source of their grief. The pharaoh, Haaman, and their armies were habitual sinners","28:9":"The pharaoh´s wife said, \"He will be a joy for me and you! Do not put him to death! Perhaps he will bring us some benefit or we may adopt him as a son.\" They had no idea (what was to happen)","28:10":"Musa´s mother had a sense of void; her heart ached and she almost gave herself away! But We fortified her heart so she may remain a firm believer","28:11":"She said to the baby´s sister, \"Follow him!\" So, from a distance, the sister kept an eye on him. Nobody noticed her","28:12":"We had already prevented all the wet nurses from being able to feed the infant. (His sister) said, \"May I guide you to a family who would nurse and look after the baby for you? And also do it sincerely","28:13":"Thus, We brought the infant back to his mother, so that she might feel comforted and not grieve, so that she might know, for sure, that Allah´s promise is a certainty, although most people do not understand","28:14":"When Musa matured and came of age, We bestowed upon him the wisdom and the knowledge. This is how We reward those who perform good deeds","28:15":"Once when the city was slumbering, (Musa) went into town and came across two men dueling. One belonged to his group the other to the enemy. The man who belonged to his group called for help against the one who belonged to his enemy. (Thus incited), Musa struck the enemy with his fist and killed him. He (repented and) said, \"This is an act of Shaitan, who is an ardent enemy; and he misleads manifestly","28:16":"He prayed, \"I wrought a wrong against myself, my Lord! Forgive me!\" And Allah forgave him. Indeed, He is oft Forgiving, the most Merciful","28:17":"He prayed, \"My Lord, in response to your favor upon me, I shall never be an ally of the criminals","28:18":"Still apprehensive and trying to avoid trouble, Musa went into town the next morning. Suddenly, he ran into the same man who had sought his assistance a day earlier. Once again, he was calling for help (against another man). Musa responded, \"Quite clearly, you are the quarrelsome one","28:19":"Just as he was getting ready to strike the man who was their enemy, the man cried out, \"Oh Musa, do you intend to kill me like you killed a man yesterday? You only want to flaunt your strength in the land; you do not want to set things right","28:20":"From a distant town, a man came looking for Musa, and said, \"Oh Musa, the chiefs have hatched a plot to kill you. So leave town! I am really one of your well-wishers","28:21":"So, afraid and apprehensive, he left town and said, \"My Lord, save me from the oppressive people","28:22":"As he headed towards Madyan he said, \"Perhaps, my Lord would guide me on to the right path","28:23":"Musa came to the town of Madyan. Near the water supply, he found a group of men supplying their cattle with water. Close by, he found two women trying to keep their animals from drinking. Musa asked, \"What is the matter?\" They replied, \"We cannot take our turn until all other shepherds have supplied their herd. Our father is very old","28:24":"Musa took care of their animals. Then, he sat in a shade and said, \"My Lord, I am poverty struck; in (desperate) need of whatever good You may grant me","28:25":"Musa saw one of the two young women walking demurely towards him. She said, \"My father wants to see you. He wants to compensate you for taking care of our animals.\" Musa saw their father and narrated all that had happened to him (in Egypt). The man said, \"Do not be afraid. You have escaped the oppressing nation","28:26":"One of the two girls said, \"Oh father, hire him! Indeed, the best person to hire is the one who is faithful and firm","28:27":"The man said, \"I want you to marry one of my daughters, provided you work for me for eight years _ ten, if you prefer. That is up to you! I do not want to be harsh on you. Allah willing, you will find me a righteous person","28:28":"Musa said, \"So, it is settled between you and me. I shall complete one of the two terms. Beyond that, let there be no obligation upon me. Allah is the Guarantor of what we decide","28:29":"When Musa completed the term, he moved on with his family. And while traveling, (Musa) perceived a fire burning at the foot of the mountain Toor. He said to his family, \"Stay here, I see a fire! Perhaps I can bring back some news from there or a burning log to keep you warm","28:30":"When he came to the sacred site on the right side of the valley, a voice called out from a tree, \"Oh Musa, I am Allah, the Lord of the universe","28:31":"Throw down your stick!\" When he saw it wriggling like a snake, he turned away and ran, and did not glance back. \"Oh Musa, come closer! Do not be afraid! Of course, you are safe","28:32":"Stick your hand in your pocket! It will come out dazzling white without any pain (or stain). To rid yourself of fear, brace your hand to your side. These are two proofs from your Lord for the pharaoh and his chiefs. They are indeed a disobedient people","28:33":"(Musa) said, \"My Lord, I have killed one of their men. I am afraid they will kill me","28:34":"My brother, Haroon, is more fluent in speech than I am. Send him along to reinforce me. He will give credence to my claim. I am afraid they will reject me","28:35":"(Allah) said, \"We will bolster your strength with your brother, and We will grant you the power so they would be unable to hurt you. Because of Our signs, you two and those who follow you will triumph","28:36":"But when Musa brought to them Our clear signs, they said, \"This is only a trumped up magic. Such things were never heard of during the times of our forefathers","28:37":"Musa said, \"My Lord knows quite well all those who brought the guidance from Him. They would have the happy consequences in the afterlife. The wrongdoers (on the other hand) shall not prosper","28:38":"The pharaoh said, \"Oh my courtiers, I do not think you have any other god besides me. Oh Haaman, start a fire and bake clay (bricks) over it. Then build me a towering castle. Perhaps, (from atop that castle) I might be able to see the God of Musa! I really think he is a liar","28:39":"The pharaoh and his army deemed themselves great in this world; and without justification, they displayed arrogance. They thought they did not have to come back to Us","28:40":"So We grabbed him and his army, and flung them into the sea. Notice (carefully)! What was the final end of the tyrants","28:41":"We made them the leaders inviting others towards the hellfire. On the Day of Judgment, they shall receive no help","28:42":"We had a curse follow them in this life. On the Day of Judgment they will be disgraced and discredited","28:43":"After destroying the earlier generations, We gave Musa the book _ a guidance, a mercy and enlightenment for the people. Perhaps they might remember","28:44":"You were not there on the western slopes (of the mountain) where We gave Musa the commandments! You were not a witness","28:45":"After them, We raised many generations. A long time has gone by since then. You were not living in Madyan to recite Our verses to them. Rather, it is We Who really reveals these events to you","28:46":"You were not there at the side of (the mountain) Toor when We called (Musa). But this revelation is a blessing from your Lord, so you may warn your nation. Prior to you, We had not sent them a warner. Perhaps they would bear that in mind","28:47":"If a torment had hit them as a result of their own doing, they would have said, \"Our Lord, why did You not send us a messenger. We would have followed Your signs and would have been among the believers","28:48":"When the truth came to them from Us they said, \"Why wasn´t he granted a miracle of the kind conferred upon Musa. But earlier, hadn´t they rejected what Musa was given? They said, \"Both are magicians, each promoting the other","28:49":"Tell them, \"Go ahead! Present a book from Allah which has a better guidance than these two _ (the Qur´an and the Torah)! If so, if you are true to your word, follow it","28:50":"And if they do not respond. know it for sure that they are worshipping their own whims and wishes. Who can be worse than the one following his own lusts instead of the guidance of Allah. Indeed, Allah does not guide the evildoers","28:51":"We have certainly conveyed to them the word, so that they will bear in mind","28:52":"Those to whom We gave the book previously, (recognize it and) do believe it","28:53":"When it (the Qur´an) is read to them, they say, \"We believe it! It is the truth from our Lord! Indeed, even prior to this, we were the obedient ones (Muslims)","28:54":"Such believers will receive their rewards twice because they remained steadfast, strove against evil by performing good deeds and spend (for Our sake) out of the wealth granted by Us","28:55":"When they hear the silly and the obscene, they turn away and say, \"We have our deeds and you have yours. Peace be to you! We do not seek (the company of) the irrational ones","28:56":"You can not impart guidance to the one you like. Rather, it is Allah Who guides whom He wants. He is better Aware of those who follow guidance","28:57":"They say, \"If we follow your guidance, we will be swept off our land.\" Did We not render their sacred land a safe haven? As provisions by Our Grace, do We not make fruits and benefits of all kinds pour into the land? But most of them do not understand","28:58":"Many a towns have We destroyed! Their residents gloated over their (superior) way of life. Here are their houses, now! Few have lived in them since. It was We Who took over their possessions","28:59":"Your Lord would not destroy any town without first raising in its midst, a messenger and having him recite Our verses to them. He would not destroy a town unless its residents were unjust evildoers","28:60":"The possessions you have been granted are merely the provisions and adornments of the life of this world. What exists with Allah is far better and permanent. Do you not understand","28:61":"(Consider these two)! To the one We pledged excellent rewards, which he shall soon find true. We had the other enjoy the provisions of the life of this world, and on the Day of Judgment he shall be brought up (for punishment). Can one be like the other","28:62":"The day He summons them He will ask, \"Where are My partners _ those you claimed","28:63":"Those for whom the verdict is passed will say, \"Our Lord, they are the ones we misled. We led them astray, just like we lost our way. In Your presence, we wash our hands off them. They did not worship us at all","28:64":"They will be told, \"Call your partners!\" And call they will! But they shall hear no response. Instead, they will see the torment! If only they had adopted the guidance","28:65":"The day He summons them all, He will ask, \"What answer did you give to the messengers","28:66":"On that day, all explanations (and excuses) will elude them. They shall be unable to consult each other","28:67":"Except the one who repents, then believes and performs good deeds! Such a one would perhaps be successful","28:68":"Your Lord creates what He wants and selects (for His mercy whomever He wills). The choice isn´t theirs! Exalted is Allah, far above all those they ascribe as His partners","28:69":"Your Lord knows what their hearts conceal, and (not just) what they declare","28:70":"He is Allah! There is none worthy of worship except He. All praise is due Him _ here and in the hereafter! The command and control belong to Him, and to Him you shall all have to return","28:71":"Say, \"Have you ever pondered? If, till the Day of Judgment, Allah makes the night settle over you permanently, are there gods besides Allah who can fetch the light back for you? So do you not listen attentively","28:72":"Say, \"Have you ever pondered? If, till the Day of Judgment, Allah makes the day stand still constantly, is there another god besides Allah, who could fetch the night back for you, so you could rest in peace? Do you, then, not think at all","28:73":"By His grace, He has created both for you: the night so you may have rest and peace, and the day so you may seek His bounties. Perhaps you would express gratitude","28:74":"The day He summons them, He will ask, \"Where are My partners _ those you counted on","28:75":"From each generation We will bring out a witness, and We will say, \"Present your proof!\" There, they will know for sure that the absolute truth belongs to Allah. All the lies they make up will disappear","28:76":"Qaroon belonged to the people of Musa, but he turned traitor against his own people. We had granted him so many treasures. Carrying all the keys of these treasures would wear down even a band of strong men. His people said to him, \"Do not let it go to your head. Indeed, Allah does not like those who gloat and flaunt","28:77":"Seek a place in the afterlife with the wealth Allah has granted you, but of course do not neglect your share in this life. Allah has been good to you. So perform good deeds in return. Do not spread mischief in the land. Indeed, Allah does not like the one who spreads mischief","28:78":"(Qaroon) replied, \"Whatever I have been granted is because of the knowledge I possess.\" Did he not know that Allah has destroyed many in the past generations, who were better than him in strength and the abundance of wealth. The criminals are not asked about their sins (before it is time)","28:79":"He appeared among his people with great pomp and show. Those who sought and preferred the life of this world said, \"Alas! If only we had everything Qaroon has been given! He is extremely fortunate","28:80":"Those who were given (the real) knowledge said, \"Woe to you! the reward of Allah is much better for those who believe and do the righteous deeds. It is the patient ones who receive that wealth","28:81":"Finally, We made the earth swallow him up as well as his house. There wasn´t a group who could rush to help him against Allah. Nor could he help himself","28:82":"Those who longed to be in his shoes just a day earlier, began to say, \"Alas, we forgot! Allah expands and restricts the provisions of life for whomever He wants amongst His servants. Had Allah not been kind to us, He would have sunk us too! Alas, we forgot! The unbelievers will never prosper","28:83":"We will reserve the houses of the hereafter exclusively for those who do not seek self-glory in this life and do not cause oppression and corruption to spread. The final outcome belongs to those who fear (Allah)","28:84":"Those who perform good deeds shall in return receive rewards far greater in worth. Those who do evil (and vile) deeds would not be punished in excess of what their actions deserve","28:85":"The One Who ordained this Qur´an upon you would certainly bring you back to your cherished destination (the paradise). Say, \"My Lord knows much better those who have accepted guidance, and those who remained misguided","28:86":"You did not expect that the scriptures would be revealed to you. It is (nothing but) the Mercy of your Lord. So do not become a source of support to the unbelievers","28:87":"Do not ever let them deter you from (preaching) the verses of Allah after they are revealed to you. (Continue to preach) and call others towards (the way of) your Lord. Do not be among those associating partners with Allah","28:88":"Excepting Allah, do not call any one else. There is no god but He. (No one except He merits submission). Everything in this universe except His face, will perish. To Him belongs the Command, and to Him will you all be brought back","29:1":"Alif, Laam, Meem","29:2":"Are people of the opinion that once they said, ´we believe´ they would be left alone and not be put to a test","29:3":"We had certainly tested those before them. Allah definitely has to sift those who are true to their words from those who are liars","29:4":"Do those indulging in vile deeds assume that they are getting the better of Us? Utterly false is what they decide","29:5":"Those hoping to meet Allah should note that the scheduled meeting with Allah is really certain to take place. He hears everything, and knows everything","29:6":"Whoever strives, does so for his own self. Of course, Allah is (Free of want and) dependent upon no one in the world for anything","29:7":"We will mend all the shortcomings of those who believe and do good deeds. We would certainly cleanse (and rid) them of their sins, and We would grant them the best of rewards according to the deeds they performed","29:8":"We have directed man to treat his parents with compassion. But do not obey if they force you to associate partners with Me _ something you have no knowledge of! Towards Me is your final retreat. Then, I will let you know everything you have been doing","29:9":"We would certainly usher those who believe and do good deeds into the group of the righteous ones","29:10":"And among the people are those who say, ´we believe in Allah!´, but when they are bothered because of their belief in Allah they consider the suffering caused by the people to be equal to the punishment inflicted by Allah. If victory comes from Allah, they will say, \"Of course, we were with you.\" Isn´t Allah aware of whatever lies in the heart of everyone in the world","29:11":"Allah definitely knows the ones who believe, and He definitely knows the hypocrites","29:12":"The unbelievers say to the believers, \"Follow our way (of life). Let us assume your sins.\" But they are not going to take over a single one of anybody´s sins. They are most certainly lying","29:13":"They surely carry the weight of their own sins, and also that of others whom they misled. Burdens to add to their own load! On the Day of Judgment, they will most certainly be asked about the lies they used to invent","29:14":"We had sent Nooh to his people and he stayed with them for nine hundred and fifty years. Then, a storm grabbed them. They were all evil doers","29:15":"But We rescued (Nooh and) those in the ship with him. We made them a sign for the whole world","29:16":"(We had sent) Ibraheem! He said to his people, \"Worship Allah, and fear Him. That is better for you if you know","29:17":"Those others you worship besides Allah are statues. You have carved (and vested) lies (with the statues)! Indeed, those you worship instead of Allah have no power to grant you anything. Seek your provisions from Allah, obey Him and be grateful to Him. Towards Him you shall have to return","29:18":"In case you reject (remember), several other nations before you had also rejected. There is no obligation upon Our messenger except to convey the message explicitly","29:19":"Do they not observe how Allah originates the creation, and then how He renews it? Indeed, this is easy for Him","29:20":"Say, \"Move about in the land and see how He originates the creation. Allah will call the creation into existence yet another time. Indeed, Allah is capable of doing everything","29:21":"He punishes whom He wants, and He spares whom He wants. Towards Him, you all shall be turned around","29:22":"You cannot undermine (Allah) on the earth, or in the heavens. You do not have any friend or helper other than Allah","29:23":"Those refusing to believe the verses of Allah and the scheduled meeting with Him, are those who have lost hope for His mercy. There exists a painful punishment for them","29:24":"But Ibraheem´s nation had no response except to yell, \"Kill him or burn him at the stake.\" Allah, however, saved him from the fire. In that are surely signs for the believing nation","29:25":"Instead of Allah, you have accepted the idols to be the basis of your love and friendship in the life of this world. But on the day of resurrection you would repudiate each other, and you would curse each other. Hellfire will be your abode, and you will have no supporters","29:26":"Loot believed in Him and said, \"I will surely begin my journey towards Allah. He is the most Powerful and the Wisest","29:27":"We gave Ibraheem sons like Ishaq and Yaqoob, and We blessed his descendants with the prophethood and the book. We gave him his reward in this life. Surely, in the afterlife he will be amongst the righteous","29:28":"(We also sent) Loot! He said to his nation, \"Indeed, you have perpetrated an act so vile and evil that nobody prior to you had ever committed such an act in this world","29:29":"Aren´t you the ones who come to men (for sex), engage in highway robbery and perform reprehensible acts in your gatherings?\" His nation had no response except to say, \"If you are truthful, have the punishment of Allah come upon us","29:30":"He said, \"My Lord! Help me against the sinful nation","29:31":"When Our angels came and brought Ibraheem the good news (the prophecy of the two sons), they said, \"We are going to destroy the members of that community. Indeed, its residents are evil","29:32":"(Ibraheem) said, \"Loot is there!\" They replied, \"We know who is there! We are definitely going to rescue him and his family, except his wife. She is to be among those staying behind","29:33":"When Our angels came to Loot, he felt bad and became uneasy about them. They said, \"Do not be afraid, and do not grieve. We are surely going to rescue you and your family, except your wife. She is to be among those staying behind","29:34":"We are going to rain down upon the residents of this town a punishment from the sky. This is because they lead a depraved and decadent life","29:35":"We have left their traces to serve as clear signs for any nation that follows reason","29:36":"(We sent) towards the nation of Madyan, their brother, Shoaib. He said, \"Oh people, worship Allah, rely on the Day of Judgment, and do not act wickedly in this world seeking mischief","29:37":"But they rejected him! So an earthquake shook them up, leaving them (dead) _ prone and prostrate in their houses","29:38":"(And We destroyed) ´Aads´ and the ´Samoods´; their ruined dwellings are quite well known. Shaitan made their deeds appear delightful to them. Although they were endowed with reason and intellect, yet Shaitan diverted them from the (straight) path","29:39":"(And We destroyed) Qaroon, the pharaoh and Haaman. Indeed, Musa had presented them the plain proofs. But they proclaimed themselves great in the land. They could not outrun (Our punishment)","29:40":"Thus, We took all of them to task for their sins. We sent a cyclone on some of them and an overwhelming bang seized others among them. We made the ground swallow some of them and there were those amongst them whom We drowned. Allah was not cruel to them. Rather, they used to treat themselves unjustly","29:41":"Those who take patrons other than Allah (and feel secure) may be likened to a spider that spins its home. Of course the flimsiest home is the web of the spider, if only they know","29:42":"Allah really knows well whomever and whatever they pray to other than Him. He is the most Powerful and the Wisest","29:43":"We quote the examples for the people. Only those with knowledge understand them","29:44":"Allah has created the heavens and the earth with justice (and a purpose). In that is surely a sign for those who believe","29:45":"Recite the book revealed to you and establish ´salat´. Indeed the ´salat´ keeps one away from vile deeds and prohibited acts. The remembrance of Allah is greater still! Allah knows what you do","29:46":"If you argue with the people of the scriptures, do it in an amicable manner. But (do not argue) with those of them who are unjust and unfair. Say to them, \"We believe in that which is sent to us, and that which was sent to you. Our God and your God is only One, and to Him we submit (we are Muslims)","29:47":"Thus, We have revealed this book to you. (Some of) those to whom We gave the book earlier, also believe it. Among others too, are those who believe it. Only the (most ardent) unbelievers reject Our signs","29:48":"Oh messenger! Before this you never read a book. Nor did you ever write anything with your hand. Otherwise, the biased ones would have raised questions and doubts","29:49":"In fact, these are manifest proofs to (settle and satisfy) the hearts of those who were given the knowledge. Only the evil doers repudiate Our verses","29:50":"(Yet) they say, \"Why did a miracle from his Lord not come down to him.\" Say, \"Indeed, the miracles are all with Allah, I am evidently a warner","29:51":"Isn´t it enough that We revealed to you the book, which is being read to them. It is really a mercy and the right advice for the believing people","29:52":"Say, \"Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you. He knows everything in the heavens and on the earth. The losers are those who believe in absurd lies, and disbelieve Allah","29:53":"(As a taunt), they dare you to hasten the punishment! Its time is specified; else that torment would strike (right away). It will certainly come upon them suddenly (and stealthily), and they won´t even realize","29:54":"They dare you to hasten their punishment? The hellfire has certainly seized (and sealed in) the unbelievers from all sides","29:55":"On the day it strikes, the punishment will come down to wrap them from above, and will rise from under their feet (to engulf them); He will say, \"Here, taste (the result of) what you used to do","29:56":"Oh my servants who believe! Really, this earth of Mine is spacious! So worship no one but Me","29:57":"All living beings must taste death! Then, towards Us you have to return","29:58":"We will accommodate all those who believe and do the righteous deeds into the high places in paradise. Rivers run right through it. There, they will reside forever! What an excellent reward for those who act (righteously)","29:59":"Those who are patient and place their trust in their Lord","29:60":"Look at all these animals. They do not carry their sustenance with them. Allah feeds them! And He provides you, too. He hears, and He knows everything","29:61":"If you were to put them this question, \"Who created the heavens and the earth, and who tamed the sun and the moon?\", they will respond, \"Allah!\" Say, \"So why then, are you being deceived","29:62":"Allah expands the provisions _ or limits them _ for any of His servants He wants. Allah is, indeed Knowledgeable of everything","29:63":"If you were to put them this question, \"Who sent water down from the sky and revived the dead and barren land with it\", they will respond, \"Allah!\" Say, \"All praise is for Allah!\" But most of them fail to understand and ponder","29:64":"The life of this world is nothing but (a brief) play and pastime. But the house of the hereafter is surely the (real) life. Alas! If only they knew","29:65":"When they board a ship (to go overseas), they forsake all others and invoke Allah with sincerity and devotion. When He brings them safely back to land, they go back to ascribing partners to Allah","29:66":"To be ungrateful for the favors We granted them! And to immerse themselves in merriment! Very soon, they will come to know","29:67":"Do they not see that We have made this town a safe haven, while the people all around are being struck down and swept away? They believe in absurd lies, and show ingratitude for the blessings of Allah","29:68":"Who could be more wrong than the one inventing lies about Allah, or the one who calls the truth a lie, even when the truth is disclosed to him. Is there no place in hell for such unbelievers? Of course, there is","29:69":"We will surely guide on to Our path those who strive for Our sake. Allah is definitely on the side of the righteous ones","30:1":"Alif, Laam, Meem","30:2":"Romans have been defeated","30:3":"In the neighboring lands! But after being defeated they will emerge victorious","30:4":"Within ten years! To Allah belong the decision and the decree prior to this (event) and later. That day, the believers would rejoice","30:5":"Over the victory granted by Allah. He helps whom He wants. And He is the most Powerful and the most Merciful","30:6":"(It is) Allah´s promise! Allah does not go back on His words, but most people just do not know","30:7":"In the life of this world, they know only the manifest, the perceptible. They are heedless of the afterlife","30:8":"Do they not ponder about their own selves? Allah has created the heavens and the earth, and everything in between for a specific purpose and a predetermined period. But most people just fail to accept (the inevitability of) the meeting with their Lord (on the Day of Judgment)","30:9":"Have they not moved about in the land, so they could observe the fate of the people before them? They were stronger, tilled the land better and populated the earth much more than these present day unbelievers have. Their messengers brought them clear proofs! Allah was not going to oppress them, but they used to treat their own selves unjustly","30:10":"Then those doing evil fared an evil fate, because they rejected the signs of Allah and used to make fun of them","30:11":"Allah began the (process of) creation. And He will renew it! Then, you would be returned to Him","30:12":"The criminals would despair and lose all hope on the day the hour (of Judgment) is established","30:13":"They will not have the partners (they now ascribe to Allah) to plead on their behalf. (In fact), they will renounce those partners","30:14":"The day the hour (of Judgment) begins, is the day they will split into groups","30:15":"Those who believe and do good deeds will be settled in the garden of delight, and would be kept blissfully happy","30:16":"Those who disbelieved and rejected Our signs (Our verses), the (scheduled) meeting with Us, and the afterlife, will be made to stay in the torment (permanently)","30:17":"Therefore, glorify Allah when the evening approaches, and then again when it is the morning","30:18":"All praise in the heavens and the earth is for Him. (So glorify Him) prior to sunset and after noon","30:19":"He causes the living to emerge from the lifeless, and brings the lifeless out of the living. He revives the earth after its death. In that same manner you, too, will be brought out (from the dead)","30:20":"One of His signs: He created you from dust. Now here you are, humans multiplying and spreading out","30:21":"Another one of His signs: He created wives for you from amongst your kind, so you may have peace and tranquility. (No one but) He kindles love and compassion between you and your wife. Of course, there is a sign in it for any nation that ponders","30:22":"Among His signs are the creation of the heavens and the earth, the diversity of your languages and the variety of your skin color. In that are surely signs for those with (reason and) knowledge","30:23":"One of His signs is your sleep during the night and the day and your quest for his bounties (livelihood). In that are surely signs for a nation that listens (attentively)","30:24":"And He shows you one of His signs, the bolts of lightning (which you observe) with fear and hope. From the sky He sends down water, and with it He brings the land _ after it had (withered and) died _ back to life. Surely, in that are signs for any nation that understands","30:25":"Another one of His signs: the heavens and the earth stay in existence by His command! Later on, He will call you just once, and you (all) will come out of the earth instantly","30:26":"Everyone in the heavens and the earth is His servant! Each one obeys Him","30:27":"It is He Who begins the creation. And then He will renew it! That is easy for Him. The most excellent attributes in the heavens and the earth belong to Him. He is the most Powerful, and the Wisest","30:28":"He gives you an example from among you. Do you treat any of your slaves as your partners? Do you share with them equally the wealth We have granted you? Do you fear them as you would fear others like yourself? Thus, We explain Our signs for the nation that has sense","30:29":"Rather, the evil doers are following their desires without thinking. Who can guide those Allah has led astray? They will have no supporters (on the Day of Judgment)","30:30":"Therefore, forsaking all else stay firm on this religion. It suits the innate character and the very instincts with which Allah has created the human kind. Let there be no violation of the natural laws of Allah. This is the straight and true religion! But most people do not know","30:31":"(Stay firm), turning to Him in repentance! Fear Him, establish the ´salat´, and do not be among the ´mushriqeen´ _ (those associating partners with Allah)","30:32":"(Don´t be one of) those who divided their religion into many sects, each happy and contented with what it holds","30:33":"When a calamity strikes mankind, they call their Lord and turn to Him in repentance. When He lets them taste His mercy, many of them go back to ascribing partners to their Lord","30:34":"(Do they do this) to show ingratitude for everything We have granted them? Go ahead and enjoy! Soon you will find out","30:35":"Did We send them an authority that condones their acts of associating partners (with Allah)","30:36":"People are joyous when We let them taste Our mercy, but become despondent when trouble suddenly strikes them as a result of their own doings","30:37":"Do they not see? Allah increases the provisions _ or limits them _ for whomever He wants! In that are surely signs for any nation that believes","30:38":"Grant the due rights to your near ones, the poor and the wayfarer. That is better for those who seek the pleasure of Allah. They are the successful ones","30:39":"You pay interest to the people in order to increase their wealth, but it does not exceed (in value) according to Allah. Yet, the ´zakat´ you give seeking the pleasure of Allah increases manifold (in value)","30:40":"It is Allah Who created you and provided for you. Then, He will give you death, and then He will bring you back to life. Is there any among the partners (you ascribe to Allah) who does that? Glorified is He! Far above all the partners (they ascribe)","30:41":"Corruption has appeared in the land and in sea because of what people have done to themselves. Now, He will make them taste the result of some of their deeds. Perhaps they might turn back","30:42":"Say, \"Move about in the land and observe the fate of the earlier ones. Most of them were ´mushriqeens´ _ (those worship others along with Allah)","30:43":"So, keep your focus on the straight and simple religion right until that day. Its arrival will not be called off by Allah. That day people will split (into groups)","30:44":"The (punishment of) disbelief is upon the one who disbelieves. And those who do good deeds are actually clearing their way (to paradise)","30:45":"So, by His grace, He will reward those who believe and do good deeds. Indeed, He does not like the unbelievers","30:46":"One of His signs: He sends winds that carry the good news, so He may make you taste His mercy! So that, by His command the boats may sail, and you may seek His bounties. Perhaps you will express gratitude","30:47":"(Oh messenger) surely, prior to you We had sent other messengers to their people. They brought their people clear proofs. Then, We exacted revenge from those who committed sins. It is incumbent upon Us to help the believers","30:48":"It is Allah Who sends the winds, which raise the clouds. He then spreads them in the sky, as He wants. He makes (the weather) dark and downcast, and eventually you see the raindrops trickling down from the clouds. He causes rain to pour down upon such of His servants, as He wants. They feel happy","30:49":"Prior to it, they may have given up hope before the rain actually pours down","30:50":"So look at the effects of (the mercy of) Allah. (Look at) how He grants new life to the land after its death. Undoubtedly, He will bring the dead back to life. He is capable of accomplishing everything","30:51":"If We send (a special) wind and leave (their crops) pale yellow, they will (swear and curse, and) continue to disbelieve","30:52":"Of course, you cannot make the dead hear you. Nor can you make the deaf hear your call, (particularly) when they turn their backs to avoid you","30:53":"Nor can you (point out the right way and) steer the blind away from his wandering path. You can only inform and advise those who believe in Our signs and are ready to submit","30:54":"It is Allah Who created you as a frail and feeble form _ (an infant). Then He lets your weakness evolve into strength. After that, He (again) makes your strength dwindle into a state of weakness _ a senile old age! He creates whatever He wants! He is all Knowing, the Omnipotent","30:55":"The criminals will swear on the day the hour (of Judgment) is held, that they stayed (dead) for just a brief while. Thus (in their lives, too) they were deceived","30:56":"Those granted the knowledge and belief will say, \"As per the book of Allah, you have stayed till the day of resurrection, and this is the day of resurrection! But, you remained unaware","30:57":"On that day, the apologies and excuses will not benefit those who do evil. They will not even be asked to seek forgiveness","30:58":"In this Qur´an, We have explained people (the truth) in every possible way. Indeed, if you brought them a miracle they will surely say, \"You are only playing tricks on us","30:59":"Thus, Allah seals the hearts of those who stay unaware","30:60":"(So, oh messenger), stay patient (against provocation)! Allah´s promise is real! Let not those who lack faith find you soft, and short on courage","31:1":"Alif, Laam, Meem","31:2":"These are the verses of the Book of wisdom","31:3":"A guidance and mercy for the righteous","31:4":"Those who establish the ´salat´ and the ´zakat´. Those who are certain about the life-to-come","31:5":"Those are really the ones rightly guided by their Lord, and those are the successful ones","31:6":"Among men, there are some who, without any knowledge, purchase distracting tales (and trivial pursuits and pastimes) in order to lead people away from the path of Allah. They make fun of it (Qur´an). Indeed, there exists a humiliating punishment for such persons","31:7":"He turns away arrogantly when Our verses are read to him, as if he did not hear them, or as if both of his ears were afflicted with deafness. To such a one, announce the news of a painful punishment","31:8":"Of course, the bounteous paradise is for those who believe and do good deeds","31:9":"They will live in it for ever. The promise of Allah is firm, indeed. He is the most Powerful, the Wisest","31:10":"He created the heavens without any pillars you could see. He pegged the earth firmly with the mountains, lest it makes you sway and swing. He dispersed all kinds of animals on the earth. He sent water down from the sky, and raised all sorts of exotic plants in the land","31:11":"Such is the creation of Allah! Show me what others besides Him have created. Indeed, the evildoers are clearly on a misguided course","31:12":"He had certainly granted ´Luqman´ the wisdom. (He said), \"Be thankful to Allah!\". Indeed, the gratitude of the one who offers thanks is for his own good!\" And if anyone is not grateful, (let him remember that) Allah is Free of all wants and Worthy of all praise","31:13":"(Remember) Luqman said to his son by way of advice, \"Oh my son, do not associate partners with Allah. Indeed, such an act _ ´shirk´ _ is the greatest injustice","31:14":"We have made the (care of) parents incumbent upon man. His mother carried him through the fatigue (of pregnancy) followed by the hardship (of labor). And the weaning takes two (more) years. Thank Me and your parents. (Remember)! Towards Me is your return","31:15":"Yet if they, (your parents), compel you to commit ´shirk´ (associate partners) with Me _ something you have no knowledge of _ then do not obey. Deal with them in this life with kindness and courtesy, but follow the path of the one who turns to Me in repentance. Towards Me is your retreat! Then, I will relate to you what you used to do","31:16":"(Luqman said), \"Oh my son, Allah will bring out (into full view) even a tiny bit of a mustard seed, regardless of whether it happens to be in the heavens or on earth, or embedded in a rock. Indeed, Allah is the One minutely and fully Aware, and the most Elegant","31:17":"Oh my son, establish ´salat´, enjoin the good, forbid the evil (and the vile), and bear with fortitude whatever ill afflicts you. Indeed, these are the vital and quintessential commands","31:18":"Do not talk to people contemptuously, nor walk insolently on the earth. Surely, Allah does not like a haughty braggart","31:19":"Rather, be modest when you walk and keep your voice subdued when you talk. Indeed, the harshest of all voices is that of a donkey","31:20":"Do you not observe? Allah has tamed for your benefit everything in the heavens and on the earth. He has bestowed ample favors upon you _ those that are perceptible as well as those that lie hidden. Among the people there are some who argue about Allah without any knowledge, guidance or an enlightening book","31:21":"They are being asked to obey that which Allah has revealed. In response they say, \"No! We would rather practice that, upon which we found our forefathers.\" Would they still follow this practice, even if they find ´Shaitan´ inviting them towards the punishment of fire","31:22":"He who resigns and hands over his affairs to Allah _ provided he is righteous _ has indeed latched on to a secure and dependable support. The final disposition of all matters rests with Allah","31:23":"There are those who disbelieve. (But) don´t let their disbelief cause you grief. Towards Us is their return! Then, We will tell them about everything they have been doing. Indeed, Allah is (also) Aware of what lies hidden in their hearts","31:24":"We will let them enjoy for a brief while. Then, We will drag them into a severe punishment","31:25":"If you ask them, ´who created the heavens and the earth?´, they would surely respond, \"Allah!\" Say, \"Al Hamdo Lillah!\" _ (\"All praise is for Allah!\"). But most of them do not know","31:26":"To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and on the earth. Indeed, Allah is Free of all wants! And Worthy of all praise","31:27":"The discourse about Allah would not conclude even if all the trees on this earth were made into pens and the entire sea served as ink. Not even if additional ink worth seven more seas was provided as a refill. Indeed, Allah is the most Powerful and the Wisest","31:28":"The creation (of all of you) and then your resurrection, is just like (the creation and resurrection of) a single being. Indeed Allah hears all, and He sees all","31:29":"Do you not observe? Allah causes the night to take over the day, and He pushes the day over the night. He tamed the sun and the moon. Each of them is in motion for a specified term. Allah is well Aware of everything you do","31:30":"That is so, because Allah is the absolute truth, and besides Allah every one else they pray to is utterly false. Indeed, it is Allah Who is the Exalted and the Eminent","31:31":"Do you not observe? It is due to His favor, and in order to show you His signs, that the ships sail on the sea. In that are surely signs for every steadfast and grateful person","31:32":"They call Allah when (in the high seas) the waves cover them over like a canopy. (At that time) they forsake all others (and resolve) to let their religion be exclusively for Him. However, when We rescue them (and bring them) back to land, some of them compromise and fall short (of true belief). Indeed, those refuting Our signs are the swindling ungrateful cheats","31:33":"Oh you people! Fear your Lord and dread that day when a father would not make amends for (the sins of) the son, and the son would not atone for (the sins of) his father. Allah´s promise is indeed absolutely true! Do not let the life of this world dazzle you! Do not let that great deceiver (Shaitan) mislead you about Allah","31:34":"Indeed, the knowledge of the (exact) hour (of Judgment) is with Allah. It is He Who sends down the rain. He knows that which is (growing) in the wombs. No living being is aware of what it will earn the next day. No living being knows, in what land will it die. But indeed, Allah knows it all! He is aware of everything","32:1":"Alif, Laam, Meem","32:2":"The revelation of this book is from the Lord of the universe. There is no doubt about this (at all)","32:3":"Do they say he has made it all up? On the contrary, it is the absolute truth from your Lord! (It is revealed) in order to warn the nation among whom no warner had come before you. Perhaps they will find their way","32:4":"It is Allah Who, in six periods (of time), created the heavens and the earth and everything in between. Then, He mounted the throne! Besides Him, you have no partner or advocate to intercede. So then, will you bear that in mind","32:5":"He runs the affairs (of the universe) from the heavens down to earth. Then it, (the detail about all matters) rise up to Him in a day that equals a thousand years based on how you count","32:6":"Such is He, the Knower of the unseen and the manifest, absolutely the most Powerful and the Wisest","32:7":"It is He Who perfected thoroughly and excellently everything He brought into existence. The creation of man began with clay","32:8":"Then He deemed the despised fluid (semen) to be the seed of the human race","32:9":"Then He improved and refined, and breathed His spirit into man. After that, He created your ears, your eyes and your heart. Seldom do you offer thanks","32:10":"They ask, \"(After death), when we disperse and disappear into dust, will we then return in a renewed creation?\" What they refuse to believe, in fact, is the meeting with their Lord","32:11":"Say, \"The angels of death appointed over you, will take full possession of your soul. Then, you will be returned to your Lord","32:12":"Alas! If you could see the criminals _ their head bowed (in shame and grief) _ standing before their Lord, saying, \"Lord, we have seen and heard. Send us back! Now we will do good deeds. Indeed, we are now convinced","32:13":"We would have granted guidance to all living beings (individually), had We so wished! But My word has come to pass, that I will pack the hellfire with the jinn and the human kind together","32:14":"Taste (this torment). You forgot the meeting of this day, and so today, We too will forget you! Taste the permanent punishment in return for what you used to do","32:15":"In fact, the believers of Our verses are only those who, when reminded of Our verses, fall down prostrate and chant the praises of their Lord. They do not ever show arrogance","32:16":"They withdraw from their beds (at night), and stay up praying to their Lord. They spend (in charity) out of what We provide them","32:17":"No one knows the delirious delights that are kept hidden, and are meant to be the rewards for the (righteous) deeds they do","32:18":"Can the believers be like the evil doers? They are not equal","32:19":"Those who believe and do righteous deeds will get the paradise as an abode _ a bountiful treat in return for what they do","32:20":"While the fire will be the abode for those who do evil. Any time they attempt to come out of it, they will be shoved right back into it. They will be told, \"Taste this torment of the fire! This is what you had refused to believe","32:21":"Prior to that greater punishment (in the afterlife), We will also, most certainly, have them taste (many) smaller miseries (in this world). Perhaps they will come back (to their senses)","32:22":"Who could be more unjust than the one who ignores the signs of his Lord, even though they are being pointed out to him. We are certainly going to exact a revenge from such criminals","32:23":"We had (also) given Musa the book (the Torah). So, do not be in doubt about receiving this Qur´an. We made the book of Musa the guidance for the Israelites","32:24":"As long as the Israelites remained patient and believed in Our verses, We raised among them great leaders who guided them in accordance with Our instructions","32:25":"Indeed, on the Day of Judgment your Lord will settle between them the issues about which they used to quarrel","32:26":"Many towns have We destroyed prior to them. Do they not learn any lesson from that fact? They move about among those ruins. Surely, in that are signs! So why don´t they listen","32:27":"Do they not observe? We drive (rain) water towards a barren land. There, with that water We grow crops and forage _ food for their cattle, and for them, too! Don´t they ever reflect","32:28":"They ask, \"When will that decision come about? (Tell us) if you are truthful","32:29":"Say, \"Once the day of decision is already here, believing will not do the unbelievers any good. They will not be given a second chance either","32:30":"So leave them alone and wait! They, too, are waiting","33:1":"Oh prophet! Fear Allah and do not follow the unbelievers and the hypocrites. In fact, it is Allah Who knows everything, and is the Wisest","33:2":"Follow the revelation sent to you by your Lord. Indeed, Allah is well Aware of what all of you are doing","33:3":"In Allah, place your trust. Allah is sufficient as a trustee","33:4":"Allah has not placed two hearts in any person´s body. He does not render your wife to be like your mother simply because you swear and declare her to be like your mother. He does not consider your adopted sons to be like your own begotten sons. These are mere expressions that escape your lips. Allah declares the truth and guides you on to the (right) path","33:5":"Call your adopted sons by their (real) fathers´ names. That is more upright according to Allah. Should you not know their fathers, then of course, they are your brothers in faith and your companions. What you utter by mistake will not be held against you, unless you assert it consciously from the bottom of your heart. Allah is the oft Forgiving and the most Merciful","33:6":"The prophet has precedence over all believers, more than their own lives. His wives are their mothers. According to the book of Allah, the blood relatives take precedence over other believers and the ´mohajirs´ (believers who abandon their homes for the sake of Allah). But, of course, you may do your friends favors! Such is the writing in the book of decrees","33:7":"(Remember)! We have secured covenants from all messengers, including you, Nooh, Ibraheem, Musa and Jesus, the son of Mary. We have obtained from them a solid and solemn pact","33:8":"So that He may question the faithful about their truth. He has prepared a painful punishment for the unbelievers","33:9":"Oh you who believe! Remember the favors of Allah upon you, when an army had mounted an attack on you? Against them, We sent a severe storm and such armies which you could not see. Allah (watches and) is very well Aware of what you do","33:10":"(At that time), the enemy pounced on you from above and below. Your eyes turned white with fright and your hearts came pounding in your throats. You began entertaining doubts of all sorts about Allah","33:11":"In that situation the believers were really tested. They were shaken up very severely","33:12":"The hypocrites and the ones with the disease (of doubt) in their hearts began saying, \"The promises made by Allah and His messenger were just delusions","33:13":"A group of them announced, \"Oh people of ´Yathrib´ (Medina)! This is not the place to stand the attack. Turn back!\" Some of them approached the prophet seeking permission to depart. They said their homes were in danger. Their homes were not in danger. They just wanted to flee","33:14":"If the enemy had come upon them from all sides and had tempted them (to defect), they would not have resisted much. They would have betrayed you","33:15":"Earlier they had given Allah their word, that they will not turn their backs. Pledges made with Allah must be answered","33:16":"Tell them, \"You may attempt to run away from death and slaying. But such a flight will not do you much good. After that you will not be able to enjoy except for just a short while","33:17":"Say, \"Can anyone save you from Allah, if He wants to hurt you? Or (can anyone) prevent Him if He wants to grant you mercy?\" Other than Allah, they will not find for themselves a friend or a helper","33:18":"Allah surely knows those of you who stay aloof from the prevailing struggle, and say to their brothers, \"(do not fight)! Come over to us, let us go!\" They hardly participate in the battle themselves","33:19":"They are stingy with you. When danger approaches, you see them frightened. They look at you with eyes rolling in their sockets, like a man overcome by the fear of death. However, when the danger abates they return and lash out at you with their sharp (and abrasive) remarks. They are greedy for the bounties (the booties of the battle). Such are those who are not the believers. Therefore, Allah has made their deeds lose all their worth. That is really easy for Allah to do","33:20":"They think the (enemy) groups have not yet withdrawn completely. If the troops came back (to attack), they would rather like to be living among the nomadic Bedouins, keeping abreast of the news about you from afar. Even if they happened to be with you, they would hardly join the battle","33:21":"Indeed, in the messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for anyone who expects (to meet) Allah and the last day, and remembers Allah a lot","33:22":"The true believers saw the enemy troops and said, \"This is exactly what Allah and His messengers had told us. Allah and His messenger had spoken the truth!\" It rather strengthened their beliefs and heightened their zeal to accept","33:23":"Among the believers are men who have made good on their promise with Allah. Some of them have redeemed their pledges (and have been martyred), others await their turn. There has not been any change (in their determination) at all","33:24":"(Allah let it happen) so that Allah may reward the faithful for their sincerity and truthfulness; and so that He may either punish the hypocrites, or accept them back in His grace. Indeed, Allah is the oft-Forgiving and the most Merciful","33:25":"Allah drove the unbelievers back! In their fury they left without gaining any advantage. On behalf of the believers, Allah sufficed to do battle. Allah is absolutely the Strongest and the most Powerful","33:26":"Allah brought the people of the scriptures _ those who were aiding and helping the enemy _ out of their forts. He struck terror in their hearts. That is how you killed some of them and captured others","33:27":"Allah had you inhabit their lands, their houses and their riches, and the land that you had never trespassed or trampled. Allah is capable of accomplishing everything","33:28":"Oh prophet! Tell your wives, \"If you desire the life of this world and its decor, then say so. I will grant you your freedom and provide for you generously","33:29":"But if you choose Allah, His messenger and the house of the hereafter, then indeed (you should know that), Allah has prepared a great reward for the righteous amongst you","33:30":"Oh wives of the prophet! The punishment will be doubled if anyone of you commits a lewd and vile deed. That is really easy for Allah to do","33:31":"(Oh wives of the prophet) We will grant the reward twice to any of you who obeys Allah and His messenger, and acts righteously. We will grant her a generous and eminent sustenance","33:32":"Oh wives of the prophet! You are not like other women. If you fear Allah, do not speak in a soft and pleasant voice, lest someone harboring evil desires in his heart entertains evil thoughts. Be straightforward and say the right thing","33:33":"Stay put in your homes, and do not display your charms in the manner of the earlier days of ignorance. Establish the ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´ and obey Allah and His messenger. What Allah wants, is to remove all traces of filth from the family of the prophet, and cleanse and purify them really thoroughly","33:34":"And remember the verses of Allah, the pearls of wisdom, being recited in your homes. Truly, Allah is the most Elegant and the most Knowledgeable","33:35":"Allah has definitely made preparations to grant forgiveness, and to reward generously those men and women who submit (to Allah) and believe, and are obedient, patient and humble. Those who give charity, observe fasts and rigidly guard their chastity. And (above all) those men and women who remember Allah abundantly","33:36":"It is inappropriate and unbecoming of a believer _ man or woman _ to expect a choice in any matter which has already been decided and settled by Allah and His messenger. Anyone who disbelieves Allah and His messenger is clearly misguided; he has strayed far away","33:37":"And recall that man (Zayd)? Allah had done favors upon him, and you had too. You were saying to him, \"Fear Allah, keep your wife and do not divorce her.\" Allah was going to bring out into the open that which you kept hidden in your heart at that time. You were afraid of people, although that is Allah´s right! You should fear Him only! When Zayd had completed his object (of divorcing his wife), We married her to you. (We did that) so the believers may have no restriction in (and may have no stigma attached to) marrying the former wives of their adopted sons, provided the adopted sons had already divorced their wives. The commands of Allah must be fulfilled","33:38":"No restriction stands in the way of the prophet. Nothing restrains him from carrying out the orders of Allah. This happens to be the established practice of Allah in the case of all the messengers who had gone by earlier. And Allah´s command is destiny, irrevocable and predominant","33:39":"(This is true for) those who carry the message of Allah, fear Him and are not afraid of anyone except Allah. Allah is sufficient to hold the reckoning","33:40":"Muhammad (SAW), is not the father of any man among you, but he is the messenger of Allah and the last of the prophets. Allah is very well Aware of all things","33:41":"Oh you who believe! Remember Allah! Remember Him often","33:42":"Glorify and chant His praises every morning and afternoon","33:43":"It is He Who bestows His blessings upon you. His angels pray for you, that He may bring you out of darkness into light. He is very Kind and Benevolent towards the believers","33:44":"Peace\" will be their greeting on the day they meet Him. He has prepared a generous reward for them","33:45":"Oh prophet! We have sent you as a witness, as a bearer of good news and as a warner","33:46":"And as the one inviting towards the path of Allah by His will, and as a guiding illuminating lamp","33:47":"Announce the good news to the believers. They will receive a great abundance of favors and gifts from Allah","33:48":"Do not yield to the unbelievers and the hypocrites. Disregard the nuisance caused by them, and in Allah place your trust. Allah is sufficient as a trustee","33:49":"Oh you who believe! If you divorce a believing woman _ without having consummated the marriage with her _ you cannot place upon her the requirement of \"Iddat\" (waiting period of 120 days before re-marrying). So grant her the freedom and provide for her generously","33:50":"Oh prophet! We have made your wives lawful for you _ provided their agreed nuptial-dower has been paid _ and the slave women Allah has granted you. (Other women lawful for you to marry are): the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts _ those of them who migrated with you (from Makkah)_ and the believing woman who wants to enter the prophet´s household as his wife and he wants to espouse her. This (more than four wives) is an exemption especially for you, not for any other believer. We know what We have mandated for the believers concerning their wives, and the captive women. You are exempted so as to remove the difficulty you face! (The difficulty: the taboo, the culturally imposed restriction against marrying the former wives of the adopted sons, had to be broken by an actual example. It had to be done without divorcing any of the existing wives. The solution: suspend the limit of four wives for the prophet). Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful. NB: Another taboo broken by this divinely ordained marriage was the restriction against cousin marriages. The woman was the prophet´s first cousin","33:51":"You are being given the right! You may live apart from, or take up residence with whichever wife you want. And you may get back together with any of your wives you had previously estranged. You are not to be blamed. This is more likely to keep them happy, free from grief and contented with what you give them. Allah knows whatever exists in the hearts of all of you. Allah is all-Knowing, and He is the most Gentle","33:52":"After this (right) other women are not lawful for you, except the captive women. You may not bring other wives _ even though their beauty may charm you _ in place of the ones you already have. Allah watches over all things vigilantly","33:53":"Oh you who believe! Do not enter the prophet´s home, especially at mealtime, unless you have been granted permission. If you are invited to dine at the prophet´s home, arrive on time (not too early) and disperse after you have finished eating. Do not overstay and linger on in conversation. That bothers the prophet, and he is too embarrassed to tell you. But Allah is not ashamed of telling the truth! When you have to ask the wives of the prophet about anything, do so from across a screen. That is more upright, and it keeps your and their hearts more unadultrated. It is not right for you to aggravate the prophet, and it is improper for you to ever marry any of his wives after his death. Indeed that, according to Allah, is a serious offence","33:54":"Allah is Aware of every single thing, regardless of whether you express it or keep it undisclosed","33:55":"It is not improper for the ladies (and will not be held against them), if they converse freely with their fathers, their sons, their brothers and their sons, their sisters´ sons and other women _ including the slave women. Oh women! Fear Allah! Indeed, Allah observes every single thing","33:56":"Indeed Allah and His angels send their blessings upon the prophet. Oh you who believe! Send your salutes and your sincere greetings upon him","33:57":"Certainly, those who annoy Allah and the prophet (should beware); Allah has placed a curse on them in this life and in the afterlife. He has prepared for them a humialiating punishment","33:58":"Those who distress the believing men and women (by levelling false charges against them) without any reason bear the burden of having slandered a believer _ a glaring sin","33:59":"Oh prophet! Ask your wives and daughters and the women of the believers to wrap a loose outer garment completely around their bodies (leaving the face and the figure unobservable). That way they are more likely to be recognised and won´t be harassed. Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","33:60":"The hypocrites and those with a disease (of doubt) in their hearts must quit spreading false rumors in the town (Medina). Otherwise, We will most certainly rouse you into action against them. Then they will not remain your neighbors in this town much longer","33:61":"Cursed are they! Wherever found, they will be captured and killed in a carnage","33:62":"Allah has enforced this course of action for all of those gone by earlier. You will never find any departure in the established practice of Allah","33:63":"People ask you about (the exact time and date of) the hour (of Judgment). Say, \"In fact, the knowledge about that is with Allah (alone). You do not realize! That hour might just have drawn very close","33:64":"Indeed, Allah has cursed the unbelievers. He has prepared for them a blazing fire","33:65":"In it, they will live for ever. There, they will not find a friend or a helper","33:66":"That day, their faces will be roasted on (an open) fire; they will say, \"Alas, if only we had obeyed Allah, and had obeyed His messenger","33:67":"They will (further) say, \"Our Lord, we really obeyed our leaders, the influential and the distinguished among us. But they misled us and made us lose the way","33:68":"Our Lord, inflict upon them twice the punishment, and place upon them a mighty curse","33:69":"Oh you, the believers! Do not be like those who harassed Musa. Allah cleared him of what they alleged. According to Allah, he was a distinguished messenger","33:70":"Oh those of you who believe! (Always) say the right thing","33:71":"He will rectify and correct your deeds, and He will forgive your sins. Those who obey Allah and His messenger have indeed achieved the greatest success","33:72":"Indeed, We presented this trust (the Qur´an) to the sky, the earth and the mountains, to see if they would accept the responsibility that goes with it. They shied away and declined to bear it. But man assumed the obligation. Man was indeed cruel (to himself) and ignorant (of its importance)","33:73":"(Having accepted, man is liable and) Allah will punish the hypocrite men and women, and the polytheist men and women. He will forgive the believing men and women. Allah happens to be the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","34:1":"All praise is for Allah! To Him belongs everything in the heavens and on the earth. In the hereafter, too, all praise belongs to Him. He is the Wisest and the most Aware","34:2":"He knows everything that sinks into the earth, and everything that emerges from it, that which descends from the sky, and that which ascends into it. He is the most Merciful and the most Forgiving","34:3":"The unbelievers say, \"(We have rejected it flat out, yet the punishment of) the hour (of Judgment) does not strike us.\" Say, \"Of course it will! It will most certainly come upon you. I swear by my Lord Who knows the unseen intimately.\" Nothing worth even a (single) grain of sand in the heavens or on earth _ nor anything smaller or larger than that _ ever escapes His attention. Everything is (recorded) in a clear register","34:4":"(That hour will come) so that He may reward the believers _ those who perform the righteous deeds. Such are the ones, for whom there is forgiveness and a plentiful provision","34:5":"And there are those who strive to refute and repudiate Our signs. Such are the ones, for whom there exists a severely painful punishment","34:6":"Those given the knowledge understand that the revelation sent to you by your Lord is the truth. It leads on to the path of the Almighty, the most Praise worthy","34:7":"The unbelievers (ridicule and) say, \"May we show you a man who claims that after you (die and) disintegrate thoroughly into dust, you will be raised in a renewed existence","34:8":"He either lies about Allah or suffers from psychosis.\" Indeed not! Rather, those who deny the afterlife are (themselves) in a torment. They have strayed far away","34:9":"Do they not look at the sky and the earth in front of and behind them? If We want We can make the earth cave in on them, or We can drop a piece of the sky (an asteroid?) upon them. In that, is surely a sign for every repentant believer","34:10":"Indeed, We had awarded Da´ood precedence (a special gift) from Me. \"Oh you Mountains, act in harmony with him!\" (We said the same to) the birds. We made the steel malleable for him","34:11":"(We instructed him), \"Make the coat of armor from the steel, and fix its links (solidly). Perform the righteous deeds! Indeed, I observe everything you do","34:12":"And to Sulaiman (We granted control over) the wind. (Harnessing that control) he could cover the distance of a month´s journey during the run of the wind in just one morning; and come back during the course of the wind in the evening. We caused a stream of copper to gush forth for him. By the will of Allah, the jinn worked under his supervision. Whenever a jinn ignored the command and turned away from his job, We made that jinn taste the torment of the blazing fire","34:13":"The jinn worked for him and did whatever he wanted them to do. They built towering buildings (to house homeless people), carved images and icons (on the buildings), constructed large basins as reservoirs (to store water), and built huge immovable cooking pots (to feed people). Offer thanks, oh you the descendants of Da´ood! Very few of My servants express gratitude","34:14":"When We sent death upon Sulaiman, nothing could tell the jinn about his demise except the little termites gnawing away at his staff (which supported his corpse). Finally, when (the staff crumbled, and) his body fell down, the jinn came to know that they had no knowledge of the future. Else, they would not have stayed in that humiliating torment","34:15":"For the residents of ´Saba´ there was surely a proof in their (very) houses. Each house had two gardens: the one on the right and the other on the left. (We said), \"Eat the food provided by your Lord, and thank Him! (Your) land is fertile and (your) Lord is Forgiving","34:16":"But they turned away. So We (broke the dam and) flooded their land with the dam water. We converted their gardens into uncultivated plots (growing wild trees) with bitter fruits and a few scattered trees of Tamarisk and Lotus","34:17":"In this manner, We punished them for their ingratitude (and their disbelief). Do We not inflict such punishment only upon the ungrateful ones","34:18":"Along the highway connecting their towns and the town We blessed (Jerusalem), We raised many prominent communities, each not far from the other. (We said), \"Travel in the land in complete safety during the day and the night","34:19":"But they said, \"Oh our Lord, lengthen our traveling distance between our towns. They subjected themselves to unjust practices (i.e. adopted means to reverse population growth). Therefore, We turned them into tales (of people long gone). We completely disintegrated (their empire) and scattered them all around. In that, is surely a sign for every steadfast and grateful person","34:20":"In their case, ´Iblees´ certainly found his assumptions to be correct. They all followed him _ except a (small) band of believers","34:21":"He did not have any control (or authority) over them. (We let ´Iblees´ tempt people) so We may distinguish the one who believes in the afterlife from the one who remained in doubt about its existence. Your Lord is Watchful over every single thing","34:22":"Say, \"Call all those you have set up as gods besides Allah. They neither own, nor share the ownership of even an atom´s worth of anything in the heavens or the earth. Nor are any of them associates of Allah","34:23":"Mediation with Allah will benefit only those for whom He (graciously) permits mediation. When their panic eases, they will ask their mediator, \"What did your Lord say?\" The mediators will answer, \"The just verdict! He is the most Eminent, the Greatest","34:24":"Say, \"Who sends you provisions from the heavens and the earth?\" (And if they fail to answer) say, \"Allah! And only one of us is upon the true guidance. The other has clearly gone astray","34:25":"Say, \"You will not be asked about the wrongs we commit and we will not be held responsible for what you do","34:26":"Say, \"(On the Day of Judgment) our Lord will bring us together. Then He will settle all matters between us fairly and equitably. He is the all-Knowing Judge","34:27":"Say, \"Let me look at those you have installed as His partners. Not at all! Indeed, Allah (by His own right) is the most Powerful and the Wisest","34:28":"(Oh messenger) We have, in fact, appointed you as the bearer of good news, and as a warner for the entire humanity. But most people do not comprehend","34:29":"They just keep saying, \"When will that promise come about, if you are telling the truth","34:30":"Say, \"You have an appointment (with Allah) on that Day. You cannot hasten it, nor put it off _ not even for an hour","34:31":"The unbelievers said, \"We will never believe in this Qur´an, nor in the scriptures that came before it.\" (Oh Prophet), if only you could see such cruel and unjust ones standing in front of their Lord! They will hurl charges against each other. The weak and the meek will accuse those who are arrogant. \"Had it not been for you, we would be the believers","34:32":"In response, the arrogant ones will say to the weak, \"Did we hold you back from the guidance, after it had come to you? In fact, you really were guilty yourselves","34:33":"The weak will retaliate and say to the arrogant, \"No, but you played your tricks day and night. You asked us to reject Allah and appoint others as His equal.\" Both of them will try to conceal their remorse when they see the punishment right in front of them. We will place shackles on the necks of the unbelievers. They would be dealt with precisely in accordance with what their actions deserve","34:34":"Whenever We appointed a warner to a town, its affluent class said, \"We reject the message you have brought","34:35":"They said, \"We are wealthier and have more offspring than you. We are not going to face punishment","34:36":"Say, \"Of course my Lord expands _ or restricts _ His provisions for whomever He wants. But most people do not understand","34:37":"It is not your wealth or your children that confers upon you a status of honor with Us. Rather, those who believe and perform good deeds are closer to Allah. They shall have twice the reward for their deeds and they shall live in peace in the lofty mansions (of paradise)","34:38":"While those who strive to put down Our signs will be brought to face the (ultimate) torment","34:39":"Say, \"My Lord expands the provisions _ or restricts them _ for any of His servants He pleases. It is He Who compensates and replaces whatever you spend (or consume). He is absolutely the very Best of Providers","34:40":"On the day He brings them all together (in His presence), He will say to the angels, \"Was it really you they used to worship","34:41":"They will say, \"Exalted are You! You are our Patron and not they.\" In fact, they used to worship the jinn (i.e. the devil and not Us). Most of them believed (and followed) the jinn","34:42":"Today, none of you will have any power to benefit _ or harm _ anyone else.\" To those who were unjust, We shall say, \"Here, taste the torment by fire. This is what you used to refuse to believe","34:43":"When Our clear lucid verses (of the Qur´an) are recited, they say, \"He is just a man; he wants to distract you away from worshipping what your forefathers used to worship.\" They say, \"This is nothing but fantasy, a lie!\" When the (absolute) truth came to them, the unbelievers responded to it by saying, \"This is evidently nothing but magic","34:44":"Although, prior to you We did not give them a book they could study, nor did We send a warner towards them","34:45":"Those (earlier nations) long gone had also disbelieved. The present unbelievers do not possess even a tenth of (the strength, stability and the riches of) what We had given to the earlier nations. But they rejected My messengers. So, (observe) how (devastating) was My disapproval","34:46":"Say, \"I have this piece of advice for you. For the sake of Allah, give it some thought. Ponder (calmly) about this matter _ alone or with someone. There is no insanity afflicting your friend, (the messenger). In fact, he is only a warner who alerts you of a severe torment ahead of time","34:47":"Say, \"If I ever claimed a reward for myself, you may have it! My reward, in fact, is with Allah! He is the Witness over all things","34:48":"Say, \"Indeed my Lord rams the Truth (against falsehood). He knows everything there is to know about the unseen","34:49":"Say, \"The truth has arrived. So the falsehood has absolutely nothing to declare or display","34:50":"Say, \"If I err, I alone would bear its consequences. But if I am on the right path, it is because my Lord sends me the revelation. Indeed, He hears all, and He is really close at hand","34:51":"Alas, if you could only see! Stricken with panic, they will find no escape. They would be nabbed from a nearby place","34:52":"They will say, \"We do believe it (now)!\" How can they bring back (the chance for) salvation. The matter has gone too far out of hand","34:53":"Earlier on, (when they were alive) they had rejected it. They used to suppose and surmise about the unseen. (They relied on human perceptions); they were so far away","34:54":"They shall be barred from (receiving) what they like and eagerly desire _ exactly as their kind before them. They lived their lives lost in doubt and disbelief","35:1":"All praise is for Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the One Who appointed angels _ with two, three or four pairs of wings _ as His messengers. He adds to the creation as He pleases. Allah is indeed capable of doing everything","35:2":"No one can hold back whatever Allah grants mankind by His grace; and what Allah withholds, no one can release. He is the most Powerful and the Wisest","35:3":"Oh you people! Do not forget the favors of Allah upon you. Is there any creator other than Allah Who feeds you (and provides for all your needs) from the heaven and the earth? There is no god but He! Why then, are you being deceived","35:4":"(Oh prophet)! If they accuse you of lying, (remember), messengers before you had also been accused of lying. All matters are referred to Allah (for decisions)","35:5":"Oh all you people, listen! Of course the promise of Allah is absolutely true! So do not ever let the life of this world deceive you, and do not ever let the deceiver, (the Shaitan), mislead you about Allah","35:6":"Shaitan is really your enemy! So treat him as your enemy! He invites you to join his group, so you may end up being his companion in the hellfire","35:7":"There is a severely harsh punishment for those who disbelieve! For those who believe and do good deeds, there is forgiveness and a great reward","35:8":"How about the one whose bad deeds are made to appear adorable to him, so he considers them good? Allah throws on the wrong path whomever He wants, and He guides whom He wants. So do not feel sorry for them, and do not grieve. Allah is well Aware of what they do","35:9":"It is Allah Who sends the winds, then stirs the clouds into action and drives them towards the dead and barren land. Thus, after its death, We bring the land back to life! Your return to life (after your death) shall also happen in the same manner","35:10":"The one who covets (and strives for) honor and glory (should know that) the honor and might belong entirely to Allah. The worthy word of prayer ascends up to reach Him. The righteous deeds make it rise. A severe torment awaits those who devise treacherous schemes (to misguide people). The schemes of such people will come to naught","35:11":"Allah created you from dust and then from a drop of semen. Then, He fashioned you into one of two sexes _ male and female. No female ever conceives or delivers except with His precise knowledge. The aged man lives that long while the lives of others are curtailed strictly in compliance with His commands prescribed in a book. That is really easy for Allah","35:12":"The two kinds of flowing water (on the earth) are not alike. One is sweet, refreshing and quenches the thirst. The other is bitter and brackish. Yet, from both of them you attain fresh meat to eat, and extract pearls to wear. You see huge ships plough through the waves so you may seek His blessings (and earn your livelihood). Perhaps you will feel grateful","35:13":"He wraps the night over the day and He rolls out the day over the night. He has tamed the sun and the moon _ each will stay in motion for a specified period. Such is Allah, your Lord. The empire (of this entire universe) belongs to Him. Those others you call gods beside Him do not own even a flimsy film over a date-stone","35:14":"If you address your prayers to those you call gods (besides Allah), they will not hear you. They could not grant your prayers even if they heard you. On the Day of Judgment they will disown your acts of associating them with Allah. (Oh prophet)! None but the One most Aware could tell you all this","35:15":"Oh you people! You are direly in need of Allah (to exist and subsist), whereas Allah is Free of all wants and is Worthy of all praise","35:16":"If He wants, He could eliminate you completely. He could replace you with an entirely new form of life","35:17":"This is not difficult for Allah at all","35:18":"(In the afterlife), no one will bear the burden of somebody else´s (sins). The one heavily loaded (with sins) may ask others _ even his own closest relatives _ to help carry some of his load, but no one will assume even a tiny bit of his burden. In fact, (oh prophet), you can alert (only) those who fear their Lord and establish ´salat´ without having seen Him. Whoever strives to purify his soul, does so for his own good. Towards Allah is (your final) destination","35:19":"The blind and those endowed with sight are not equal","35:20":"Nor are the darkness and the light","35:21":"Nor the (cool) shade and (the sultry heat of) the sun","35:22":"The dead and the living are not equal. Of course Allah can make anyone He wants hear (anything He wants). But, you cannot make people lying in their graves hear anything","35:23":"You are only a warner","35:24":"Indeed, We have sent you with the absolute truth as a bearer of good news and as a warner. Every community that ever existed had its warner","35:25":"If they reject you (remember), they had also rejected those before you, (even though) the messengers brought them clear proofs, scriptures and the (revealing) illuminating book","35:26":"Finally, I nabbed the unbelievers; and (observe) how (devastating) was My punishment","35:27":"Do you not see? Allah sends water down from the sky, and with it We produce fruits of various kinds and diverse colors. Even the hills display streaks of varying colors: shades of white, red and jet black","35:28":"Similarly men, beasts, crawling creatures and cattle are of different colors, too. Indeed, among His servants, those with knowledge are the ones who really fear Allah. Of course! Allah is the Mightiest and the most Forgiving","35:29":"There are those who recite the book of Allah, perform ´salat´ and (for the sake of Allah) spend _ secretly as well as openly _ out of the wealth We have given them. They do so because they expect a bargain with no risk of loss","35:30":"So that Allah may grant them their reward in full, and by His grace grant them even more (than their deeds deserve). Indeed, He is the most Forgiving. And He appreciates (and rewards) gratitude","35:31":"(Oh prophet)! The book We have revealed to you is the absolute truth. It reaffirms (the truth revealed in) the earlier scriptures. Allah is certainly well informed about His servants. He watches over them","35:32":"Then, We chose others among Our servants and had them inherit the (last) book. Some among them are unjust to themselves (and refuse to accept this inheritance _ the Qur´an), and some are lukewarm in their acceptance. Others, by the grace of Allah rush towards it and excel in performing the righteous acts. That is indeed a great honor","35:33":"They will be ushered into an eternal (and idyllic) paradise where they will be offered gold bracelets and pearls to wear. Their clothes, there, would be made of (fine) silk","35:34":"And they will say, \"All praise is for Allah Who cleared away all our afflictions (and shortcomings). Our Lord is certainly the most Forgiving. He is ready to appreciate and reward gratitude (profusely)","35:35":"The One Who has given us, by His grace, this house of eternity to live. Here, we do not have to toil and struggle! Here, we do not undergo any fatigue","35:36":"There is hellfire for those who disbelieve. It will not finish them off completely. They will not die. But the torture will not be reduced (or eased). This is how We punish every (disbelieving and) ungrateful person","35:37":"There, they will cry out for help (and say), \"Our Lord, (please)) take us out of here. This time around, we will perform righteous deeds, quite different from what we did earlier!\" (They shall receive the answer), \"Did We not give you a life long enough for you to listen to (and heed) the advice, if you really wanted. A warner had come to you! Now, taste (the torment)! There is no helper for the unjust (and the cruel)","35:38":"Allah is the One Who knows all the unseen mysteries of the heavens and the earth. Indeed, He even knows that which lies hidden in the hearts (of all beings)","35:39":"Certainly, it is He Who appointed man as His deputy on earth. Thus the burden of disbelief lies solely and squarely upon those who reject. The rejection of the disbelievers only makes them ever more loathsome according to Allah. The rejection of the unbelievers, therefore, does nothing more than multiply their own loss","35:40":"Say, \"What do you think about the partners you call upon and pray to other than Allah? Show me what they have created on this earth! Or do you think they have any share in the heaven?\" Have We given them a book they can cite in support of their views? Not so at all! In fact what the evildoers assure each other are mere delusions","35:41":"Indeed it is Allah Who holds the heavens and the earth (under control), and keeps them from falling into disarray. There is no one except He, Who can hold them together, should they break loose and deviate. Of course, He is the most Forbearing, the most Forgiving","35:42":"They used to swear by Allah! They used to assert solemnly that if a warner came to them they would accept his guidance and would be better than any other nation ever. But the arrival of the warner merely increased their aversion for the truth","35:43":"They behaved haughtily in the land and devised evil plans (against Our messenger). But inevitably, the treacherous tricks boomerang and engulf the schemers. So are they waiting for the same fate that became the lot of the earlier disbelievers? They shall not find any change in Our established practice. They shall certainly not find any power capable of (intervening and) altering Our (chosen) practice","35:44":"Have they not traveled around in this world? Have they not witnessed the fateful end of those who lived earlier _ those who were much stronger (physically)? Absolutely nothing in the heavens or on the earth can render Allah helpless! Indeed, He knows everything and is Capable of doing anything","35:45":"Were Allah to punish people over every misdeed they commit, He would not have left any being alive on the surface of the earth. Instead, He prefers to postpone and grant them a respite until a specified time. Then, when the time comes, (beware)! Allah is surely Watchful over His servants","36:1":"Ya seen","36:2":"By the wisdom filled Qur´an","36:3":"Indeed, you are one of the messengers","36:4":"Upon the straight path","36:5":"This (Qur´an) is the revelation from the Mightiest, the most Merciful","36:6":"So that you may warn the people whose fore-fathers were not warned. Hence they live in ignorance","36:7":"Against most of them, the sentence is surely justified. They do not believe","36:8":"Verily, We have placed shackles around their necks that come clear up to their chins; so their heads stick out","36:9":"And We have placed a barrier in front of them, and a barrier behind them. We have also covered them over. So they see nothing","36:10":"It makes no difference to them! Warn them or not, they shall not believe","36:11":"In fact, you can only warn the one who listens to the advice and fears Rehman without having seen Him. To such a person, give the glad tidings of forgiveness and a generous reward","36:12":"Of course, it is We Who grants life back to the dead. We are recording all the deeds they send ahead, as well as all the traces they leave behind! We have preserved an account of all things in a clear and well-protected register","36:13":"Cite the example of the town, its people and the messengers who came there","36:14":"We sent two messengers towards them. They denied both of them! Then, We reinforced them with a third and they said, \"We have been appointed messengers towards you","36:15":"They replied, \"You are merely humans like us. Rehman has sent down nothing! You are just making it up","36:16":"They said, \"Our Lord knows! We really are messengers towards you","36:17":"Our responsibility is nothing more than to convey the message in clear explicit terms","36:18":"They said, \"We have really been jinxed by your presence. If you do not desist, we will surely stone you to death! You will receive a grievous torture from us","36:19":"The messengers responded, \"Is it because you are being fore-warned? You are your own jinx. In fact, you are a nation guilty of excess","36:20":"A man came running from the outskirts of the town and said, \"Oh my people! Follow the messengers","36:21":"Follow them! They are not asking anything in return. And they are well-guided","36:22":"Why not? Why should I not worship the One Who caused me to be? And towards Whom you all must return","36:23":"Shall I accept other gods besides Him? Should Rehman decide to harm me, these (false gods) could not rescue me, nor could they intervene to help a bit","36:24":"Clearly, I would then be tremendously at a disadvantage","36:25":"I have come to believe in your Lord! So listen","36:26":"(After they stoned him to death), he was told to enter paradise! The man said, \"Alas! If only my people knew","36:27":"My lord forgave me and included me among the honorable! And in return for what","36:28":"Thereafter, We did not send an army from heavens upon his people; We did not have to","36:29":"There was just a single bang, and they all were left lifeless! (As if extinguished)","36:30":"What a pity! These human kinds! Their only response to the messengers _ whenever they came to them _ was to mock and make fun of them","36:31":"Do they not observe? Many a town have We demolished prior to them. Verily, none of their dwellers ever return","36:32":"Surely! All of them together would be presented before Us (for judgment)","36:33":"And the proof for them (of the lie-to-come) is the dead land __ barren and desolate. We cause it to spring back to life! And We bring forth the grain out of it, which they eat","36:34":"We dotted the land with orchards of grapes and dates, and We caused springs to gush out of the earth","36:35":"That they may eat its produce! It was not they who made it all happen! So, should they not be grateful","36:36":"Exalted is He Who created all things in pairs! Things that grow in fields. Things within their own selves. Even things they have no knowledge of","36:37":"Another proof is the night! When We strip the day off it, they are left in the dark","36:38":"The sun proceeds towards its marked destination. This is the destiny appointed by the Mightiest and the most Knowledgeable","36:39":"And the moon! We destined it to return in stages until it comes back like the dried out branch of the date tree","36:40":"It is not ordained for the sun to overtake the moon, nor for the night to outpace the day. Each, (the sun and the moon), is afloat in its respective orbit","36:41":"Another proof for them! We surely boarded their descendants on a laden ark","36:42":"And We created other similar vessels for them to sail upon","36:43":"If We wish We could drown them, and no one would hear their whimper of protest!

He displayed arrogance, and was (always) a disbeliever","38:75":"(Allah) said, \"Oh Iblees, what kept you from falling prostrate before a being I created with My hands? Are you too proud (to bow)? Or are you one of the high and the exalted","38:76":"(Iblees) said, \"I am better than him. You created me from fire, while You created him from clay","38:77":"(Allah) said, \"Get out of here! Indeed, you are damned","38:78":"You shall carry My curse till the day of resurrection","38:79":"(Iblees) said, \"My Lord, give me a chance (to prove my point) till the day they shall be raised (back to life)","38:80":"(Allah) said, \"You are (hereby) being granted the respite","38:81":"Till the day of that appointed time","38:82":"(Iblees) said, \"I swear by Your Might, (oh Lord)! I will definitely tempt and lead all of them astray","38:83":"Except those among them that are Your true and sincere servants","38:84":"(Allah said) \"The truth is _ and (nothing but) truth I (always) speak","38:85":"That I will most certainly pack the hellfire with you and all those who follow you","38:86":"Tell them, \"I do not ask of you any compensation. I am not an imposter","38:87":"It (the Quran) really is a reminder for all the worlds","38:88":"After a while, you will certainly come to know about it yourself","39:1":"The revelation (contained) in this book emanates from Allah, the Mighty and the Wise","39:2":"Indeed, We sent you the book with the truth. So worship Allah, and keep your faith exclusively for Him","39:3":"Beware! Faith (and religion) made exclusively for Allah is His right. Those who accept patrons other than Allah say, \"We do not worship them. But they serve to bring us closer to (and let us concentrate on) Allah.\" Allah will settle all matters of dispute between people. Indeed, Allah does not guide any ungrateful liar","39:4":"If Allah (really) wanted to have a son, He could have picked anyone He wanted out of His created beings. Glory be to Him! He is Allah! The Only One, (the Compeller), the Invincible","39:5":"He created the heavens and the earth with a purpose. He makes the night succeed the day, and He has the day follow the night. He has subjected the sun and the moon (and has pressed them into service) for your sake. Each is afloat for a specified time. Is He not the most Powerful and the oft-Forgiving","39:6":"He created you (all) from a single being. Out of it, He created its spouse. He gave you eight types (four pairs: males and females of each) of domestic animals _ (sheep, goats, cows and camels). He created you in your mothers´ wombs, shaping you from one form to another _ through three (distinct kinds of) darkened zones. Such is Allah, your Lord! His is the empire (of the entire universe)! There is no god except He! How dare you turn away","39:7":"If you disbelieve (remember), Allah does not stand in need of you. (But) if you express gratitude, He is pleased with you. No one will carry the burden (of sin) for anybody else. Then, (carrying the load of your own sins) you must journey back to your Lord. He will tell you what you used to do. Indeed, He knows even that which lies (buried) in the chest","39:8":"When distress befalls man, he calls his Lord in repentance. But he forgets when his Lord (responds and) bestows His blessings _ forgets that he had ever called his Lord. To stray from the (straight) path (and to make others stray from it), he assigns partners for Allah. (Oh Muhammad, SAW) say, \"(Stay) in your denial (and) enjoy for a while. You will certainly end up in hell","39:9":"Could the one who is obedient (ever go to hell)? The one who prostrates before Allah and stands (in prayers) during all of hours of the night? The one who dreads the afterlife and hopes for the mercy of his Lord? Ask (them), \"Can those who know, be equal to the ones who do not?\" In fact, only the sensible ones heed (the advice)","39:10":"Say, \"Fear your Lord, oh servants (of Allah) who believe! The favorable outcome is for those who perform good deeds in this life. Allah´s land is spacious. Those who endure patiently would, in fact, be (compensated well and) rewarded in full without any reckoning","39:11":"Say, \"I have been ordered to worship Allah (exclusively), keeping my religion exclusively for Him","39:12":"I have been ordered to be the first to submit and surrender","39:13":"Indeed, I fear the punishment of that mighty day, in case I disobey my Lord","39:14":"Limiting my religion exclusively for Him, it is Allah Whom I worship","39:15":"You may worship others besides Him if you want.\" Say (further that), \"The worst of the losers are those who make their families _ and themselves _ suffer severe losses on the Day of Judgment. Beware! That is evidently the greatest loss","39:16":"Sheets of blazing fire will blanket them from above, and a raging fire will engulf them from below. Regarding this, Allah cautions His servants, \"Oh my servants, fear Me","39:17":"There is good news for those who shun the worship of false gods _ (the epitome of transgression) _ and turn to Allah in repentance. So let My servants hear the glad tidings","39:18":"Those who heed the advice, and implement its best features are the ones whom Allah has guided! Such are the sensible ones","39:19":"The one who deserves the sentence of the (eternal) punishment (cannot be helped). Can you rescue the one who is (as good as) in the fire","39:20":"For those who fear their Lord, there exist lofty mansions with (several) floors built one atop another, and with rivers running right through. (That is) Allah´s promise! And Allah does not back out of His promise","39:21":"Do you not see that Allah sends water down from the sky? Then, He channels it into rivers and springs across the earth, and produces with it vegetation of all different (kinds and) colors. But then it withers and you see it fade and (turn) yellow. Later, He turns it into chaff. Indeed, there is a lesson in it for any sensible person","39:22":"Allah has rendered the hearts (of some of His servants) receptive for Islam. They follow the illumilating guidance of their Lord. Can they be like the unbelievers? Misery is for those whose hearts harden up even more by the mention of Allah. They indeed are clearly on the wrong path","39:23":"Allah has revealed the very best of the narrative. The oft-repeated contents of this book are coherent, consistent and coupled _ (the promise of rewards is coupled with the threat of punishment). Those who fear their Lord are awestruck by it. Their flesh shudders with fright, and their hearts and souls become mellow with the remembrance of Allah. Such is the guidance of Allah! He guides whomever He wants! There is no guide for the one whom Allah leads astray","39:24":"So, (imagine the plight of) the one who will _ (being helpless) on the Day of Judgment _ bear the punishment right smack on his face. The evildoers would be told, \"Here, taste what you have wrought upon yourself","39:25":"The earlier people had rejected. As a result, punishment came to them from where they least expected","39:26":"Thus, Allah had them taste the shame of disgrace in the life of this world, and of course the punishment of the afterlife is much worse. If only they had realized","39:27":"Indeed, We have placed in this Qur´an various kinds of examples before the people. Perhaps, they will reflect","39:28":"The Qur´an is in Arabic; (it is simple), without any distortion or deviation. Perhaps they will fear Him","39:29":"Allah quotes an example. (There are two slaves), one belongs to many partners pitted against each other, while the other belongs entirely to one master. Can these two men fare equally? All praise is for Allah! But most people do not realize","39:30":"(Oh prophet)! Of course you will die! And for sure, they will die too","39:31":"Then, on the Day of Judgment you all would place your disputes before your Lord","39:32":"Could there be any one worse than the person who utters a lie about Allah and rejects the truth when it reaches him? For such an unbeliever, isn´t there an (appropriate) abode in the hellfire","39:33":"While those who accept the truth and believe it with sincerity are indeed the righteous ones","39:34":"With their Lord, they shall have whatever they desire. Such is the reward for the righteous","39:35":"So that Allah may pardon their bad deeds; and so that He may grant them their compensation _ reward far in excess of what their good deeds deserve","39:36":"Isn´t Allah sufficient for His servants? The unbelievers try to daunt (and discourage) you with the fear of others instead of Him. There is no guide for the one whom Allah leads astray","39:37":"(In the same manner), the one whom Allah guides cannot be thrown off track. Isn´t Allah the most Powerful _ the Lord of Retribution","39:38":"If you were to ask them, ´Who created the heavens and the earth?´, they will no doubt reply, ´Allah!´ Say, \"What do you think about those who pray to others besides Allah? Can they alleviate my distress, should Allah intend to inflict a distress upon me? Could they withhold His mercy, if Allah wanted to shower His mercy upon me?\" Say, \"Allah is enough for me! Those seeking (a trustee) should place their trust in Allah","39:39":"Say, \"Oh my people! Carry on with your practice, while I too will continue my way. Soon, you will come to know","39:40":"(You will find out) who deserves the disgraceful punishment, and upon whom lands the unshakable torment","39:41":"Indeed, We have revealed the book to you for the (good of the) people. It is the truth! Now, whoever finds the right way does so for his own good, and whoever strays harms himself. (Oh prophet)! You are not (appointed) a manager over them","39:42":"At the time of death, Allah takes full possession of the soul of the deceased, and also the souls of those who are asleep and not dead. He then holds back those for whom He has decreed death. He sends back the souls of others for an appointed time. In that, indeed, is a sign for a nation that ponders","39:43":"Or have they, instead of Allah, accepted mediators (to worship)? Ask them, \"Even though they have no power, and may understand nothing","39:44":"Say, \"All mediation and intervention belongs to Allah exclusively! To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth! You will be sent back to Him","39:45":"Those who do not believe in the afterlife are saddened when only Allah´s name is mentioned in their presence. Their hearts shrink in disgust. But they suddenly become joyous when others beside Allah are mentioned","39:46":"Say, \"Oh Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the Knower of the unseen and the manifest! You will settle disputes between Your servants _ the disputes they are arguing about now","39:47":"On the Day of Judgment, the evildoers would offer as a ransom their entire wealth in exchange for exemption from the terrible punishment, even if they owned everything in this world, and that much more to go with it. (The punishment) from Allah would then become apparent to them. They never imagined (its severity)","39:48":"The evil of the actions they had committed would then become apparent to them. That, which they used to mock would overwhelm them","39:49":"When the distress afflicts man, he prays to Us (for relief). But once We grant him Our blessings, he says, \"In fact, I have been granted all this because of my (superior) knowledge.\" Of course not! Rather, it is a test for him! But most of them do not know","39:50":"The (people who lived) before their time had said the very same things. But their achievements, the deeds (and wealth) they earned, were of no use to them","39:51":"Thus, the evil deeds they had gathered brought them down. The same is true for these (present day) evildoers. The evil deeds they accumulate will soon strike them down. They cannot render (Allah) helpless","39:52":"Do they not know? Allah increases the provisions _ or restricts them _ for whomever He wants. Indeed, in that is certainly a sign for any believing nation","39:53":"(Oh prophet)! Declare, \"Oh my servants! Oh you who have overly and unduly burdened yourself (with sins)! Do not abandon hope in the mercy of Allah. Of course Allah pardons all sins! Indeed He is the most Forgiving; and the most Merciful","39:54":"Turn to your Lord in repentance, and submit to Him before the punishment comes upon you. Lest (it is too late and) you cannot be helped","39:55":"Follow the excellent advice revealed to you by your Lord before the time (arrives) when the punishment will creep up on you stealthily and you would not realize","39:56":"Then the (evil) person would say, \"Oh pity on me! Concerning Allah I was too neglectful (and I went too far). I was among those who used to mock","39:57":"Then he will say, \"I would have been a God-fearing person, had Allah guided me","39:58":"As he witnesses the (oncoming) punishment, he would wail, \"Oh! If I had a second chance, I would be righteous","39:59":"No! In fact My signs (and guidance) did come to you! And you did reject them. You displayed arrogance. You were the disbeliever","39:60":"On the Day of Judgment, you will see! The faces of those who invented lies about Allah would be tainted and tarnished. Isn´t there a place in hell for the proud and the haughty","39:61":"Allah will rescue those who fear the effect (of their actions). Nothing bad will happen to them. They shall not feel sorry","39:62":"Allah is the Creator of everything, and He is the Guardian over everything","39:63":"He has the keys to (the treasures of) the heavens and the earth. Indeed the losers are those who reject the signs of Allah","39:64":"Say, \"Are you then asking me to worship beings other than Allah? You ignorant fools","39:65":"It has been revealed to you just as it had been revealed to those before you, that if you commit ´shirk´ (associate partners with Allah) your (good) deeds would surely come to naught, and you would definitely be the losers","39:66":"Instead, worship Allah (exclusively) and be grateful","39:67":"They did not appreciate or revere Allah as He rightfully deserves to be appreciated. On the Day of Judgment this earth would be (held nipped) in His fist, and the heavens would lie folded across His right (forearm). Exalted is He! Far above everything they associate and affiliate with Him","39:68":"Then, as the trumpet sounds, all (living beings) in the heavens and on earth would fall unconscious _ except whomever Allah wishes to keep alive. Then, the trumpet will blare for the second time and at once, everyone would stand alert, looking around","39:69":"The light emanating from the Lord will flood the earth, (brighten it up) and make it glitter. The book (of deeds) will be placed (in evidence). The prophets and (other) witnesses would be at hand (to testify). The matter would be settled with justice. No one would be wronged at all","39:70":"Everyone will be compensated in full for (every) action they (ever) did; He is well Aware of what they do","39:71":"Successive groups of unbelievers would be dispatched to hell. As the gates of hell open, the keepers (of hell) would ask, \"Had the messengers from amongst your own (people) not come to (warn) you? Didn´t they recite to you the verses of your Lord, warning you about the encounters of this day?\" They will reply, \"Yes (they did)!\" The sentence of torment is (fair and) justified for the unbelievers","39:72":"They would be ordered to enter the gates of hell and live there till eternity. Evil is the abode for the arrogant","39:73":"(In sharp contrast), the successive groups of those who (believed and) feared their Lord would be ushered into paradise. As its gates open, its keepers would greet them saying, \"Peace be with you! Well done! Enter the paradise to live there till eternity","39:74":"They would explain, \"All praise is for Allah Who redeemed His promise (made) to us, and He gave us this land to inherit. (Now) we can settle down anywhere we want in paradise. What an excellent reward for the doers (of good)","39:75":"You will see the angels gathered around the throne (of Allah) chanting the praises of their Lord. All matters between people would be decided (and disposed of) with justice. The declaration will resound, \"All praise is for Allah, the Sustainer of the universe","40:1":"Ha! Meem","40:2":"The revelation of this book (the Qur´an), is Allah, the Powerful and the Knowledgeable","40:3":"(He is the sole authority) to pardon the sins and to accept repentance! (He is) the stern and stringent Punisher, and the Lord and Master of (unbridled absolute) might. There is no god but He! Towards Him is the (final) destination","40:4":"Except the unbelievers, no one disputes the signs of Allah. But do not let their exploits and activities in this world ever deceive you","40:5":"Earlier, the people of Nooh and other groups after them, had rejected the truth. Every nation pounced on the messengers (of Allah), and attempted to quarrel with them by unfair and foul means. (They tried) to refute and undermine the truth by such means. (At last) I nabbed them. So (observe) how (severe) was My punishment","40:6":"Thus, concerning the unbelievers, the words of your Lord prevailed and came to pass. They are the companions of hellfire","40:7":"Those (angels) carrying His throne, and others present nearby, (incessantly) sing the praises of their Lord. They believe in Him and they seek His forgiveness for (all) those who believe in Him. They say, \"Oh our Lord, You control and dominate everything with knowledge and mercy. Forgive those who turn to You in repentance and follow Your (straight) path. Save them from the torment of hellfire","40:8":"Oh Lord, usher the righteous ones, their parents, mates and offspring into paradise _ the paradise of Eden You have promised them. You are certainly the Powerful and the Wisest","40:9":"(Oh Lord)! Save them from the evil (outcome)! The one spared the evil (outcome) that day (would be successful) because of Your mercy upon him. That, in fact is the greatest (possible) success","40:10":"(On the Day of Judgment) the unbelievers would be informed, \"Surely at this time you hate yourself. But earlier (in the previous life) Allah´s hatred for you was far greater, because you refused when you were invited to believe","40:11":"They will say, \"Our Lord, twice You gave us death and twice You brought us back to life! Now, we confess our sins, (oh Lord), is there any option (still open to us) to evade (the torment)","40:12":"(They will be told) \"You deserve this plight because when Allah, the One and the Only, was being worshipped, you turned away in disbelief. But you (readily) accepted when partners were set up with Him. Now the decision rests solely with Allah, the Exalted and the Greatest","40:13":"It is He, Who shows you His signs and sends down the provisions for you from the sky. Only the one who turns in repentance (to Allah) heeds the advice","40:14":"So call Allah and keep your faith exclusive for Him, even if the unbelievers dislike and detest","40:15":"The One Who is of the highest status, the Owner of the (Exalted) throne, (Allah), sends the spirit carrying His message to any of His servants He wants. So that His servant may sound the alarm about the day of the meeting (with the Lord)","40:16":"That day, (everything about) everyone would be fully exposed. Nothing about them is (ever) hidden from Allah.

There shall be no injustice today. Allah is very swift in reckoning","40:18":"Warn them about the day that creeps closer. The day when the heart will leap up to the throat and throttle it. The evildoers shall not have any protectors, or an acceptable mediator","40:19":"Allah knows even the surreptitious and deceitful glance of the eye, as well as the secrets buried deep within the chest","40:20":"Allah decides and concludes everything with justice. Those others they pray to beside Him, decide (absolutely) nothing. Allah is certainly the One Who hears and sees (all)","40:21":"Have they not moved about in the land? Did they not observe the fate of those (who had lived) before them? They were stronger and left more enduring monuments (and influences) on the earth. But Allah grabbed them for their sins and there was no one to protect them from Allah","40:22":"That is so because the messengers brought them clear proofs and they still rejected. Finally Allah seized them! Indeed, He is very Strong and Severe in punishment","40:23":"We had certainly sent Musa with Our signs, and the manifest proofs","40:24":"Towards the pharaoh, Haaman and Qaroon! But they said, \"(He is) a magician! A liar","40:25":"When he brought to them the truth from Us, they said, \"Kill the sons of those who believe in Musa, and let their daughters live.\" But the evil tricks of the unbelievers always go awry","40:26":"And the pharaoh said, \"Let me kill Musa. Let him call his Lord (to rescue him). I am really afraid that he might change your way of life, or he might spread unrest in the country","40:27":"Musa responded, \"I have sought refuge with my Lord and your Lord from every haughty person who does not believe in the day of reckoning","40:28":"A man from the nation of pharaoh, who was a believer and was hiding his faith, said, \"Would you kill a man just because he asserts that Allah is his Lord? He has brought you clear proofs from your Lord! Should he be a liar, let his lie be upon his conscience. But if he happens to be truthful, then you might suffer from some of the things with which he has threatened you! Indeed, Allah does not guide a liar and a transgressor","40:29":"Oh people, today the empire belongs to you and it is the dominant power in the world! But who will help us if the wrath of Allah comes down upon us?\" The pharaoh said, \"I only express what I think. I guide you along the path of reason (and logic)","40:30":"The one who had believed said, \"(Oh my) people! I am really afraid that you might encounter (the same fate) as did the people of earlier times","40:31":"The kind of fate that befell the nations of Nooh, ´Aads´, ´Samoods´ and others after them.

In a frantic frenzy, you would call each other (for help)","40:33":"That day you would turn your backs and flee (in desperation). You shall have no one to protect you from Allah. Indeed, there is no guide for the one whom Allah misguides","40:34":"Earlier, Yusuf had brought you obvious proofs, but you remained skeptical about what he brought you. When he died you claimed that Allah would never raise another messenger after him. This is how Allah leads the transgressors and the skeptics astray","40:35":"Those who bicker about the verses of Allah without a valid reason or without any revelation having come to them! According to Allah, as well as those who believe, such an act is very disgusting. This is how Allah places a seal upon the heart of every arrogant and bullying person","40:36":"The pharaoh said, \"Oh Haaman, build me a lofty tower so I may attain the (right) means","40:37":"The means to (reach) the heaven, so I may look at Musa´s God! But I really think he, (Musa), is just lying.\" Thus the wickedness of pharoah´s action was made to appear adorable to him, and he was prevented from the (straight) path. The tricks of the pharaoh merely led him to his ruin","40:38":"The one who had believed said, \"Oh my people! Follow me. Let me guide you along the (sensible) virtuous path","40:39":"Oh my people, the life of this world is in fact a brief and transient enjoyment. While the afterlife is certainly the place of permanence","40:40":"The punishment of the one who does evil would only be equal to _ (and would not exceed) _ the nature (and the severity) of his sin. On the other hand, the men and women who perform the righteous deeds _ provided they are the believers _ would surely be the ones entering paradise. They would be granted abundant (infinite and endless) bounties without reckoning","40:41":"Oh my people, how (strange) is it, that I call you towards salvation but you respond by inviting me towards the hellfire","40:42":"You are asking me to reject Allah and set up partners with Him. I know nothing about (any partners)! The One I call you towards, (Allah), is the most Powerful and the most Forgiving","40:43":"No doubt at all! The one you are calling me towards, (Shaitan), in fact has no authority _ neither in this world, nor in the afterlife! Our return is surely towards Allah, and the transgressors are surely the companions of the fire","40:44":"Soon you will recall what I am telling you now. I entrust my affairs to Allah. Indeed, Allah watches over His servants","40:45":"So, Allah protected that believer from the evil schemes they hatched (against him). Instead, a treacherous torture engulfed the pharaoh (and his followers)","40:46":"Now, every morning and every evening they are brought before the fire; (and that will continue unabated) until the day the hour of judgment takes place. (Then, the order would be), \"Throw the pharaoh and his people into an even worse torture","40:47":"And (imagine) when they would argue with each other in the hellfire.

So, too, (We would help them) on the day the witnesses take stand","40:52":"That day, the excuses (and apologies) of the evildoers would not benefit them at all. A curse would be (placed) upon them, and theirs would be the most abhorrent abode","40:53":"We had surely granted Musa the guidance, and We made the Israelites inherit the book","40:54":"Which was the guidance and advice for those with sense and intelligence","40:55":"So, (be sure and) remain patient. The promise of your Lord is really true! Ask for your sins to be pardoned; and sing the praises of your Lord (every) morning and evening","40:56":"Indeed those who argue about the verses of Allah _ concerning which no revelation (or knowledge) has come to them _ have nothing but pride (and images of self-grandeur) in their heart.

Allah is surely very Gracious (and Benevolent) for the people. Yet, most people are (just) not grateful","40:62":"Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of every (single) thing! There is no god but He! Why then are you (letting yourself be) hoodwinked","40:63":"Those rejecting the signs (and verses) of Allah had also been deceived the same way","40:64":"It is Allah Who arranged for this earth to be your (temporary) abode, and the sky to be the dome over you.

After that, they would be hurled into the hellfire","40:73":"Then they would be asked, \"Where are those (gods) you used to worship","40:74":"Instead of Allah?\" They will reply, \"They have all ceased to exist _ vanished! Actually, earlier, we never really prayed to anything at all.\" In this manner, Allah lets the unbelievers go astray","40:75":"(You suffer this plight) because you used to rejoice in the (affairs of the) world without any right (or reason), and because you used to gloat and exult (about falsehood)","40:76":"(Now) enter the gates of hell and live there forever. What an abominable abode for the proud and the haughty","40:77":"So be patient (Oh Muhammad, SAW), Allah´s promise is the absolute truth. We might let you watch them undergo some of the punishment We have promised them. Or else, We might first (recall you and) give you death. After all, towards Us they all have to return","40:78":"Indeed, We sent (many) messengers before you. We have narrated to you the tales of some of them, and We have told you nothing about the others. Without the permission of Allah (and of his own accord) no messenger could ever perform any miracles. (In the case of all the messengers), once the order came from Allah, the matter was settled with total justice. Those insisting upon falsehood incurred a total loss at that time","40:79":"Allah it is, Who created the cattle so you may ride them, or eat their flesh","40:80":"You obtain many benefits from them. You also fulfill with them some of the other needs you have in mind (e.g. transporting goods). Mounted on them and aboard ships, you are transported (across land and sea)","40:81":"He points out to you (so many of) His signs. How many signs of Allah will you deny","40:82":"Have they not moved about in the land? Do they not see the fate of the people who lived before them? They were stronger and more in number. They have left their traces and vestiges in the land. What they earned (in this life) did not help them at all","40:83":"Even though the messengers brought them clear proofs, yet they remained (smugly) pleased and contented with the (deficient) knowledge they possessed. Finally the torment they used to mock and ridicule, actually did surround them completely","40:84":"Then, as they eyed the punishment they cried out, \"We (now) believe in Allah, the One and the Only, and we reject everything (and everyone) we used to associate with Him","40:85":"But their belief conferred no benefits upon them at all, (because they accepted only) after having witnessed Our (power and) punishment. (Such is) the established practice of Allah. It has always been in effect for all His servants. At that time, the unbelievers suffered a (total) loss","41:1":"Ha! Meem","41:2":"This is a communiqué from the most Merciful and the most Kind","41:3":"A book whose verses are distinct and described in detail. The Qur´an is (revealed) in the Arabic language for the people who know (Arabic)","41:4":"It bears the good news and also warns. But most of them turn away. They (just) do not listen","41:5":"They, (the unbelievers) say, \"Our hearts are sheathed, immune from being affected by anything you might say. Our ears are deaf to your call. There is a barrier between you and us, and it sets us apart. So, do as you please and we will do as we please","41:6":"Say, \"In fact, I am a human being like you. It has been revealed to me that your god is only One God! So, seek the path (that leads) straight to Him, and seek His forgiveness. Misery is for those who associate partners (with Allah)","41:7":"Those who do not pay the ´zakat´! Those who deny the life to come","41:8":"And the never-ending infinite rewards exist for those who believe, and do the righteous deeds","41:9":"Say, \"Do you dare to disbelieve in the One Who created the earth in two periods of time? Do you dare to set up others as His equal? It is the Lord of the universe (you have dared to disobey)","41:10":"He firmly fixed mountains on the earth, that rise high above its surface, and He blessed the earth. He made arrangements to supply the nourishment needs (for all life forms ever to exist on the earth) in four periods of time. Without exception, (He apportions food) to all who ask for it","41:11":"(Then) He turned to the heaven. It was then (just) smoke. To it and the earth, He said, \"Willing or not, eager or averse, (you are being ordered to) come into being!\" They replied, \"We come willingly","41:12":"Then He concluded the creation and organized (the smoke) into seven heavens in two periods of time, and revealed to each its duties and responsibilities. We adorned the heaven of this world with luminary bodies, and We secured them. This is the destiny appointed by the Mightiest and the most Knowledgeable","41:13":"But if they turn away then say, \"I (hereby) warn you about (an overwhelming punishment by) the lightning and thunder, the kind that struck down the people of ´Aads´ and ´Samood´","41:14":"The messengers came to them (and told them what lay) ahead of them as well as behind them, and instructed them to worship no one except Allah. But they said, \"Had our Lord wanted this, He would have sent us angels (to preach). We (hereby) reject that which (you claim) has been revealed to you","41:15":"Just like the people of ´Aads´! Without any reason or right, they conducted themselves arrogantly in this world. They said, \"Does anyone excel over us in strength and power?\" Could they not see that Allah Who created them, is certainly far superior to them in strength? They used to refute Our signs","41:16":"So, in a matter of a few ill-fated days, We devastated them with cold and frigid winds that shrieked past them. Thus, We made them taste a disgraceful punishment in the life of this world. And the punishment of the afterlife is worse, and far more humiliating. They will not be helped","41:17":"As for the ´Samood´, We showed them the way, but they preferred to remain blind about the guidance. Therefore, because of what they used to commit, a humiliating punishment of lightning bolts grabbed them","41:18":"But We saved those who believed, and used to ward off (evil)","41:19":"And (warn them of) the day when the enemies of Allah would be rounded up, (and forced on) towards the hellfire. They would be impelled (and shoved) onwards","41:20":"Before they reach the hellfire, their ears, their eyes and their skin would (begin to talk and) bear witness against them, regarding everything they used to do (in this world)","41:21":"They will ask their skin, \"Why did you testify against us?\" (Their skin) would retort, \"Allah granted us (the faculty of) speech, the same One Who gives everything the ability to talk. He it is, Who created you the first time, and now you are brought back to Him","41:22":"When you used to cover up and conceal your evil deeds, (you never considered) that your ears, your eyes and your skin would testify against you. In fact, you thought that (if you hide your deeds) Allah would not find out much of what you do","41:23":"Such notions you had about your Lord! And they actually brought about your fall. You became the losers","41:24":"(It does not matter) even if you bear your punishment patiently. The hellfire would be your abode! And if you seek to atone and make amends, you would not be excused","41:25":"(In the life of this world), We assigned them friends who made their past and the present _that which was behind them as well as that which was before them _ seem glamorous to them. Thus the verdict became justified for all the generations that had lived prior to them, all the jinn and the human kind. Indeed, they were all losers","41:26":"The unbelievers say to each other, \"Do not listen to this Qur´an, and during its recital create a disturbance. (That way), perhaps you would dominate (the scene)","41:27":"We would definitely make the unbelievers taste a severe punishment. We would certainly inflict upon them a punishment equal to the deeds they used to commit","41:28":"The punishment for the enemies of Allah is the hellfire. In it will be their abode till eternity! A (warranted) punishment because they used to deny (Our signs and) Our revelations","41:29":"The unbelievers will say, \"Our Lord, let us see those among the jinn and the humans who (deceived us and) led us astray. We will place them under our feet and trample them, so as to utterly disgrace and degrade them","41:30":"Indeed, angels come down to (befriend) those who say, \"Allah is our Lord\" and then stay steadfast on it. (To them the angels say), \"Have no fear, and do not grieve. (Rather), rejoice! (We bring you) the good news of paradise which you had been promised","41:31":"We are your friends in the life of this world, as well as in the afterlife. There, you shall have anything your heart desires. There, whatever you ask for will be yours","41:32":"A reception (and divine hospitality) from the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","41:33":"Nobody´s assertions could be better (and more trustworthy) than the words of a person who invites others towards (the worship of) Allah, acts righteously and says, \"Indeed, I am among those who surrender and submit (to Allah)","41:34":"The good and the bad deeds are not alike. Respond to their bad deeds with good ones, and you will find that the person who was hostile and antagonistic towards you has turned into a bosom buddy","41:35":"Such an attribute _(a stage of perfection) _ is granted only to those who stay steadfast. Those are the most fortunate","41:36":"If the prompting of Shaitan stirs you, seek refuge with Allah. Of course, He hears all and knows all","41:37":"The night and the day, and the sun and the moon are among His signs. Do not bow before the sun, or before the moon. Rather, prostrate before Allah, the One Who created them, if it is He Whom you want to worship (exclusively)","41:38":"The unbelievers may turn away (from the truth) arrogantly, but those (angels) close to your Lord glorify Him (and chant His praises) day and night. They do not relent","41:39":"One of His signs: you see the land dry and desolate. But it suddenly stirs and quivers, and begins to bear (vegetation) just as soon as He sends down the rain upon it. The One Who gives life to the dead land is surely going to bring the dead back to life. Indeed, He is Capable of doing everything","41:40":"Those who twist and distort Our verses are, of course, not unknown to Us. So then, who will fare better on the Day of Judgment? The one flung in the hellfire? Or the one who arrives safe and secure (into paradise)? Do what you want. Of course, He watches (and knows) whatever you do","41:41":"These people have refused to accept the advice, (the Qur´an), when it came to them, (though) it is definitely a mighty book","41:42":"Falsehood can neither confront it head on, nor approach it (stealthily) from behind. (It is) a revelation from the Wise, the One Worthy of praise","41:43":"(Oh Muhammad, SAW)! Nothing has been said to you that had not been said to the messengers before you. Indeed, your Lord is (not only) the Lord of forgiveness, (but also) the Lord of the painful punishment","41:44":"Had We revealed (this Qur´an) in a non-Arabic language, they would have said, \"Why are its verses not clear and understandable? What? A non-Arabic (discourse) and an Arabic (audience)?\" Say to them, \"For those who believe, this Qur´an is a guidance and a cure (for spiritual ailments). While, it is a plug for the ears and a blindfold for the eyes of those who do not believe. (It is, as if) they (barely) hear being summoned from a far off place","41:45":"We had granted Musa the book; it, (too), was (questioned and) disputed. But your Lord´s word has already been decreed. Had it not been for that, their dispute would have been decided (and settled) once and for all. They remained hopelessly in doubt about it (the book)","41:46":"Whoever acts righteously does so for his own sake, and whoever commits evil does himself a bad deed. Your Lord is not unjust to His servants","41:47":"The knowledge of the hour (of Judgment) is held back by Him. No fruit ever blooms from its bud, and no female ever (conceives and) carries to term except with His knowledge (and permission). On that day (of Judgment), the unbelievers would be asked, \"(Now), where are those partners you attributed to Me?\" They will reply, \"We have confessed before You. None of us can bear witness (about them)","41:48":"All the (gods) they used to invoke and pray to would get away from them (and vanish); and they would get the idea that there exists no refuge (on that day)","41:49":"Man never tires of praying for the good (things in life), and becomes dejected and despondent when something bad afflicts him","41:50":"Indeed, after letting him go through unhappy times, if We let him taste Our blessings (and bounties), he begins to say, \"This is (all) mine (because I deserve it). I do not think the hour of judgment would ever be brought into being. But if (per chance) I am sent back to my Lord, nothing but good (things) would await me there from Him.\" We would certainly relate to them everything they are (now) doing. We would definitely make them taste the worst of the punishment","41:51":"When We bestow Our favors upon man, he drifts afar and distances himself (from Us); but when hardship afflicts, he prays (and pleads) long and hard","41:52":"Say, \"How would you feel if the Qur´an really happens to be from Allah, and yet you reject it? Can anyone be more wrong than the one who has strayed too far (in his hatred)","41:53":"Soon, We will show them Our signs in the universe, and even in their own bodies, until it becomes amply clear to them that, indeed, this (Qur´an) is the truth. Is it not enough for you that your Lord (watches and) witnesses every single thing","41:54":"Beware! In reality they are skeptical about meeting their Lord. Beware, He has contained and hemmed in every single thing","42:1":"Ha, Meem","42:2":"Ain, Seen, Qaf","42:3":"Thus, Allah the most Powerful and the Wisest, sent revelation to you as well as to those before you","42:4":"Whatever is in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him; He is the most Eminent and the most Exalted","42:5":"The heavens are on the verge of splitting apart. The angels chant the praises of their Lord; they pray and seek forgiveness for those (living) on earth. Isn´t it Allah (alone) Who is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","42:6":"Allah is the Guard (and the Warden) over those who accept others besides Him as protectors. You are in no way responsible for them","42:7":"We revealed to you this Qur´an in the Arabic language, so you may alert the people of Makkah and the neighboring communities, so that you may warn them about the day of assembly. About that day there is no doubt! One group will be in paradise, and the other in the hellfire","42:8":"Had Allah wanted, He could have created all of them as a single community. But He (selects and) admits to His mercy whomever He wants. The wrongdoers shall not have any protectors or helpers","42:9":"Beside Him, have they accepted others as their Lord, although it is Allah (alone) Who is the Master? He gives life to the dead, and He is capable of doing everything","42:10":"It is for Allah to (clarify and) resolve all matters concerning which you have differences (of opinion). Such is Allah, my Lord! In Him do I place my trust, to Him I turn (in repentance)","42:11":"(He is) the Maker of the heavens and the earth! He created spouses for you from your own kind. He created the cattle in pairs, too. Thus, He (multiplies and) scatters you on the earth. He hears and observes everything","42:12":"The keys to the (treasures of) heavens and the earth belong to Him. He expands the provisions _ or limits them _ for whomever He wants. For, He is really Aware (and Mindful) of every single thing","42:13":"He enacted rules (and rites) for your religion which are the same (rules) as He decreed for (the messenger) Nooh. What We have revealed to you are the same commandments as We gave to (the messengers) Ibraheem, Musa and Jesus: (namely) to establish the faith and not (disunite and) splinter into sects. (Oh Muhammad, SAW), what you are calling them towards _ (the worship of the One true god, Allah) _ is too burdensome to bear for those accepting other gods beside Him. Allah selects whom He wants, and guides along His path the one who turns to Him (in repentance)","42:14":"But they splintered into groups even though (divine) knowledge had already come to them, because they wished to (encroach upon and) violate each other´s rights. The matter between them would have been settled, had it not been for the fact that the verdict of your Lord is destined to occur at an appointed time. Indeed, about that, those inheriting the book are gravely in doubt","42:15":"Such is the case! Therefore, (oh Muhammad, SAW), invite (towards His way), and just as you have been ordered, strictly adhere to it yourself. Do not (ever) follow their wishes and whims. Say, \"I believe in the books Allah has revealed. My orders are to treat you fairly. Allah is my Lord and He is your Lord too. Our deeds are for us, and for you are yours! (Let there be) no argument between you and us. Allah will gather and summon us before Him. Towards Him is our return","42:16":"Some people _ (the unbelievers) _ argue about Allah with those who have heard and accepted His call. The arguments and contentions of such people are absurd according to Allah. His wrath will befall them. There exists a severe punishment for them","42:17":"Allah it is, Who has revealed the Book with the truth and the balance (to weigh and check all your deeds for correctness). You just do not know! The hour (of Judgment) may be very close, right around the corner","42:18":"Only the disbelievers (flippantly) ask for it _ (the hour of Judgment) _ to be hastened. The believers, however, are gravely concerned. They know it to be the absolute truth. Be sure! Those who waver and hesitate (and stay in doubt) about the hour have indeed strayed far away","42:19":"Allah is Gracious to His servants. He supplies (ample) provisions to whom He wants; He is the Mighty and the Powerful","42:20":"We multiply the benefits for those who want to reap the worth (of their deeds) in the afterlife. We grant the benefits in this world to those who seek the fruits of their labor, right here in this world. Then, in the afterlife they shall have nothing (left)","42:21":"Do they have gods, the partners (of Allah), who enact the rites and rules of religion for them _ (rules) that are not approved by Allah? The verdict of Allah has been decreed; else their matter would certainly be brought to a close right away. For the evildoers there exists a painful punishment","42:22":"(On that day), you will find the evildoers scared stiff of what they had committed (in this life); what they have committed would come crashing down on them. But those who believe and act righteously, would be in the gardens of paradise. With their Lord, they shall find everything their hearts desire. That, indeed is the greatest honor","42:23":"That is the good news Allah has for His servants, those of them who believe and do the righteous deeds. Say, \"For this (Qur´an,) I do not ask any compensation from you, except the kindness that kinship warrants.\" (Let) whoever earns good deeds (know that) We will increase the benefits (and the worth) of their good deeds. Of course, Allah is Forgiving; and He appreciates gratitude","42:24":"Do they claim that he, (the messenger), has fabricated a lie about Allah? (Oh prophet)! If Allah wants, He can place a seal upon your heart! Allah wipes out the absurd, the false and futile; and He validates the truth with His words. Indeed, He is Aware of everything (including the unexpressed secrets) buried in the chest","42:25":"He it is, Who (hears and) accepts His servants´ repentance. He overlooks and excuses (many of) your misdeeds; but He does know everything you do","42:26":"He answers the prayers of those who believe and act righteously. In fact, by His grace He grants them far in excess (of what they seek). As for the unbelievers, theirs is the severe punishment","42:27":"If Allah had provided abundance and wealth to (all) His servants, they would have become wanton and wayward! Instead, He grants what He wants in measured amounts. Indeed, He watches over His servants, and is well Aware","42:28":"After people abandon and lose hope (about the rainfall), it is He Who sends rain and spreads His mercy around. Indeed, He is the Master worthy of all praise","42:29":"Some of His signs: the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the life He has dispersed in the heavens and on earth. He is capable of bringing them all together, whenever He wants","42:30":"Every calamity that afflicts you, is the result of what your own hands have wrought. (However), He overlooks and excuses many (of your misdeeds)","42:31":"You cannot (expect to) escape and elude (Allah) on earth. Apart from Allah, you shall find no friend and no helper","42:32":"And among His signs are (huge) ships, like mountains (floating) in the sea","42:33":"If He wants, He can cause the winds to cease. The ships would then lie motionless on the surface of the sea. In fact, there are signs in that for every steadfast and grateful person","42:34":"He can destroy (and drown) them as a result of their misdeeds, though he overlooks (and pardons) a lot","42:35":"Let those who (refute and) dispute Our signs know that they have no refuge","42:36":"You have really been granted (the bare essentials, and) the brief enjoyment in the life of this world. What exists with Allah is far superior, and better enduring. It exists for those who believe and place their trust in Allah","42:37":"(It is for those) who stay clear away from the worst of sins and vile deeds; and when in rage, they (control their anger and) forgive","42:38":"(It is for those) who respond to the call of their Lord and establish the ´salat´. They run their affairs by mutual consultation, and spend (for Our sake) out of what We have granted them","42:39":"When oppressed and tyrannized, they rise up and retaliate","42:40":"The recompense (or reprisal) against an evil deed is (allowed, but should be) a deed of the same kind (and no more). But the one who forgives and makes (overtures of) peace is better. His reward falls due on Allah. Of course, He does not like those who do wrong","42:41":"Those who have been wronged may (choose to) exact revenge. They are not to be blamed or berated","42:42":"Rather, blameworthy are those who oppress mankind and commit unjust and flagrant acts in this world. For such people there is a painful punishment","42:43":"But, to bear patiently and forgive is indeed an (admirable) act of courage, and a virtue","42:44":"The one whom Allah leads astray does not have, besides Him, any protection. When the evildoers see their punishment, you will find them wondering (aloud), \"Is there now a possibility to return, (to rescind and recant)","42:45":"There, you will find them placed before the hellfire, disgraced and demeaned. (Anxious and afraid), they would glance at it (nervously) from the edge of their eyes. At that time, the believers would say, \"Indeed they are the losers! They have caused themselves, and their near ones, a great loss on the Day of Judgment.\" Beware! Only the evildoers will land into an everlasting torment","42:46":"They shall have no friends to help them against Allah. There is no escape for the one whom Allah leads astray","42:47":"Respond to the call of your Lord before the inevitable day comes to you from Allah. That day, you shall have no refuge! You will not be able to deny your doings, (or protest your punishment)","42:48":"So, if they turn away (remember), We have not appointed you their keeper. Your duty is to convey (the message). Man rejoices when We let him taste (and enjoy) Our blessings, and becomes ungrateful when, as a result of his own doings, a distress afflicts him","42:49":"The kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. He creates what He wants! He grants daughters to whom He wants, and He grants sons to whom He wants","42:50":"Or, He may grant (to whom He wants) sons as well as daughters. And He may leave whomever He wants infertile and without a child. Indeed, He is Well-aware and Proficient","42:51":"It is not seemly; Allah does not talk to a mortal (directly). He talks to a human (indirectly) from behind a screen, or sparks an inspiration in his mind. Or, He may send (an angel as) a messenger. With His permission, (the angel) conveys what Allah wills. Indeed, He is the most Eminent and the Wisest","42:52":"Similarly, We sent a spirit _ (Angel Gibraeel) _ towards you by Our command. You knew nothing about the book, or the matters of faith. But We made this book a beacon of guidance. By it, We guide any of Our servants We want. Indeed, you are guiding them to the straight path","42:53":"The path of Allah, to Whom belong everything in the heaven and on earth! Beware, all matters come before Allah (for decision)","43:1":"Ha, Meem","43:2":"(Allah swears) by the clear lucid book","43:3":"Indeed, We have revealed this Qur´an in the Arabic language, so you may understand","43:4":"It certainly comes from the master book with Us, (the source of all revelations). It is really sublime and sensible","43:5":"So then, should We pass you over and hold back this Qur´an, because you are a nation guilty of excess","43:6":"Many a prophet did We send to the earlier generations","43:7":"No prophet ever came whom they did not mock (and deride)","43:8":"So We destroyed (those nations); they were stronger and more powerful than these present day unbelievers. The examples of the earlier generations have gone by","43:9":"If you were to ask them, ´Who created the heavens and the earth?´, they would most certainly respond, \"The most Powerful and the most Knowledgeable has created them","43:10":"The One Who set up this earth as a cradle for you! (He, Who) cut paths in the earth for you, so you may find your way","43:11":"The One Who sends rain down from the sky in measured amounts! With it, We resurrect the dead land. In that (exact) manner, you too would be made to rise (from the dead)","43:12":"The One Who created everything in pairs! (The One Who) created the ships and the animals that you ride","43:13":"So that you may remember the favors of your Lord, as you ride the animals on their backs. When you (get aboard a ship, or) mount the animals say, \"Supreme is He Who tamed these for us. We could not (otherwise) have subdued them","43:14":"And we are certainly going to return to our Lord","43:15":"Yet, these people assign some of His servants to be a part of Him. Indeed, man is clearly ungrateful","43:16":"Out of everything He created, did He really choose for Himself daughters, while He blessed you with sons","43:17":"Although, when any of them is given the news (of the birth of a daughter), _ which he so readily associates with the most Merciful _ his face darkens with gloom, and he is filled with grief","43:18":"(You associate with Allah) the offspring that is brought up adorned with jewelry, and cannot assert itself during (times of) conflict (and battle)","43:19":"They depict the angels, who are the servants of Allah, as female beings. At the time of the creation of angels, were they present? Their statements are being written down and they shall be questioned","43:20":"They say, \"We would not be worshipping the angels, unless the most Merciful, (Allah), had so desired.\" Little do they know anything about that! They merely indulge in conjectures","43:21":"Prior to this, had We (ever) revealed to them a book (as an authority), to which they cling so adamantly","43:22":"No! Rather they say, \"We found our parents adhering to a particular way (of life). And now we are following their footsteps","43:23":"Prior to you, the same thing happened to every single town where We sent a warner. The leaders, those living in ease and affluence, said the same thing, \"We found our forefathers practicing a certain way (of life), and now we are emulating their example","43:24":"Every (prophet) asked, \"What if I bring you the guidance that is better than (the customs and rites) you found your forefathers observing (so rigidly)?\" They replied, \"We reject what (you claim) has been revealed to you","43:25":"We exacted revenge from them. So observe, how (horrible) was the outcome for those who rejected","43:26":"Remember, when Ibraheem said to his father and his people, \"I am really fed up (and freed from the blame) of what you (continue to) worship","43:27":"Other than the One Who created me, and He will guide me for sure","43:28":"And Ibraheem bequeathed the enduring words (of truth) to posterity; perhaps they would repent (and return to Allah)","43:29":"In fact, I let these people and their forefathers enjoy (the pleasures of) life. Now the truth (this Qur´an) has come to them, as well as the messenger explaining (everything) clearly","43:30":"When (the knowledge of) the absolute reality came to them, they said, \"This is magic, and surely we refuse to believe it","43:31":"They ask, \"Why is it that this Qur´an is not being revealed to one of the more prominent men of the two cities (Makkah And Taif)","43:32":"Do they dispense the mercy of your Lord? We (alone) distribute among them the means of livelihood in the life of this world. We elevate the status of some of them over others. So that some of them may employ the services of others. (But) the blessings of your Lord are better than the wealth they amass","43:33":"People might all turn into a single community (of disbelievers). Otherwise, We would have given all of them _ all those who refuse to believe in the most Merciful _ houses with the roofs made of silver, and silver stairway they could climb","43:34":"(We would have given them) silver doors for their houses and thrones made of silver to recline on","43:35":"And (exquisite) gold ornaments! But then, it would all be (just) a brief enjoyment of the life of this world. The afterlife with your Lord is (only) for those who (are righteous and) fear (Allah)","43:36":"And We let the Shaitan become an intimate companion of anyone who remains unmindful of the remembrance of Rehman, (the most Merciful)","43:37":"They turn people away from Allah, and yet they consider themselves the rightly guided","43:38":"Until (finally), when one of them comes to Us, he will say (to the Shaitan, his companion in life), \"Oh misery to me!

Or can you point the way to the blind? Or the one who is manifestly misguided and lost","43:41":"Now, We will either take you away and then exact revenge from them","43:42":"Or We would let you see that, with which We have threatened them. Of course, We have full (and unencumbered) control over them","43:43":"Hold on fast to that which has been revealed to you. Of course, you are on the straight path","43:44":"This Qur´an is indeed a reminder for you, and your people. Soon, all of you would be called to account for it","43:45":"Ask the people, to whom We had sent Our messengers prior to you. Did We assign any god to be worshipped, other than the most Merciful (the ´Rehman´)","43:46":"We had surely sent Musa with Our proofs towards the pharaoh and his chiefs. Musa said, \"I am really a messenger of the Lord of the universe","43:47":"As soon as Musa presented Our signs to them, they began to ridicule and mock them","43:48":"We showed them many of Our signs, each greater than the last. Then, We grabbed them with a calamity. Perhaps they would turn back (to Us)","43:49":"(Whenever a calamity struck them), they said to Musa, \"Oh you magician!

Why did angels not accompany him as associates","43:54":"Thus, he prevailed upon his nation; they obeyed him (and disparaged Musa). They were indeed a sinful people","43:55":"Finally, they provoked Our wrath and We took Our revenge. We drowned them all","43:56":"We made their case a precedent, and a lesson for posterity","43:57":"When (Jesus) the son of Mary (i.e. his fatherless birth) is quoted as an example, your people raise a hue and cry","43:58":"They say, \"Are our gods better or is he _ (Jesus)?\" They raise such questions merely to argue and bicker. Indeed, they are a quarrelsome belligerent people","43:59":"(Jesus, son of Mary) was nothing more than Our servant. We heaped Our favors upon him and We deemed him, (and his birth), to be an eye opener and a warning for the children of Israel","43:60":"(We created Jesus without a father, and) if We want We can create from you _ (the human kind) _ a generation of angels to supplant and succeed you on earth","43:61":"In fact he, (and his fatherless birth), is a sign _ a proof of the hour (of Judgment). Therefore, have no doubt and obey Me! That is the straight path","43:62":"Make sure Shaitan does not alienate you (from Allah); he is really a professed enemy of yours","43:63":"When Jesus brought the clear proofs (from Allah), he said, \"I have come to you with wisdom (the prophethood); so I may sift and settle some of the issues about which you have discord and disagreements (amongst you). So fear Allah and follow me","43:64":"Indeed! Allah is my Lord; and He is your Lord, too! So worship Him (exclusively). That is the straight path","43:65":"Yet, the sects (of his followers) continued to defy and bicker among themselves. So misery and a painful punishment on the day (of Judgment) is for those who do evil","43:66":"Are they waiting for the hour (of Judgment) to creep up on them suddenly, when they least expect it","43:67":"Except the righteous ones, all friends on that day would become each other´s enemies","43:68":"(Allah will say) \"Oh my servants!

There, they shall be depressed and desolate, (forever)","43:76":"We were not unjust to them. Rather, they were themselves unjust (committing outrageous acts)","43:77":"They will call out to (the keeper of hell), \"Oh master, let your Lord finish us off!\" And he will respond, \"You shall definitely languish (in hell for ever)","43:78":"We had surely brought you the absolute truth.

(He is) far above what they attribute to Him","43:83":"So let them be lost in their nonsense notions, and their play and past times, till they confront their promised day (in the court of Allah)","43:84":"He it is, Who is the (only) God in the heavens, and the God on earth. He is the Wisest and the all-Knowing","43:85":"Blessed is He! To Him belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and everything in between. The knowledge of the hour (of resurrection) rests with Him exclusively. To Him you shall all return","43:86":"The beings they invoke beside Him, lack the ability to intercede (with Him). They can (only) testify regarding that which they know for a fact","43:87":"Were you to ask them, as to who created them they would surely say, \"Allah!\" Why then are they being fooled","43:88":"(Allah knows) the words of the prophet, \"Oh Lord, these are the people who do not believe","43:89":"(Oh prophet)!

That is a painful punishment","44:12":"(They would cry out). \"Our Lord! Release us from the painful punishment. We would (now) definitely become the believers","44:13":"Why this change of heart? (Earlier) the messenger had come to them, and had explained matters to them clearly.

After (rejecting) Allah and His verses, what else would they believe","45:7":"Misery to every sinful liar","45:8":"(Misery to) the one who hears the verses of Allah being recited before him, yet acts like he has not heard them at all. Haughtily, he insists (upon his own notions). To such a one, give the news of an agonizing torment","45:9":"He mocks whatever little he learns about Our verses. A humiliating punishment exists for such a one","45:10":"The hellfire is their future! What they earn, (and amass in this world), would not help them at all.

There is an agonizing excruciating punishment for those who refuse to believe the signs of their Lord","45:12":"It is Allah Who has calmed the oceans for you, in order to let the ships sail through them by His command, and so that you may seek His blessings. Perhaps you would express gratitude","45:13":"And for you, He has subdued whatever is in the heavens and on earth _ everything (as a favor) from Him.

Then, towards your Lord you shall (all) return","45:16":"We had certainly given the book, the wisdom and the prophethood to the children of Israel. We blessed them with the wholesome provisions (of life). We had given them precedence over the whole world","45:17":"And We gave them clear instructions about every matter. It was only after (real) knowledge had come to them, that they indulged in internecine rivalry. It was (not out of ignorance but) with intent to wrong each other.

So follow that, and do not give in to the whims of those who do not know","45:19":"They shall not be able to help you a bit against Allah. Indeed, the evildoers are each other´s friends and patrons, and Allah is the friend of the righteous","45:20":"This (Qur´an) is an insight for all mankind, the source of guidance and grace for any nation that affirms the faith","45:21":"Do they think that We would treat the unbelievers committing evil deeds, in just the same manner as We treat the believers performing the righteous deeds? Should their lives and their deaths be equal? How wrong is their judgment","45:22":"Allah created the heavens and the earth with justice. So that every being may receive compensation, commensurate with what it earns (in this life). No one shall be wronged","45:23":"And how about the one, who takes his fancies and fantasies as his god? Allah has purposely allowed him to go astray; Allah has placed a seal upon his heart and his hearing, and has laid a (thick) veil over his eyes. Now, other than Allah, who can guide him? Do they not heed, then","45:24":"They say, \"There is nothing except our life in this world; here is where we die, or survive. There is nothing but fate, (just the vicissitudes of life) that destroys us.\" They do not have any (real) knowledge about that! They merely speculate","45:25":"When Our clear unambiguous verses are read to them, they are left with no answer. By way of rebuttal they merely retort, \"Bring our forefathers back to life, if you are right","45:26":"Say, \"Allah gives you life, and then He gives you death; and again, He will assemble you on the day of resurrection. No doubt about it! But most people do not know","45:27":"The kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. The day the hour (of Judgment) dawns, is the day the followers of falsehood _ (the followers of absurd notions, and the vain and trivial pursuits) _ will incur a severe loss","45:28":"(That day) you would see (the people of) every nation humbled and dropped on their knees. Each of them will be summoned to (look at) his book of deeds. (They would be told), \"Today, you will face the results and consequences of what you used to do","45:29":"This record of deeds prepared by Us speaks (for itself); and it is the precise evidence against you. Of course, We had recorded everything you used to do","45:30":"There, at that time, the Lord will admit into His mercy (only) the believers _ those with righteous deeds to their credit. And that is a definite unequivocal achievement","45:31":"To the unbelievers (Allah will say), \"Is it not a fact, that My verses had been read to you? But you were arrogant and disdainful! You are the criminal nation","45:32":"You were told that the promise of Allah is the absolute truth, and that there is no doubt about the hour (of Judgment).\" But you said, \"We do not know about the hour. We think it is only a belief; we are not certain","45:33":"The evil of their deeds will (then) become apparent to them. That, which they (now) ridicule, (will come back to haunt them and) will surround them","45:34":"They would be told, \"Today, We shall spurn (and slight) you, just like you had ignored the meeting of this day. Fire shall be your abode, and you shall find no one to help you","45:35":"That is because you took the verses of Allah lightly; you mocked them. The (temporary and temporal) life of this world duped and deceived you. This day (onwards), you shall not be taken out of hellfire.

Those others will never respond to their prayers, till the day of resurrection. They are, indeed, oblivious of the fact that they are being worshipped","46:6":"(On the day of resurrection) when all mankind is assembled, these false deities would turn hostile against their worshippers, and would disown their adherents´ acts of devotion","46:7":"Our clear lucid verses were read to them. But, referring to the truth as it came to them, the unbelievers said, \"This is obviously a magic","46:8":"Or do they say that he, (the messenger), has made it all up? Say, \"If this is so, then you have no ability at all to back me against Allah! He is better aware of the rancorous remarks you utter against it, (the Qur´an). He suffices as a witness between you and me. He is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","46:9":"Say, \"I am neither novel nor unprecedented among the messengers. I do not know what will happen to you or me. I merely follow what is revealed to me. I am simply a clear-cut warner","46:10":"When you rejected this Qur´an, did you ever pause to ponder? What if it really is from Allah? A (learned) witness amongst the Israelites declared his belief in it, while you displayed arrogance! Indeed, Allah does not guide the nation of evildoers","46:11":"The unbelievers say about those who believe, \"Had it been the truth, they could not have surpassed us in faith. \"Since they did not gain any guidance from it (the Qur´an), the unbelievers say, \"It is the same old trumped up lie","46:12":"Prior to this, the book of Musa was the guide and mercy. This book, (the Qur´an) is in the Arabic language and it confirms and validates (the book of Musa). It warns those committing evil, and gives the good news to the righteous","46:13":"Indeed! Those who say, \"Allah is our Lord\" and then stand firm (on their belief) shall have nothing to fear. Nor will they ever grieve (or be sorry)","46:14":"Such are the inhabitants of paradise! They shall live there forever; their reward for what they used to do","46:15":"We have made it incumbent upon man to treat his parents with kindness. His mother carried him with difficulty, and went through labor in pain. The pregnancy and weaning takes a total period of thirty months. Then when he reaches forty years of age and has attained his full strength (and potential), he says, \"My Lord, instill in me the courage to be grateful for the blessings You have showered upon me and my parents. Inspire me to do good deeds _ the deeds that please You. (My Lord) make my offspring righteous. I turn to You in repentance and I am one of those who submit (to Your will)","46:16":"Such are the ones! We would accept the best of their deeds, and We would overlook their faults and shortcomings. They shall be among the inhabitants of paradise. The solemn and sincere promise made to them (in the life of the world) will indeed be fulfilled","46:17":"(On the other hand), there is the one who says to his parents, \"Oh really, I am fed up with you two! Are you really asking me to believe that I would be restored back to life (after my death)? Generations have passed before me, (and nobody has ever come back)!\" His parents invoke Allah´s help and say, \"Woe unto you! Believe it! Allah´s promise is indeed the truth.\" But he (doesn´t listen, and) says, \"These are nothing but (old) tales of people long gone","46:18":"Such are the ones who deserve the doom. The decision has been decreed against them, and other jinn and humans (like them) in the generations gone by. Indeed, all of them are the losers","46:19":"Based on his deeds, each one will have a different status (in paradise, and in hell), so that He may fully (and appropriately) compensate them for their deeds. No one will be wronged","46:20":"The day the unbelievers are brought before the hellfire (they would be told), \"You availed and squandered the good things in the life of the world. Today, you would be punished with a disgraceful torment, because you were arrogant in the land without a reason, and because you transgressed and disobeyed","46:21":"And remember (Hood), the brother of a people called ´Aad´? He warned his folks who lived in (a place called) ´Aikah´. Other warners had gone by ahead of him, and had followed him (in that land). He said, \"Do not worship anyone except Allah! In fact, I am afraid that a torment of a tremendous day might strike you down","46:22":"They replied, \"Have you come to lure us away from our gods. So, go ahead! If you are truthful, have that torment _ the one with which you threaten us _ visit us","46:23":"(The messenger) said, \"Indeed, the knowledge (about the time of that torment) rests with Allah alone. I conveyed to you whatever was revealed to me. But I see that you are an ignorant people","46:24":"Then, as they saw the dense cloud advancing towards their valleys, they said, \"This is the cloud! It will bring us (the welcome) rain.\" ….. \"No it will not! Rather, it is that which you had asked to be hastened. Wind! In it is a painful punishment","46:25":"By its Lord´s command, it will destroy everything.\" They were wiped out completely! Except for their ruins and dwellings, no traces of them could be seen! This is how We punish the guilty nation","46:26":"We had certainly consolidated them; We had strengthened (and established) them much more than We have strengthened you. We granted them the faculties of hearing, sight and intellect. But since they used to dispute and deny the revelations of Allah, their hearing, sight and intellect did not benefit them a bit.

Why do those beings not help them (now)? In fact, those beings have now vanished. They are just some trumped up tales and lies, they had invented","46:29":"And recall the time (oh Muhammad, SAW) when We turned a small group of jinn towards you to hear the Qur´an (being recited). As they came closer, they said (to each other), \"Be quiet and listen attentively.\" When the recitation ended they went back to their people to warn them","46:30":"Oh our people! We (just) listened to a book revealed after (the book of) Musa. It confirms the one (revealed) before it; and it guides towards the truth, and along the straight path","46:31":"Oh our people! Respond to the one calling towards Allah, and believe in him! (Allah) will forgive your sins; and He will spare you from the painful punishment","46:32":"Whoever refuses to respond to the one calling towards Allah, cannot elude Him on earth; he cannot find any friends or protectors to guard him against (Allah). Such ones are clearly lost and wayward","46:33":"And do they not see that Allah it is Who created the heavens and the earth. He did not feel tired by this creation, and He is capable of giving life to the dead. Of course, He is indeed capable of doing everything","46:34":"On that day as they are brought before the hellfire, the unbelievers would be asked, \"Is this not the truth?\" They would reply, \"It is, and (we swear) by our Lord, (it is the truth). He, (the Lord) would say, \"So, because you used to disbelieve, taste the torment now","46:35":"So, (oh prophet), be patient! Just as (all) the determined messengers (of earlier times) had endured with patience. Concerning the unbelievers, do not be in a haste (to seek the verdict against them). On that day, they will clearly see the torment with which they are being threatened (today). It would seem to them, as if they did not stay (in the world) for more than an hour of a day. The message is conveyed! Now, who else would face destruction, if not the nation of evil doers _ the rebels","47:1":"Those who disbelieve and obstruct others from the way of Allah, have really squandered their good deeds","47:2":"Allah will straighten the affairs of those who believe, perform good deeds, and believe in what is revealed to Mohammed (SAW). That which is revealed, is the truth from their Lord. He will rinse their faults clean","47:3":"That is because the disbelievers follow falsehood, whereas the believers follow the truth from their Lord! Thus Allah cites their examples for the people","47:4":"So, when you clash with the disbelievers (in battle) slay them! If you over power them, take them prisoners and secure them well. Later when the weapons are laid down, either release them on ransom, or graciously on their own (as a favor). Allah could have exacted revenge, had He wanted; But He wants to test some of you by certain others among you. Allah will never waste the deeds of those who are slain in the way of Allah","47:5":"He will soon guide them and set their affairs right","47:6":"He will usher them into paradise; He has already familiarized them with it","47:7":"Oh you who believe! If you help Allah, He will support you and establish you firmly in the land","47:8":"And those who disbelieve Allah, fell flat on their faces! He lets their actions go astray","47:9":"They dislike that which Allah has revealed! Therefore, He lets their deeds lose all their worth","47:10":"Have they not moved about in the land? Do they not observe the ultimate fate of those before them? Allah annihilated them! A similar fate awaits those who do not believe","47:11":"Because the believers have Allah as their Patron, while the unbelievers have no patron","47:12":"Indeed, Allah will let those who believe, and perform good deeds, enter paradise; rivers run right through it! And fire shall be the abode of those who disbelieve. In this life, they eat and live out their existence like cattle","47:13":"Many a town, stronger than yours that has expelled you, have We destroyed! Then they found no helpers for themselves","47:14":"Can (the fate of) one following clear instructions of his Lord be similar to the one who follows his own whims and wishes? Their evil deeds have been made to appear good to them","47:15":"The paradise that the pious are being promised contains rivers of water without a stink, milk the taste of which undergoes no change, wine that tastes sumptuous, and strained honey. In it, they shall have every kind of fruit! And forgiveness from their Lord! Could he (in paradise) be compared to the one who shall be in fire till eternity, and shall be served scalding hot water which will split open his intestines","47:16":"Among them are those who come to hear you. But after leaving, they ask those who know, \"What did he say just now?\" Allah has stamped their hearts! They follow their whims and wishes","47:17":"Allah increases in guidance those who accept His advice. He awards them piety","47:18":"So what are they still waiting for? The hour (of Judgment)? It shall come upon them suddenly and surreptitiously. Its signs have already appeared! Where would they get their guidance once the hour has arrived","47:19":"Know it! For sure, there is no god but Allah! Seek forgiveness for your sins as well as the sins of the believing men and the believing women. Allah is Aware of their movement on earth, and their places of residence","47:20":"And those who believe were wondering out loud, as to why no revelation has been sent down (exhorting fighting to defend themselves)? Did you observe? When the definite order about fighting was revealed, those with diseased hearts stared at you like the one about to faint with the fear of death! So, evil is for them","47:21":"Only obedience and welcome remarks are accepted, once the order is revealed. Had they stayed loyal to Allah, they would have fared better","47:22":"If given authority in the land, you would disobey (Allah), spread mischief, and violate the family ties","47:23":"Those are the ones Allah has cursed. He has made them go deaf, and has blinded their eyes","47:24":"Have they never pondered over this Qur´an? Or do they have locks placed on their hearts","47:25":"They turned away, even though the guidance itself had convinced them of its truth. Therefore, Shaitan deceived them and gave them false hope","47:26":"Because they say to those who hate Allah´s revelation, \"In some matters we will follow you.\" Allah is well-Aware of their secret conversation","47:27":"Imagine when the angels will take possession of their souls, slapping their faces and their backs","47:28":"Their good deeds lost their worth, because they followed that which displeases Allah, and because they dislike seeking the pleasure of Allah","47:29":"Do those with diseased hearts think that Allah will never expose their weaknesses","47:30":"If We want We could have you recognize them by their very faces. But you may recognize them by their features, and by the way they talk. Indeed, Allah knows all your deeds","47:31":"Surely, We shall continue to test you, till We know the ones who struggle hard for Allah and remain steadfast; and We will test you in all your affairs","47:32":"The disbelievers __ those who obstructed people from coming to the path of Allah, and have caused distress to His messenger, even after clear guidance had arrived __ will not harm Allah a bit! Allah will make their deeds lose all value","47:33":"Oh those of you who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the messenger. Do not waste your good deeds","47:34":"Allah will never forgive those who continue to disbelieve, and obstruct people from the path of Allah, right until the time they die","47:35":"So, do not become lax. Continue to call towards Islam. You will be the winner! Allah will not diminish the worth of your deeds","47:36":"Life in this world is nothing but fun and games! If you believe, and be pious, He will grant you your just rewards. He will not ask for your wealth","47:37":"If He demands your wealth and continues to do so, you will be stingy and He will expose your weaknesses","47:38":"Here you are, now. You are being invited to spend in the path of Allah. Among you are those who are stingy; he who acts stingily does so for his own self! Allah is over and above all needs. You are the paupers! If you turn away, Allah will bring in your place others, who would not be like you","48:1":"Indeed, (oh Muhammad SAW), We granted you a definite victory","48:2":"So Allah may forgive all your sins, the ones in the past as well as those in the future, so He may conclude His blessings upon you and may guide you on to the straight path","48:3":"So Allah may award you a convincing victory","48:4":"He it is, Who caused the hearts of the believers to be serene and sedate. He enhanced their faith, and added conviction to their belief. To Allah belong the forces of the heavens and the earth. Allah is well Aware and the Wisest","48:5":"So He may usher the believing men and the believing women into the gardens of paradise _ rivers run right through it. They shall live there forever, and He will cleanse their sins (and correct their faults and flaws). That according to Allah, is the greatest triumph","48:6":"And so He may punish the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women, and the polytheist men and the polytheist women _ those who hold the worst of beliefs about Allah. A string of evil surrounds them! Allah is furious with them. He has cursed them, and has prepared the hellfire for them. That is the evil path","48:7":"The forces of the heavens and the earth belong to Allah! Allah is the Mighty, the Wisest","48:8":"In fact, We have sent you, (O Muhammad, SAW) as a witness; as a harbinger of good news, and as a warner (of His wrath)","48:9":"Therefore, (oh mankind!) you should believe in Allah and His messenger, respect and revere Him, and chant His praises every morning and evening","48:10":"Indeed, those who took the oath of allegiance to you, (oh Muhammad, SAW), were in fact pledging their allegiance to Allah. It was actually Allah´s hand over their hand! So now, whoever violates (the pledge) does so to his own detriment. Allah will grant a generous reward to the one who (faithfully) fulfills the covenant with Him","48:11":"The wandering Bedouin Arabs, those who (deliberately) lagged behind, will (no doubt) say to you, \"Our assets and our families kept us busy. So pray (to Allah) for our forgiveness.\" With their lips they utter that which is (just) not there in their hearts. Say, \"Does anyone have even the slightest ability to stop Allah, if He intends to hurt you _ or help you? Allah is well Aware of what you do","48:12":"In fact, you thought that the messenger and the believers would not ever return (from their mission) to see their families, and that thought heartened you. You imagined and anticipated the worst (for them). You are a worthless wicked people","48:13":"Whoever does not believe in Allah and the messenger (should be warned that), for the unbelievers We have really prepared a blazing fire","48:14":"The kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah. He pardons whom He wants and punishes whom He wants. Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Kind","48:15":"Those who lagged behind will (no doubt) say, \"Let us be with you when you leave for the loot (and the spoils of war).\" They (actually) intend to modify the word (and the verdict) of Allah! Tell them, \"You shall not accompany us now. Allah has already said so, earlier.\" Then, they would say, \"In fact, you are discriminating against us.\" On the contrary, they are the ones who hardly understand anything","48:16":"Say to the wandering Bedouins who had (deliberately) lagged behind earlier, \"Soon you would be called into combat against a people possessing considerable martial strength and skill, unless they surrender. You shall have to face them in battle. (That would be your test)! Then, if you obey, Allah would grant you an excellent reward. Conversely, if you turn your backs like you did earlier, He would chastise you with a painful punishment","48:17":"There is no blame upon the blind and the lame (those handicapped); nor upon those who are sick. (They may not heed the call to Jihad, all-out struggle for His sake). Allah will usher into the gardens of paradise _ right through which run the rivers _ all those who obey Him, and His messenger. He will punish with the painful torment anyone who turns his back","48:18":"Allah was definitely well pleased with the believers when they, as they sat under the tree, pledged their allegiance to you. He knew what was in their heart, so He bestowed a comforting calm upon them. As a reward, He arranged for them a victory in the near future","48:19":"They will acquire an abundance of booty. Allah is the Mighty, the Wisest","48:20":"Allah has promised that you would capture a lot of booty in the future. Meanwhile, He has granted you this (victory) in advance. He restrained the hands of men _ (your enemies); He kept them from hurting you! So that it may serve as a sign for the believers; so that He may guide you on to the straight path","48:21":"And (He promises you) other (bounties)! You are (as yet) not capable of achieving them. But Allah has earmarked them (for you). Allah is capable of accomplishing everything","48:22":"If the unbelievers had engaged you in combat at that time, they would have turned their backs (and fled). Then, they would not have found any allies or supporters","48:23":"Such is the norm, the established way of Allah, which is in force since a very long time. You shall not find any change in the established practice of Allah","48:24":"It is He Who restrained their hands (and kept them) from (hurting) you. After He had caused you to triumph over them in the city of Makkah, He held your hands back (and kept you) from (hurting) them. Allah watches everything you do","48:25":"It is they, the unbelievers, who prevented you from reaching the Holy mosque and prevented the animals pledged for sacrifice from reaching the site of the sacrificial slaughter. But, there were believing men and women in their midst whom you did not know. Unwittingly, you would have killed them, and unknowingly you would have suffered the sin (of having killed the believers). Therefore, Allah restrained your hands, so that He might admit into His mercy whomever He wants. Had they (the believing men and women) stood apart, We would have punished the disbelievers with the painful punishment","48:26":"Right then, the unbelievers displayed arrogance; they bolstered their hearts with an ignorant and boastful zealotry. Allah conferred a comforting calm over His messenger, and the believers. He imposed upon them (the self-restraint, and) the words of piety. They were worthy of that (honor); they deserved it! Allah is well Aware of every single thing","48:27":"Of course, Allah caused His messenger to witness a true vision in his dream. (It shall come true)! You would definitely, Allah willing, enter the holy mosque in peace; you would, without any fear, get your head shaved or your hair trimmed. He knows that which you do not know. Besides this one, He has arranged another victory for you in the near future","48:28":"He it is, Who has sent His messenger with the guidance, and the religion of truth. So He may cause it to prevail over all (false) religions, (over all ism, and in all walks of life). Allah is a sufficient Witness","48:29":"Muhammad, (SAW), is the messenger of Allah. He and his followers are tough on the unbelievers; but they are kind to each other. You see them bowing, and falling down prostrate (before Allah) seeking His favors and His acceptance. The distinctive effect of prostrating (before their Creator) is apparent on their faces. Such is their description in the Torah. About them, the Gospel quotes the parable, \"It is as if the seed is sown in the field. In time it sprouts and sends up a tiny green shoot. Then, it becomes strong and stout, and stands on its stalk. It delights the sower and enrages the unbelievers.\" Allah promises forgiveness and a tremendous reward to those of the believers who perform the righteous deeds","49:1":"Oh you who believe! Do not place yourself ahead of Allah, and His messenger. Fear Allah! Indeed Allah hears all and knows all","49:2":"Oh you who believe! Do not raise your voice, (or stress your views), over that of the prophet. Do not shriek, or snap at him like you (often) do with each other; lest you might, without knowing, lose the worth of all your (good) deeds","49:3":"Those who lower their voices, (and their views), in the presence of the messenger of Allah are actually the ones whose hearts Allah has inspected and approved for piety. There is forgiveness and a tremendous reward for them","49:4":"Of course, most of those who call out to you from outside your chamber have no sense","49:5":"Had they waited patiently till you came out to (see) them, it would have been better for them. Allah is the most Forgiving, and the most Merciful","49:6":"Oh those of you who believe, if someone wicked brings you a report, investigate (and ascertain the facts). Else, you might attack a people out of ignorance, and later get to regret your actions","49:7":"And beware! Amongst you is the messenger of Allah. You would certainly be in trouble, had he accepted your advice in most matters. But Allah has endeared faith to you, and He has beautified your heart with it. He aroused in you a disgust for disbelief, depravity and disobedience. Such are the ones following the right course of action","49:8":"An honor from Allah, a favor! Allah is all Knowing and the Wisest","49:9":"If peace breaks down between two groups of believers, and they begin to fight, (call a truce and) bring them to terms. If one of the groups is the transgressor, (all of you should) fight the group that is unjust, until it complies and returns to the commands of Allah. Once that happens, make peace between the groups fairly and equitably. Indeed Allah loves those who are just","49:10":"(All) the believers are brothers. Therefore, promote peace and conciliation between two brothers; and fear Allah. Perhaps you may receive mercy","49:11":"Oh you who believe! Let not one ethnic group ridicule another ethnic group. It may just be that those being mocked are actually better. Similarly, do not let (some) women deride other women, because the women being laughed at, may happen to be better. Do not defame or slander each other. Do not yell (racial, ethnic or other) slurs and epithets at each other. After entering faith, it is not right to insult others with disdainful names. Those who fail to repent and desist are really the evildoers","49:12":"Oh you who believe! Avoid being overly suspicious. Some suspicions are, in fact, outright sins. Do not engage in (unwarranted) curiosity; and do not speak ill of others behind their back. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? (Surely) you would feel disgust (at such a thought). So fear Allah! Indeed, Allah accepts repentance and is the most Kind","49:13":"Oh you people! We have certainly created you from one man, and a woman. Then We (multiplied you and) formed you into nations and tribes, (just) so you may identify and recognize each other. Indeed, according to Allah the nobler among you is (none other than) the one who fears Allah the most! Indeed, Allah is all-Knowing and well-Aware of everything","49:14":"The Bedouins say, \"We believe!\" Tell them, \"No, you do not believe! Rather say that you have submitted (to Islam). Belief has not even entered your hearts, yet!\" Still if you obey Allah and His messenger, He will not take away anything at all from the reward you deserve for your deeds. Of course, Allah is the most Forgiving, and the most Merciful","49:15":"The (true) believers are actually those who believe in Allah and His messenger and then do not waver (and do not entertain doubts). With their wealth and their lives, they strive for the sake of Allah. Such are truly the sincere ones","49:16":"Say, \"Are you trying to inform Allah about your beliefs? Allah knows everything in the heavens and on earth. Allah is well-Aware of every single thing","49:17":"Because they have submitted to Islam, they boast of having done you a favor. Say, \"Do not hold your (faith in) Islam to be a favor upon me. Rather, Allah has shown you a favor; He has guided you to faith, if you are truthful","49:18":"Undoubtedly, Allah knows the secrets of the heavens and the earth, and Allah watches what you do","50:1":"Qaf, (Allah swears) by the Glorious Qur´an","50:2":"In fact, they are surprised because one of their own, (a mortal like themselves), came to them as a warner. The unbelievers said, \"That is really odd","50:3":"(Would we live again) after we die and become dust? Such a return (to life) is far-fetched, (a fantasy)","50:4":"(Really)? We know very well everything that the earth consumes from their (dead decomposing) bodies. With Us is the book that (records and) preserves (every event)","50:5":"No! In fact they rejected the truth (about the hereafter) just as soon as it came to them. So now they are perturbed and perplexed","50:6":"(Isn´t life after death likely)? Did they not ever look at the sky above them? (Did they not wonder) how We made and adorned it? Lapses it does lack; it is free of flaws","50:7":"And (what about) the earth? We laid out the earth, placed mountains firmly upon it, and caused all sorts of delightful plant life to proliferate on it","50:8":"These are the (clues), insights and reminders for every human being, anyone turning (to Allah) in repentance","50:9":"From the sky We sent down the water as (Our) blessing; and with it, We produced the gardens and the harvested grain","50:10":"As also the tall date trees with their densely clustered dates","50:11":"(Such is) the provision for My servants! With that water, We bring the dead land back to life. The emergence (of the dead back to life) shall happen in much the same manner","50:12":"Prior to them, ( the present day unbelievers), the nation of Nooh, the people of ´Russ´, and ´Samood´ had rejected (life-after-death)","50:13":"And ´Aads´, the pharaohs and the brethren of Loot","50:14":"The people of ´Aikah´, and the nation of ´Tubbah´. Each of them rejected the messengers. So (My) threat became a reality","50:15":"Were We not capable of bringing this creation into being the first time? Yet, they are uncertain about the new creation, ( the revival of creation)","50:16":"Indeed, We have created man, and (so) We are surely aware of every thought that crosses his mind. We are closer to him than his jugular vein","50:17":"(Remember)! The two sentries, (the two angels responsible for recording deeds), _ one sitting on the right (shoulder), the other on the left _ are receiving (and recording everything)","50:18":"Not a word uttered by any person, escapes (the attention of) the vigilant observers _ (the angels assigned over him)","50:19":"The agony (and stupor) of death will bring about the truth, \"This is the very thing you used to avoid and evade","50:20":"Then the trumpet shall sound, \"This is the promised day _ (the day of reckoning)","50:21":"Every soul will arrive accompanied by (two angels), a guard and a witness","50:22":"You had certainly been unmindful of this! We have lifted the scales off your eyes. So, very sharp is your vision today","50:23":"And his companion, (the escorting Angel) would declare, \"This one under my custody (and his record of deeds) is ready","50:24":"Hurl every stubborn unbeliever into hell","50:25":"The one who forbade the good, the transgressor, the skeptic","50:26":"The one who assigned a god (for worship), besides Allah. So toss him into the toughest of torment","50:27":"His comrade, (the Shaitan) would submit, \"Our Lord, I did not force him to transgress and rebel. He was wayward himself; quite far astray","50:28":"(Allah) will say, \"Refrain from quarrelling in My presence. I had certainly warned you in advance","50:29":"The sentence rendered by Me shall not be reversed. I am not (at all) cruel to My servants","50:30":"That day, We shall ask the hell, \"Are you full?\" It will reply, \"Are there more","50:31":"The paradise would move closer to the righteous; wouldn´t be far (at all)","50:32":"This (is the coveted prize) you had been pledged! (It is) for all those who always turn to Allah in sincere repentance and (grudgingly) guard (their covenant with Allah)","50:33":"(It is) for the one who feared (Allah), the most Merciful, the Unseen; (for the one who) returned to Him with a repentant heart","50:34":"In peace (and bliss), enter the paradise! This is the day of eternity","50:35":"There, they shall have anything they want; and yet We have more (for them)","50:36":"Many nations have We destroyed (for their sins) prior to them _ nations that were stronger, (more developed) and mightier. They penetrated (and colonized many) other lands. But did they find any place to escape","50:37":"Indeed, there is a lesson in it for anyone who possesses a heart (that feels); anyone who listens attentively and applies his mind","50:38":"We have certainly created the heavens and the earth, and everything else between them, in six periods of time. And that did not wear Us out, the least bit","50:39":"Have patience, and tolerate what they say. Chant the praises of your Lord (every day) before sunrise and before sunset","50:40":"Also, chant His praises at night; and (glorify Him again) at the end of prostration (during each prayer)","50:41":"Listen! The day the trumpeter calls from a nearby place","50:42":"Is the day they shall hear the blast, the call of truth! That will be the day of release (from the graves)","50:43":"Indeed, We (alone) bestow life, and We give death. Towards Us, is the return trip (of every soul)","50:44":"That day, the earth will split open, allowing them to emerge (from their graves) in a hurry. (Carrying out) such (a feat of) gathering (of all souls) is quite easy for Us","50:45":"We know quite well what they say. (You may not compel them), and you are not (appointed) a tyrant over them.

(They would hear), \"There is good news for you, to day!\" (They shall have) the paradise _ rivers run right through it _ and they shall live there forever. That, in fact, is the greatest triumph","57:13":"That day, the hypocrite men and women would say to the believers, \"Look at us and let us borrow (and avail) a little of your light.\" (But) they would be told, \"Turn back! Go find your own light!\" Thereupon, a wall would be set in place between them and the believers. The gate (in the wall) would lock in (the believers and) the mercy and grace (of Allah) on the inside. While on the outside (of the enclosure) would be nothing but torture","57:14":"They would call the believers (saying), \"Were we not with you (in the life of this world)?\" The believers would reply, \"Of course, but you let yourself be tempted. You waited, (hesitated), and entertained doubts. Your hopes and expectations deceived (and lulled) you, until the decree arrived from Allah. The master deceiver, (the Shaitan), deceived you about Allah","57:15":"And today, no ransom would be accepted from you or from those who had disbelieved. Fire is your _ and your companion´s _ abode. It is an evil end of the journey","57:16":"Is it not time yet, that the hearts of the believers should stir with the mention of Allah, and the absolute truth that has come to them? Do not be like those who were given the scriptures earlier. After the passage of a long time, their hearts became hardened. Today, most of them are evildoers","57:17":"You should know that Allah gives life back to the land after its death. We have already explained the signs to you. Perhaps you would understand","57:18":"Indeed, there is a generous reward for the men and women who give charity, and advance a virtuous loan to Allah. He will increase it manifolds (and give them due credit)","57:19":"The really honest and upright are those who believe in Allah and His messengers. According to Allah, they are the (true) witnesses. They shall have the reward and the light. While those who refute and reject Our signs are going to be the people of hell","57:20":"You should know that the life of this world is (nothing but) fun and games _ merely play and pastime. (It consists of) the bragging and boasting among you about the adornments and embellishments (of your existence), and the abundance of your wealth and children. It is just like the shower of rain, which causes lush green (fields) that please the tillers. (But) later on, it dries up and you see it turn pale and become chaff. In the life-to-come, there is severe punishment (for the unbelievers), and forgiveness from Allah and His acceptance (for the believers). The life of this world is (nothing but) an illusive deception _ a brief enjoyment","57:21":"Rush towards forgiveness of your Lord and the paradise (He has promised). Its expanse is like the vastness of the sky and the earth; and it has been prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers. That is the grace of Allah. He confers it upon whomever He wants! Allah is the Lord of great honor","57:22":"No calamity (ever) strikes the earth _ or you _ that is not (already written) in the book of decrees. (Written) much earlier, before We cause the calamity to come about. That is really easy for Allah","57:23":"So that you would not feel morose (and mournful) over matters that elude you.

(Now), should anyone turn back (remember), Allah is Free of all want and Worthy of all praise","57:25":"We have certainly sent Our messengers with clear proofs. We revealed to them the scriptures and the criteria (to distinguish the right from wrong), so that you may establish justice. We revealed iron (to mankind). It has considerable might and many uses for mankind. (So that) Allah may know who helps Him and His messengers without having seen (Him). Indeed, Allah is (very) Strong and Powerful","57:26":"We sent Nooh and Ibraheem (as messengers), and We established the prophethood and the scriptures among their descendants. (Some) among them are rightly guided, but most of them are evildoers","57:27":"Then, We had many messengers follow in their footsteps _ one after another. (Eventually), We sent , the son of Mary and gave him the Gospel. We instilled compassion and mercy in the hearts of those who followed him. (As for) the monasticism, We did not impose it on them. They invented it themselves. (By such means), they sought the acceptance and the pleasure of Allah. Yet, they did not abide by the demands of monasticism. We granted the reward to those of them who believed. Most of them, (however), are evildoers","57:28":"Oh you who believe! Fear Allah and have faith in His messenger. He will grant you twice (the portion of) His mercy. He will grant you light by which you shall walk (along the straight path)! And He will grant you forgiveness! Indeed, Allah is oft-Forgiving, the most Merciful","57:29":"So the people of the book may know that they do not have any control (or exclusive right) over (the distribution of) Allah´s bounties. In fact, the bounties rest in the hands of Allah, and He confers them upon whomever He wishes. Allah is the Lord of the highest honor","58:1":"(Oh prophet)! Allah has certainly heard the remarks of the woman who pleaded with you concerning her husband, and directed her complaint towards Allah. And Allah has heard the discussions the two of you had. Indeed, Allah hears all and sees all","58:2":"Those who (swear and) declare their wives to be like their mothers (should know that) their wives are not their mothers. Of course, their mothers can only be those who gave them birth. What they utter is certainly condemned, and a lie. Allah is indeed the most Forgiving, the most Merciful","58:3":"Those who declare their wives to be like their mothers, and later wish to rescind their statement must free a slave before they may approach their wives. You are being cautioned against (making such statements). Allah is well Aware of what you do","58:4":"And the one who does not find (the resources to free a slave), must observe fasts daily for two consecutive months before the couple may touch each other. He who lacks the ability to fast should feed sixty poor people. This is so you may have faith in Allah and His messenger! These are the limits set by Allah. For the unbelievers there is a painful punishment","58:5":"Indeed, those who oppose Allah and His messenger are going to be disgraced, just like those before them (who opposed Allah). We have revealed clear proofs! There is a disgraceful punishment for the unbelievers","58:6":"That day Allah will resurrect them all, and He will tell them everything they had done. Allah has recorded everything, while they have forgotten. Allah is the witness to every single thing","58:7":"Do you not realize that Allah knows everything in the heavens and on earth? Never is there a secret conference of three, where He is not the fourth (listening in); nor of five, where He is not the sixth (listening). Even when there are less (than three) or more than that number (holding secret talks), He is (always) with them no matter where they might happen to be. Later, on the Day of Judgment, He will tell them everything they had done! Indeed, Allah knows every single thing","58:8":"Have you not seen those who were forbidden from engaging in intrigues and cabals? Yet they went back to doing (exactly) what they were forbidden (to do). They conspired to commit sins and wrongful acts, and to disobey the messenger. When they visit you, they greet you in a manner in which Allah did not greet you. (Mischievously, they twist words, as they salute you). In their hearts they say, \"Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?\" For them, hellfire is enough! They shall burn in it! What a despicable destination","58:9":"Oh those of you who believe, do not hold secret talks for the sake of committing sins and wrongful acts, and for the sake of disobeying the messenger. Rather, if you hold secret talks, let it be for (the sake of) piety and righteousness; and (above all) fear Allah, before Whom you would all be gathered","58:10":"Indeed, (these) secret (esoteric) communions are the work of the devil, (whose purpose is) to dishearten the believers. (But) without the sanction (and approval) of Allah, he cannot cause a bit of harm. The believers should place their trust in Allah (exclusively)","58:11":"Oh those of you who believe! Make room (for others) in the gatherings when you are asked to do so. Allah will make room for you (in the life-to-come). Get up when you are asked to rise.

Allah is well-Aware of what you do","58:12":"Oh those of you who believe, whenever you seek a private audience with the messenger, present something in charity (to the poor) prior to the consultation. This is better for you _ and purer. (Yet) if you are unable (to offer charity), then Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Kind","58:13":"Are you afraid of giving charity prior to your consultation with the messenger? So you may not _ and Allah forgives you for it _ (but) establish ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´ and obey Allah and His messenger. Allah is (well) Aware of what you do","58:14":"Do you not see the hypocrites? They befriend the nation that has invoked the wrath of Allah. They _ (such hypocrites) _ neither belong to you nor to others (your enemies). They knowingly swear to their falsehood","58:15":"Allah has prepared a severe punishment for them! Indeed, what they do is really evil","58:16":"They use their oaths as their shields, and they prevent people from the path of Allah. A disgraceful punishment is (in store) for them","58:17":"Their wealth and their children will not help them a bit against Allah! They are the people of the fire, and in it they shall stay forever","58:18":"On that day, Allah will raise them all (back to life), and they will swear before Him just like they swear before you (now). They will fancy that their oaths will bring them some benefits. Beware! They are certainly the liars","58:19":"Shaitan has gained mastery over them, and has caused them to become oblivious of the remembrance of Allah. They are the gang of Shaitan. Beware! The gang of Shaitan is definitely the loser","58:20":"Indeed, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger are the ones who would be the lowest and the most humiliated","58:21":"Allah has decreed, \"I and My messengers shall certainly prevail!\" Allah is the Strongest, and the most Powerful","58:22":"You will never see it happen, that folks who believe in Allah and the Day of Judgment (also) love those who oppose Allah and His messenger, even if they happen to be their fathers, sons, brothers or other relatives.

You never thought they would depart (without resistance). And they thought their strongholds would defend them against Allah. But Allah came upon them from where they least expected. He cast terror in their hearts, so they ruined their homes with their own hands, and the hands of the believers. So learn the lesson, Oh you, endowed with sights","59:3":"Had Allah not decreed (the life of) exile for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world. The punishment by fire is (in store) for them in the afterlife","59:4":"This is so, because they acted in defiance of Allah and His messenger. Whoever goes against (the will of) Allah (should know that) Allah is indeed very Severe in reprisal","59:5":"It was with Allah´s permission that you cut down (some of) the date palm trees and left (others) standing on their stems, in order that He might disgrace the evildoers","59:6":"Allah granted their possessions to His messenger, as spoils (of war). You did not throw your horses and your camels (in battle) against them. Allah gives dominance to His messenger over whatever He pleases. Allah is capable of (doing) everything","59:7":"The booty Allah granted to His messenger from the people of the town is for (the sake of) Allah, His messenger, the relatives (of the messenger), the orphans, the poor (and the needy), and the wayfarers; so that wealth may not get (hoarded) amongst your well to do. Accept what the Messenger grants you and stay away from what he forbids! Fear Allah.

They help (the cause of) Allah and His messenger! Such are truly the faithful ones","59:9":"And the booties are for those who had houses (in the city) and had accepted the faith before others. (Because) they really love the immigrants who were driven out of their homes and came to them (for help). They do not entertain any greed in their hearts for what others have been given. They prefer others over themselves, even though they are poor. Those who escape the greed within their own hearts, are really the successful ones","59:10":"Those who followed them (in faith) say, \"Our Lord!

We will come to your aid if war is waged upon you.\" Allah bears witness that they are surely the liars","59:12":"Very definitely! If they, (the people of the book), are banished, the hypocrites will not depart with them. If they, (the people of the book), are attacked, the hypocrites will not come to their aid. They (the hypocrites) will turn their backs (and desert their allies), if they (at all) come to their aid. No help shall they receive, then","59:13":"Indeed, in their hearts they fear you much more than they fear Allah. This is so because they are a nation that does not comprehend","59:14":"They will not unite to fight you as a single force, except in fortified villages or from behind walls. Their enmity and aversion for each other is intense. You consider them united, but their hearts are divided! This is so because they are a nation that does not understand","59:15":"They are (exactly) like their immediate predecessors who tasted the evil result of their conduct. A painful punishment is (in store) for them","59:16":"(The hypocrites are) like Shaitan! He suggests to man, \"Refute the truth! (be ungrateful)!\" But as soon as man denies the truth, (Shaitan) says, \"I am absolved of your sins! Indeed, I fear Allah, the Lord of the universe","59:17":"The final outcome would be: both of them _ (Shaitan the enticer, and the man accepting his suggestion) _ would be (thrown) in the fire. Both would live there forever! And that is the befitting treatment for the evildoers","59:18":"Oh you who believe, fear Allah! Each one should take stock!

You secretly show them affection! I know what you conceal and what you declare! Whoever amongst you does that, has really left the straight path and has gone astray","60:2":"They would treat you as their enemies, if they were to gain an upper hand over you.

Upon You we rely and towards You we turn in repentance! Towards You is our journey back","60:5":"Our Lord, do not turn us into a test for the unbelievers, and forgive us our Lord!

Deal with them justly. Allah loves those who are just","60:9":"But Allah forbids you to befriend those who fought against you over matters of faith, those who either assisted others in driving you out of your homes or drove you out themselves. Those of you who befriend them are indeed the evil doers","60:10":"Oh those of you who believe, investigate (all) immigrant women who come to you, claiming to be the believers. Allah knows better, whether or not they believe. If you determine that they (really) are the believers, then do not repatriate them back to their non-believing husbands (or family). The believing women are not lawful for the non-believing men; nor are the non-believing men lawful for the believing women. Return to their non-believing husbands whatever they had spent (as nuptial dowry). You would not be committing a sin, if you marry such women, provided you pay them their due. Do not keep the non-believing women married to you. Ask them to return what you had spent upon them (as nuptial dowry). Let the non-believing husbands (likewise) receive the amounts they had spent on their (believing) wives. This is the command of Allah!

Provided, they pledge that they would not join any partners with Allah, would not steal, commit adultery or kill their children, and would not indulge in slander, and would not concoct lies on their own. Also, that they would not disobey you in what is right. Seek forgiveness for them from Allah! Certainly Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful","60:13":"Oh you who believe! Do not befriend the people who have incurred the wrath of Allah. Just like the disbelievers lying in their graves, they too have abandoned all hope about the afterlife","61:1":"Everything in the heavens and on earth chants His praises; He is the Mightiest, the Wisest","61:2":"Oh you who believe, why do you say that which you do not (intend to) do","61:3":"It is greatly despised by Allah that you should say something, and then not do it","61:4":"Indeed, Allah loves those who fight in His path, organized and arrayed as if they were a single solid structure","61:5":"(Remember), when Musa said to his people, \"Oh my people, why do you annoy and irritate me? You already know that I am really the messenger of Allah for you!\" (But) when they deviated (from the truth), Allah made their hearts turn further away (from the truth). Allah does not guide the sinful people","61:6":"And (remember) when Jesus son of Mary said, \"Oh children of Israel, I have really been appointed the messenger of Allah towards you.

If you (must) divorce your women, divorce them for a (prescribed) period. Count the period (correctly). Fear Allah, your Lord, and do not _ unless they have committed a flagrantly immoral act _ expel your divorced women out of their homes. The women too should not leave their homes. These are the confines of Allah. Anyone overstepping the limits of Allah actually commits an outrage upon himself. You do not know! (During that period), Allah may well bring about something (to cause reconciliation between the husband and wife)","65:2":"At the end of the (prescribed) period, either hold back your women (in wedlock) lawfully, according to the well-known (prescribed) manner, or make the divorce final in accordance with the well known (prescribed) way. Take two of your fair minded (and respected) men as your witnesses. (Oh witnesses)! Bear the witness truthfully for the sake of Allah! Those who believe in Allah, and the life-to-come, are hereby being asked to heed. Allah will provide a way out for the one who fears Him","65:3":"And, He would grant the bounties (and provisions) from sources they had not expected (or even imagined). Allah is sufficient for anyone who places his trust in Him. (Always, and without an exception), Allah brings His decrees to destiny. Indeed, Allah it is Who has appointed the destiny for every single thing","65:4":"(Remember), if you are in doubt about the ´iddat.´ of your women, _ either because they are past the age, or haven´t yet started to menstruate _ it lasts three months. The ´iddat´ for the pregnant women (is three months, or it) lasts till the termination of pregnancy. (iddat: the period after divorce during which a woman is forbidden to remarry). Allah (grants a leeway and) makes matters easy for the one who fears Him","65:5":"This is the commandment of Allah; He has revealed it to you. Whoever fears Him (and practices righteousness and restraint), Allah will cleanse him of his sins (and rid him of his faults and flaws); and Allah will magnify his rewards","65:6":"(During the period of ´iddat´) have the (divorced) women live where you live, as your resources allow. Do not abuse and mistreat them, in order to harass them. If they happen to be carrying (your) child, then spend and bear their expenses till they carry their pregnancies to term. If they are nursing (your child), then compensate them in a fair and equitable manner. Settle the issue (of compensation) between you and your (former) wives amicably. Should the matter (of compensation) be difficult (and hard to resolve), then any other woman may nurse the child","65:7":"Let the well-to-do spend according to his means, and let the one with limited resources spend according to what Allah has granted him. Never does Allah obligate anyone in excess of what He has granted him. Allah may soon change the difficult circumstances into (leisure and) comfort","65:8":"So many communities (in the past) have been insolent and arrogant towards the commandments of their Lord, and His messengers. So, very harshly We called them to account. We inflicted upon them a severe punishment","65:9":"They tasted the evil consequences of their conduct. The final outcome of their conduct was (nothing but) sheer loss","65:10":"For them, Allah has prepared the severest (most awful) punishment.

(There), Allah has (kept in store) excellent (and everlasting) bounties for him","65:12":"Allah has created the seven heavens. And the same goes for the earth! The commands (of Allah) prevail over all of them (constantly). So that you may know (for sure), that Allah is capable of doing everything; and that Allah has (full and unabridged) knowledge of every single thing","66:1":"Oh prophet! Why did you, in order to please your wives, forbid yourself that which Allah has deemed lawful for you? Allah is all-Forgiving, the most Merciful","66:2":"Allah has prescribed a procedure for you to expiate (and rescind) such oaths. Allah is your Patron; He is the most Knowledgeable, the Wisest","66:3":"(Remember)! The prophet confided in one of his wives concerning a certain matter. When she divulged (the information) to another one (of his wives), Allah informed the prophet about it. The prophet told his wife a portion (of what Allah had informed him) and ignored the rest. When he told her about it, she asked, \"Who told you about this?\" He replied, \"The One Who knows all and is the most Aware has told me","66:4":"(Oh wives of the prophet), the two of you better turn to Allah and repent. Your hearts have wandered off the right path. But if you back each other against the prophet, then (beware)! Allah is certainly his friend! And so are the angel Gibraeel, and all the righteous believers. Besides that, all the angels are his supporters","66:5":"In case the prophet divorces you all, his Lord would perhaps grant him other wives _ widows or maidens, in your place. They would be better than you, more obedient, believing, pious, penitent and fond of fasting","66:6":"Oh you who believe, save yourselves and your families from the fire. Humans and stones are its fuel! Burly and rigidly fierce angels are (appointed as guards) over it. They do not disobey or disregard any of the commands of Allah. (Rather), they (diligently) carry out whatever they are commanded","66:7":"Oh you unbelievers! Do not make excuses today. You are being punished only for what you have (actually) done (and nothing else)","66:8":"Oh you believers! Turn to Allah in repentance, an earnest (and heartfelt) repentance. Allah, your Lord, may just rid you of your sins (and your faults and flaws); He will usher you into paradise, through which run the rivers. Allah will not let the prophet and those who believe in him, be humiliated on that day. The light (emanating from them) would run in front of, and to the right of them. They shall call out, \"Our Lord, (please) complete for us our light, and forgive us. Indeed, You have power over all things","66:9":"Oh prophet! Wage a relentless struggle against the unbelievers, and the hypocrites. Be stern against them (and do not yield). Hell shall be their abode! What an evil (despicable) destination","66:10":"For the unbelievers, Allah cites the case of the wives of the prophets ´Nooh´ and ´Loot´. They were married to two of Our most honorable and righteous servants. But they betrayed their husbands, and so their husbands could not help them against Allah at all. Both of these women were ordered to enter the hellfire just like all the others who (deserved to enter hell, and) would live there for ever","66:11":"And for the believers. Allah cites the example of the pharaoh´s wife. She said, \"Lord, (please) build me a house in paradise under your (auspicious) care. Save me from the pharaoh and his (evil) deeds, and save me from (such) an unjust nation","66:12":"(And the example of) Mary, a daughter Imran, who had (rigidly) guarded her chastity.

He is capable of accomplishing everything","67:2":"(Blessed is) the One Who created the death and life, so He may try and test you; which of you performs the better deeds. He is the most Powerful, and the most Kind","67:3":"The One Who created seven tiers of heavens, one atop another! You do not find any disparity or disharmony in the creation of Rehman, (the most Merciful). Cast another look! Do you find any breach (in the heavens)","67:4":"(Go ahead)! Look again and again. Your eyes would wear out, and your sight would (wander and) return to you, bewildered and in vain","67:5":"We have embellished the heaven nearest to this world with (numerous) lamps (the stars). We have made this heaven (a means) to bombard the Shaitan with missiles, to drive them away. For them, We have prepared a punishment by the blazing fire","67:6":"There exists a punishment of hell for those who refuse to believe in their Lord. Theirs is a despicable destination","67:7":"As they are hurled into hell, they would hear it shriek and scream (in anger); it would boil over furiously, as it blazes","67:8":"It would almost explode in its frenzied fury. As a fresh crop (of sinners) is flung into hell, its warden would ask, \"(How did you end up here)? Hadn´t a warner come to you","67:9":"They would reply, \"Yes! A warner had indeed come to us, but (alas)! We rejected him and said: \"Allah has revealed nothing! You have just (blundered and) slumped into a grave error","67:10":"They would say, \"Had we listened (attentively), or applied our mind, we would have escaped being the inmates of the blazing fire","67:11":"Thus, they would confess their sins; damned are the inmates of the fiery flames","67:12":"Forgiveness and a rich reward exists for those who fear their Lord, though they do not see Him","67:13":"(Little does it matter whether you) whisper your words in secret, or shout them out aloud! He is indeed aware of everything, (every thought) that passes through the heart","67:14":"Why would He not know? He is the Creator!

That it will not suddenly begin to rock (as in an earthquake)","67:17":"Are you unafraid that He _the One in heaven, (Allah) _will not unleash a violent hurricane upon you? Then you would learn in a hurry how (true and terrible) was My warning","67:18":"Of course, (most of) their predecessors had (also) refused to believe. So (observe), how (devastating) was My wrath (and punishment)","67:19":"Do they not look at the birds above them? They flap and fold their wings (and fly)! No one but Rehman, (the Merciful), holds them up (in mid air). Indeed He is the One watching over every single thing","67:20":"Do you have an army that can support you against the Merciful (Lord)? In fact, the unbelievers are just duped by a delusion","67:21":"If He withholds His bounties from you, do you have anyone else who could grant you the provisions? The fact is, they hide behind their pride, and their (irrational) aversion (to the truth)","67:22":"So who (do you think) is better guided? The one crawling on his face groping (to find his way), or the one walking upright along the straight path","67:23":"Say, \"It is He Who brought you into being, and conferred upon you (the faculties of) hearing, sight and reasoning.
