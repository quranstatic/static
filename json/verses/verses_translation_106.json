No, but God cursed them for their disbelief, and a few of them believe (or they believe a little)","2:89":"And when a book came to them from God confirming what is with them, even though previously they used to ask for victory over those who disbelieved, then when what they recognized came to them, they disbelieved in it.

Solomon did not disbelieve but the devils disbelieved, teaching people witchcraft and what was sent down to the two angels in Babylon, Harut and Marut. But neither of the two teaches anyone before saying: we are only a temptation, do not disbelieve. So they learn from them what causes separation between the man and his wife. But they did not harm anyone with it except by God’s permission. And they learn things that harm them and have no benefit for them. And they certainly knew that whoever buys it (witchcraft) there will be no share for him in the hereafter.

And God does not like any disbelieving sinner","2:277":"Those who believed and did good works and performed the mandatory prayer and gave the mandatory charity will have their reward with their Master and they have no fear and no sadness","2:278":"You who believe, be cautious of God and leave what is left of the usury if you are believers","2:279":"If you do not do it (stop usury), then be informed about a war from God and His messenger, and if you repent (from usury) then your principal capital is yours, you will not be wrong and you will not be wronged","2:280":"And if he (the debtor) is having difficulty (financially or otherwise) then postpone until it is easy (for him to repay), and if you are charitable (and forgive the loan) it is better for you if you knew","2:281":"And be cautious of a day when you are returned to God in it, then every person is paid back (in full) for what they earned, and they will not be wronged","2:282":"You who believe, when you borrow from each other for a limited period, then write it (to have a record). And let a writer write it (the loan details) between you in justice. A writer should not refuse to write as God taught him. So he shall write, and the borrower should dictate, and he should be cautious of God, his Master, and should not reduce (or eliminate) anything from it. And if the borrower is retarded or is a child or is unable to dictate, then his guardian should dictate in justice. And ask two witnesses from among your men to witness, and if there are not two men, then one man and two women from the witnesses who are acceptable to you, so if one of the two makes a mistake (or forgets) then the other one of the two may remind the other one. And the witnesses should not refuse (to testify) if they are called upon. And they should not be reluctant to write it no matter how small or large, along with its term. This is fairer in God’s view, and more upstanding for the testimony, and closer that you do not have doubts. Except if it is a face to face transaction that (the actual merchandise or money) changes hands between you, then there will be no blame on you if you do not write it. And take witness when you buy and sell. And the writer and the witness should not be harmed, and if you do (harm them) it is indeed disobedience on your part. And be cautious of God, and God teaches you (what to do). God knows everything","2:283":"If you are traveling and cannot find a writer then take collateral. And if some of you entrusts (a trust to) another, then the trustee should return the trust and he should be cautious of God, his Master. And do not hide (or withhold) the testimony, and anyone who hides it then he is indeed a sinner at heart. And God knows what you do","2:284":"Everything in the skies and on the earth belongs to God, and whether you disclose what is in yourself or you hide it, God holds you accountable for it, and He forgives whom He wants and punishes whom He wants. God is capable of everything","2:285":"The messenger believed in what was sent down to him by his Master, and all the believers believed in God and His angels and His books and His messengers, (saying) we do not differentiate between any of His messengers, and they said: we heard and we obeyed, (we ask for) Your forgiveness our Master, and the final return is to You","2:286":"God does not task any person beyond its capability, whatever (good) it does is for it, and whatever (bad) it does is against it. Our Master, do not hold it against us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Master, do not impose a burden on us as you imposed it on those before us. Our Master, do not impose on us what we cannot bear it and excuse us and forgive us and have mercy on us, You are our protector (and guardian), so help us against the disbelieving people","3:1":"L.M. (Alif. Lam. Mim)","3:2":"God, there is no god except Him, the living and the eternal","3:3":"He sent down the book to you with the truth confirming what was before it and He sent down the Torah and the Gospel","3:4":"in the past as a guide for the people, and He sent down the criterion. Indeed those who disbelieved in God’s signs, a severe punishment is for them. God is powerful and revengeful","3:5":"Nothing is hidden from God on the earth and in the skies","3:6":"He is the One who shapes you in the wombs as He wants. There is no god except Him, The powerful and the wise","3:7":"He is the One who sent down the book to you, of which some verses are firm and they are the basis of the book, and others are metaphorical. As for those who have perversion in their hearts, they follow the metaphorical ones of it, wishing for disorder and looking for its interpretation, while no one except God knows their interpretation. And the scholars of knowledge say: we believe in it, all of it is from our Master. But only the people of understanding (reasonable people) take notice","3:8":"Our Master, do not let our hearts deviate after You guided us, and give us mercy from Your presence. You are the giver","3:9":"Our Master, You are gatherer of the people on the day that there is no doubt about it. God does not break the promise","3:10":"Those who disbelieved, their wealth and children will never benefit them against God. They are fuel for the fire","3:11":"Like habit of Pharaoh’s people and those before them, they denied Our signs, so God punished them for their sins. God is severe in punishment","3:12":"Tell those who disbelieved: you are going to be defeated and gathered together in hell, and it is a bad resting place","3:13":"Indeed there was a sign for you in the two groups that encountered (in the battle of Badr), a group was fighting in God's way, and the other disbelieved. They saw them twice as many, with their own eyes. God supports anyone He wants with His help. There is a lesson in this for those who have insight","3:14":"Love of the desires such as women and children and loads and loads of gold and silver and branded horses (of excellent breed) and the livestock and the crop was made attractive for the people. These are the enjoyments of this world’s life, while the best place to return is with God","3:15":"Say: shall I inform you about better than that? Those who control themselves will have with their Master gardens which rivers flow through them, remaining in there forever, and pure spouses and pleasure of God. God sees His servants","3:16":"those who say: our Master, we believed, forgive us our sins, and protect us from the punishment of the fire","3:17":"the patients (and persevering) and the truthful ones and the obedient ones and the spenders (in God's way) and the ones asking for forgiveness at the dawn","3:18":"God and the angels and those having knowledge testify that there is no god except Him, standing with the justice. There is no god except Him, the powerful and the wise","3:19":"Indeed, the way of life before God is submission (to Him), and those who were given the book did not disagree except after knowledge came to them, due to jealousy among them. And if anyone disbelieves in God’s signs, God is quick in accounting","3:20":"If they argue with you, say: I submitted my manner (of life) to God, and so did my followers. And say to those who were given the book and the illiterates: did you submit yourselves? If they submit then they are guided and if they refuse then your responsibility is only preaching. God sees His servants","3:21":"Those who disbelieve in God’s signs and kill the prophets unjustly and kill those among the people who order to justice, warn them of a painful punishment","3:22":"They are those whose works became useless in this world and in the hereafter, and there are no helpers for them","3:23":"Did you not see those who were given some benefit of the book, being invited to God's book to judge between them (in their disputes), then a group of them turned away and they opposed","3:24":"This is because they said: the fire will never touch us except for a few days. And what they were fabricating deceived them in their way of life","3:25":"And how will it be when We gather them on a day that there is no doubt in it and every person is paid back (in full) for whatever he earned and they will not be wronged","3:26":"Say: God, owner of the rule, You give the rule to anyone You want and You take away the rule from anyone You want, and You give honor (and dignity) to anyone You want and You humiliate (and disgrace) anyone You want, goodness is in Your hands, and You are capable of everything","3:27":"You make the night pass into the day and You make the day pass into the night, and You bring the living from the dead, and You bring the dead from the living, and You provide for anyone You want without any limit","3:28":"The believers shall not take disbelievers as their supporters (and protectors) in lieu of the believers. And whoever does this, then he is not on anything from God (and has nothing to do with Him), unless you cautiously protect yourself from them. And God warns you about Himself (and His punishment). And the final return is to God","3:29":"Say: whether you hide what is in your minds or you disclose it, God knows it. And He knows what is in the skies and what is on the earth. And God is capable of everything","3:30":"A day that every person finds, all the good it did and all the bad it did, present and wishes for a great distance between itself and between that. God warns you about Himself (and His punishment). God is gentle to His servants","3:31":"Say: if you love God, then follow me, so God will like you and will forgive your sins. God is forgiving and merciful","3:32":"Say: obey God and the messenger. But if they refuse then God does not like the disbelievers","3:33":"God chose Adam and Noah and Abraham’s family and Imran’s family above all other people","3:34":"Some were offspring of the others. God hears all and knows all","3:35":"(Remember) when Imran’s wife said: God, I pledge dedication of what is in my womb to You, so accept it from me, indeed You hear all and know all","3:36":"So when she gave birth to it, she said: God I gave birth to a girl, while God knew better what she gave birth to, and boy is not like girl, and I named her Mary and I place her and her children under your protection from the expelled Satan","3:37":"Her God accepted her with best acceptance, and raised her with good upbringing, and made Zachariah her guardian.

He (the angel) said: it is like that, God does what He wants","3:41":"He said: God, give me a sign. He said: your sign is that for three days you will only speak to people in sign language, and remember your Master often, and praise Him in the evening and the early morning","3:42":"And (remember) when the angels said: Mary, God chose you and made you chaste and chose you above all the women of humankind","3:43":"Mary, be obedient to your Master, and show humbleness, and bow down with those who bow down","3:44":"This is among the stories of the unseen that we reveal to you. You were not with them when they were drawing their ballots that which one will be the guardian of Mary, and you were not with them when they were disputing","3:45":"(Remember) when the angels said: Mary, God indeed gives you the good news with a word from Him, his name is Jesus Christ, son of Mary, respected in this world and in the hereafter, and one of the close ones (to God)","3:46":"And he speaks to the people from the cradle to old age, and he is of the righteous","3:47":"She said: my Master, how could I have a son when no human being has touched me?

And God hears all and knows all","5:77":"Say: people of the book, do not exaggerate unjustifiably in your religion (way of life), and do not follow the desires of people who were lost in the past and misguided many and lost the even (right) way","5:78":"Those who disbelieved among children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus, son of Mary. That is because they disobeyed and they used to exceed the limits","5:79":"They were not stopping one another from unacceptable which they did it. What they were doing was indeed bad","5:80":"You see many of them turning (for support) to those who disbelieved. Indeed what their own self sent ahead for them was bad, to make God angry with them and they remain in punishment forever","5:81":"And if they had believed in God and the prophet and what was sent down to him, they would not have taken them as supporters but most of them are disobedient","5:82":"You shall find that the people with most animosity for those who believed are the Jewish and those who associated (polytheists), and you shall find nearest of them to friendship for those who believed are those who say we are Christians, that is because among them are priests and monks, and they are not arrogant","5:83":"And when they listen to what was sent down to the messenger, you see their eyes are full of tears because of what they recognized from the truth, they say: our Master, we believe so write us with the witnesses","5:84":"And why should we not believe in God and what came to us from the truth, and we hope for our Master to admit us with the righteous people","5:85":"So because of what they said, God gave them gardens which rivers flow through them remaining in there forever, and that is reward of the good doers","5:86":"And those who disbelieved and denied our signs, they are inhabitants of the hellfire","5:87":"You who believe, do not make good things that God made lawful for you unlawful, and do not exceed the limits. God does not like those who exceed the limits","5:88":"And eat from good lawful things that God provided for you, and be cautious of God, the One you believe in Him","5:89":"God does not hold you responsible for your useless oaths, but He holds you responsible for your binding oaths. Then its penalty is to feed ten needy with the average of what you feed your family or to clothe them or to free a slave, and anyone who did not find then he should fast for three days. This is penalty of your oaths that you swore. And keep your oaths. That is how God clarifies His signs for you so you may be thankful","5:90":"You who believe, the wine (and alcoholic beverages) and the gambling and the statues (of idols) and the fortune-telling arrows are only filthy work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful","5:91":"Satan only wants to create animosity and hatred among you with the wine (and alcoholic beverages) and the gambling, and to keep you away from God's remembrance and the mandatory prayer, so will you stop it","5:92":"And obey God and obey the messenger and be careful. And if you turn away then know that Our messenger's responsibility is only the clear preaching (and delivering the message)","5:93":"There is no blame on those who believed and did good works for what they ate, when they were cautious and believed and did good works, then they were cautious and believed, then they were cautious and did good. And God loves the good doers","5:94":"You who believe, God shall test you with something of the hunt that is within the reach of your hands and your spears, so that God knows who fears Him secretly. So whoever exceeds the limits after that then there is a painful punishment for him","5:95":"You who believe, do not kill the game (in hunting) while you are forbidden (during the Hajj). Anyone of you who kills it intentionally, then his punishment is the livestock like what he killed, as judged by two just persons among you, as an offering to reach the Ka'aba, or penalty of feeding some needy or the equivalent of that in fasting, so he may taste the consequence of his action. God excuses what is passed, and anyone who returns (to such actions) then God revenges from him, and God is powerful and revengeful","5:96":"Hunting from the sea (fishing) and eating it was made lawful for you, as an enjoyment for you and for those who travel, while hunting in the land was forbidden to you as long as you are forbidden (during the Hajj). And be cautious of God, the One you will be gathered to Him","5:97":"God made the Ka’aba, the sacred house, a source of support and a safe station for the people, and so are the sacred months and the offering (of sacrifice) and the collared offerings. That is for you to know that God knows what is in the skies and what is in the earth, and God knows everything","5:98":"Know that God is severe in punishment, and that God is forgiving and merciful","5:99":"The responsibility of the messenger is only to preach, and God knows what you disclose and what you hide","5:100":"Say: the bad and the good are not equal even if abundance of the bad surprises you, so people of understanding (reasonable people) be cautious of God that you may be successful","5:101":"You who believe, do not ask about things that if they are disclosed to you, they upset you, and if you ask about them when Quran is being sent down, they will be disclosed to you, God excused it, and God is forgiving and patient","5:102":"A group (of people) before you have asked them, then they became disbelievers in them","5:103":"God did not make Bahirah or Sa'ibah or Wasilah or Hami (unlawful), but those who disbelieved attribute lies to God, and most of them do not understand","5:104":"And when they are told to come to what God sent down and to the messenger, they say what we found our fathers on it, is enough for us, even though their fathers did not know anything and they were not guided","5:105":"You who believe, you are responsible for yourselves, whoever is misguided does not harm you when you are guided. You all return to God, then He informs you of what you were doing","5:106":"You who believe, when the death gets to any of you, take two witnesses from just persons among yourself during making of the will, or from other than yourselves if you are traveling in the land and the tragedy of death hits you. If you have doubt, hold them after the mandatory prayer so they swear by God that: we will not sell it for any price even if it is for our relatives (or close ones), and we will not hide God’s testimony, in that case we will be among the sinners","5:107":"And if it is discovered that they are guilty of sin (for lying or betrayal) then let two others stand in their position, from those who are more deserving than the previous two, and swear by God that: our testimony is truer than their testimony and we did not overstep (the truth), otherwise we are among the wrongdoers","5:108":"That is more likely that they give the testimony correctly or they fear that their oaths will be disproved after other oaths. And be cautious of God and listen. And God does not guide the disobedient people","5:109":"On a day that God gathers the messengers and says: how were you responded? They say: we do not know, indeed You are knower of the unseen","5:110":"And when God said: Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favor upon you and your mother when I supported you with the Holy Spirit and you spoke with the people in the cradle and in old age, and when I taught you the book and the wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel, and when you made something from the clay in the shape of a bird with My permission, then you blew into it and it became a (real) bird with My permission, and you healed the born blinds and the lepers with My permission, and when you brought back the dead (to life) with My permission, and when I withheld children of Israel from you when you brought them the clear proofs but the disbelievers among them said: this is nothing but obvious magic","5:111":"And when I revealed to the apostles to believe in Me and in My messenger, they said: we believe, and be witness that we are submitted","5:112":"When the apostles said: Jesus, son of Mary, can your Master send down a table for us from the sky? He (Jesus) said: be cautious of God if you are believers","5:113":"They said: we want to eat from it and to reassure our hearts and to know that you have told us the truth and to be among the witnesses for it","5:114":"Jesus, son of Mary said: God, our Master, send down a table to us from the sky so it will be a feast for the first of us to the last of us and a sign from You, and provide for us as you are the best of the providers","5:115":"God said: I send it down to you, then anyone among you who disbelieves after that, I punish him, a punishment that I have not punished anyone else among humankind","5:116":"And when God said: Jesus, son of Mary, did you tell the people: take me and my mother as two gods besides God? He (Jesus) said: You are flawless, it is not for me to say what I have no right, if I had said it You would have known that, You know what is in my mind, but I do not know what is in Your mind, indeed You are knower of the unseen","5:117":"I did not tell them except what you instructed me to it, that serve God, my Master and your Master, and I was a witness over them as long as I was among them, and when You took me back, You became the observer over them, and You are witness to everything","5:118":"If You punish them, indeed they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, indeed You are the powerful and the wise","5:119":"God said: this is a day that the truthful benefit from their truthfulness, for them there are gardens which rivers flow through them, remaining in there forever and ever.

Say: to God. He prescribed the mercy upon Himself. He shall gather you on the resurrection day, that there is no doubt about it. Those who lost their souls do not believe","6:13":"And whatever inhabits in the night and in the day belongs to Him, and He hears all and knows all","6:14":"Say: should I take a protector other than God, creator of the skies and the earth, and He feeds and He is not fed? Say: indeed I am ordered to be the first of (or the best of) the ones who submitted and not to be of the polytheist","6:15":"Say: indeed I am afraid of the punishment of a great day if I disobey my Master","6:16":"Anyone whom (punishment) is kept away from him on that day, indeed He had mercy on him, and that is the clear victory","6:17":"And if God touches you with a harm then no one can eliminate it except Him, and if He touches you with good (no one can hold it back), He is capable of everything","6:18":"He is the dominant over His servants, and He is the wise and the well aware","6:19":"Say: what thing is greatest testimony? Say: God, a witness between me and you, and this Quran was revealed to me in order that I warn you and whoever it reaches with it. Do you testify that there are other gods with God?

Their account is not on you at all and your account is not on them at all, so if you drive them away then you are of the wrongdoers","6:53":"And that is how We tested some of them by the others, so that they say: are these the ones whom God favored upon them among us? Does not God know the thankful ones better","6:54":"And when those who believe in Our signs come to you, say: peace (and well-being) upon you. Your Master prescribed the mercy for Himself, that anyone of you who did something bad out of ignorance then he repented afterward and straightened out, He is indeed forgiving and merciful","6:55":"And that is how We explain the signs, in order to expose way of the guilty ones","6:56":"Say: I am forbidden to serve those you call on other than God. Say: I do not follow your desires, then I have lost (the right path) and will not be of the guided","6:57":"Say: I am on a clear proof from my Master while you deny that, what you want to rush it is not with me (in my power), the decision (and making rule) only belongs to Go, He tells the truth and He is best of the deciders","6:58":"Say: if what you want to hurry about it was with me then the matter was decided between me and you, and God best knows the wrongdoers","6:59":"And keys of the unseen are with Him and no one knows it except Him, and He knows what is in the land and in the sea and no leaf falls unless He knows about it, and there is no seed in darkness of the earth, and nothing wet and nothing dry unless it is in a clear book","6:60":"He is the One who takes you at night (during sleep) and knows what you did during the day, then He raises you in it until a limited time is finished, then your return is to Him, then He informs you of what you were doing","6:61":"He is dominant over His servants, and He sends guardians for you until when the death comes to one of you and Our messengers (angels) take him back, and they do not fall short","6:62":"Then they are returned to God, their true protector/master.

And remind with it that a person is subjected to punishment (or is disgraced) by what it does and it has no protector and no mediator other than God, and if it offers as compensation all compensations, it would not be taken from it. They are those who are subjected to punishment (or are disgraced) for what they did. There is drink of boiling water and a painful punishment for them because of what they used to disbelieve","6:71":"Say: should we call on other than God, that which does not benefit us and does not harm us, and to be turned on our heels (to disbelief) after God guided us, like someone whom the devils infatuated and left him baffled on the earth, and he has companions who invite him to the guidance (saying): come to us.

But when it disappeared he said: if my Master does no guide me, I will be of the misguided people","6:78":"And when he saw the sun rising, he said: this is my Master, this is greater.

He said: do you argue with me about God while He has guided me, and I am not afraid of what you associate with Him, unless my Master wants anything, my Master’s knowledge includes everything, will you not take notice","6:81":"And why should I fear what you associate (with God), while you do not fear associating (partners) with God when He did not sent down any reason for that to you. So which of the two groups has more right to safety, if you knew","6:82":"Those who believed and did not mix up their belief with wrongdoing, they are those who have safety and they are guided","6:83":"And that is Our reason that We gave Abraham against his people. We raise ranks of anyone We want. Your Master is indeed wise and knowledgeable","6:84":"And We gave him Isaac and Jacob, We guided them all, while previously We guided Noah, and among his descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron.

Say: I do not ask any wages for it, this (Quran) is only a reminder for humankind","6:91":"They did not value God, His true worth, when they said: God did not send down anything to any human being. Say: who sent down the book that Moses brought it, a light and guidance for the people? You put it on papers, disclosing some of it while hiding most of it, while you were taught what you and your fathers did not know. Say: God (sent it down). Then leave them playing in their useless discussions","6:92":"And this book (Quran), which We sent it down is blessed, confirming that which was before it, and so that you warn (the people of) the mother town (Mecca) and around it.

Look at its fruit when it bears fruit and it ripens. Indeed there are signs in that for people who believe","6:100":"They made partners of the Genie (Jinn) for God, while He created them, and they falsely attributed sons and daughters to Him without any knowledge.

Say: the miracles are only with God. And what makes you realize that even if it comes, they would not believe","6:110":"And We turn over their hearts and their eyes, as they did not believe in it the first time, and We leave them wandering in their rebellion","6:111":"Had We sent down the angels to them, and the dead spoke to them, and gathered everything in front of them, they would not have believed unless God wanted, but most of them are ignorant","6:112":"And like that We appointed for every prophet as enemy, humans and Jinn devils, inspiring each other the fancy word as a deception.

Those who earn the sin are going to be punished for what they used to commit","6:121":"And do not eat form what God’s name was not mentioned on it, and it is certainly disobedience. And the devils certainly inspire their friends to argue with you, and if you obey them, you are certainly polytheists","6:122":"Or, is someone who was dead and We made him alive and put a light for him to walk among the people with it, like someone who was in the darkness and cannot come out of it? That is how what they were doing was beautified for the disbelievers","6:123":"And that is how We placed in every town its greatest criminals to plot in it. And they do not plot except against themselves, and they do not realize","6:124":"And when a sign came to them, they said: we will never believe until we are given same as what was given God's messengers. God knows best where to place His message. Those who are guilty are going to suffer lowliness before God and a severe punishment for what they were plotting","6:125":"So anyone whom God wants to guide him, He opens his chest to submission, and whoever He wants to misguide him, He makes his chest tightly closed as if he climbs up to the sky. This is how God puts the filth on those who do not believe","6:126":"This is straight path of your Master. We have explained in detail the signs for people who take notice","6:127":"For them is the peaceful home with their Master, and He is their protector because of what they were doing","6:128":"And on a day that He gathers them all (saying): you clan of the Jinn, you have seduced many human beings. And their friends among the human beings say: our Master, some of us profited from others, and we reached our appointed time that You appointed for us. He says: the fire is your residence, remaining in there forever unless God wants (to save you). Your Master is indeed wise and knowledgeable","6:129":"And that is how We make some of the wrongdoers support the others for what they were doing","6:130":"You clan of Jinn and humans, did not messengers from among you come to you telling you My signs, and warning you about the meeting of this day of yours? They say: we testify against ourselves. And this world's life deceived them, and they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers","6:131":"That is because your Master is not destroyer of the towns wrongfully (or for their wrongdoing) while their inhabitants are unaware","6:132":"And for everyone is ranks according to what they did, and your Master is not unaware of what they do","6:133":"And your Master is rich (and without any needs) and full of mercy. If He wants, He destroys you and replaces you with what He wants, just as He produced you from other people’s descendants","6:134":"Indeed what you are promised certainly comes, and you cannot escape it","6:135":"Say: my people, do what you are capable of, and I do (what I can), and you will know who has the home of the hereafter. Indeed the wrongdoers do not succeed","6:136":"And they put aside a share for God from the crops and the livestock that He created, and they said by their claim that this is for God and this is for our partners (of God). Then what was for their partners (of God) did not reach God, but what was for God reached their partners. What they judge is bad","6:137":"And that is how their partners (of God) made the killing of their children attractive for many of the polytheists, to ruin them and to confuse them about their way of life. And if God wanted, they would not have done it. So leave them and what they fabricate","6:138":"They said by their claim that these livestock and crops are forbidden and no one should eat them except anyone we want, and livestock that (riding on) their back was forbidden, and livestock that they do not mention God's name over it, fabricating (lies) against Him. He is going to punish them for what they were fabricating","6:139":"And they said: what is in the wombs of these livestock is exclusively for our men and is forbidden to our women, but if it is dead (at birth) then they are partners in it. He is going to punish them for their assertion. Indeed He is wise and knowledgeable","6:140":"Those who foolishly killed their children without any knowledge, and forbade what God provided them fabricating (lies) against God, they have lost. They have erred and they were not guided","6:141":"And He is the One who created gardens trellised and non-trellised, and the dates and the produce with different taste, and the olives and the pomegranates, like and unlike. Eat from its fruit when it bears fruit, and gives its dues on the day of harvest, and do not be excessive, for indeed God does not like the excessive ones","6:142":"And among the livestock are transporting and covering. Eat from what God provided you and do not follow Satan's footsteps, indeed he is an obvious enemy for you","6:143":"Eight in pairs (four pairs), two of the sheep and two of the goats. Say: did He forbid the two males or the two females, or what is in the wombs of the two females? Tell me with knowledge if you are truthful","6:144":"And two of the camels and two of the cows. Say: did He forbid the two males or the two females, or what is in the wombs of the two females? Or were you present when God instructed you to this? Who is more wrong than someone who makes up a lie (and attribute it) to God to misguide people without any knowledge? Indeed God does not guide the wrongdoing people","6:145":"Say: I do not find, in what was revealed to me, anything forbidden to an eater who eats it, except if it is dead or poured out blood or meat of pig which is filthy or it is offered up for other than God which is indeed disobedience. And anyone who is forced without being desirous and not exceeding, then your Master is forgiving and merciful","6:146":"And to those who are Jewish, We forbade everything that have claws, and from the cows and from the sheep We forbade them their fat except what their backs carried or the intestines or what is mixed with bone. That is how We punished them for their aggression and We are certainly truthful","6:147":"If they denied you, then say: your Master has plenty of mercy, but His fury is not turned back from the guilty group","6:148":"Those who associate (partner with God) are going to say: if God wanted, we and our fathers would not have associate, and we would not have forbidden anything. That is how those before them lied until they tasted Our fury. Say: is there any knowledge with you, then bring it out for us, you follow nothing but the speculation and you only guess","6:149":"Say: the profound reason belongs to God, so if He wanted He would have guided you all","6:150":"Say: get your witnesses together, those who testify that God forbade this. If they testify, then do not testify with them, and do not follow the desires of those who denied Our signs and those who do not believe in the hereafter and they make equals with their Master","6:151":"Say: come, I read to you what your Master declared inviolable, do not associate anything with Him, and be good to your parent, and do not kill your children because of poverty as We provide for you and for them, and do not go near indecencies whether it is apparent or it is secret, and do not kill anyone except justifiably (in the due process of law) as God made it (life) sacred. This is what He instructed you to it, so that you may understand","6:152":"And do not go near property of the orphans except in the best way until he reaches his maturity, and give measure and weight with justice. We do not task any person beyond its capability. And when you speak, be just even if it is about your relatives (and close ones). And fulfill your promise to God. This is what He instructed you to it so that you may notice","6:153":"And this is My straight path, so follow it and do not follow other ways to separate you from His way. This is what He instructed you to it so that you may control yourselves","6:154":"We gave Moses the book to finish (our favor) upon the one who did good, and as an explanation for everything and a guide and a mercy so they may believe in meeting their Master","6:155":"And this book (Quran) which We sent it down is blessed, so follow it and be cautious (of God) so you may receive mercy","6:156":"That you do not say: the book was only sent down to two groups before us, and we were certainly unaware of their studies","6:157":"Or you do not say: if the book was sent down to us, we would have certainly been more guided than them. A clear proof and a guide and a mercy has come to you from your Master. So who is more wrong than someone who denies God’s signs and turns away from them? We are going to punish those who turn away from Our signs, a bad punishment for what they were turning away from","6:158":"Are they waiting that the angels come to them or your Master comes or some of your Master's signs come? A day that some of your Master's signs come, a person will not benefit from its belief if it did not believe from before or if it did not earn any good by its belief. Say: wait, indeed we are waiting too","6:159":"Indeed those who divided their religion and became sects, you have nothing to do with them. Their affair is only with God, then He informs them of what they were doing","6:160":"Whoever comes with a good deed, he has ten times as much as that, and whoever comes with a bad deed, then he is only punished like that, and they are not wronged","6:161":"Say: indeed my Master guided me to a straight path, a lasting way of life, the faith of monotheist Abraham, and he was not of the polytheists","6:162":"Say: indeed my mandatory prayer and my ritual and my life and my death are only for God, Master of humankind","6:163":"There is no partner for Him, and I am ordered to that, and I am the first of (or the best of) the submitted","6:164":"Say: shall I look for a Master other than God, while He is the Master of everything? And every person earns only against itself, and no bearer bears the burden of another, so your return is to your Master and then He informs you about what you used to disagree about it","6:165":"He is the One who made you successors on the earth, and raised some of you above others in ranks, to test you in what He gave you. Your Master is indeed quick in the punishment, and He is indeed forgiving and merciful","7:1":"L.M.S. (Alif. Lam. Mim. Sud)","7:2":"A book (Quran) was sent down to you, and there should not be any difficulty about it in your chest, to warn with it, and (it is) a reminder for the believers","7:3":"Follow what was sent down to you from your Master and do not follow any masters other than it/Him, you take a little notice","7:4":"And how many towns did We destroy, that Our punishment came to them by night or while they were resting (during daytime)","7:5":"When Our punishment came to them, their call was only to say: indeed we were wrongdoers","7:6":"We shall question those who (messengers) were sent to them, and We shall question the messengers","7:7":"And We shall tell them with knowledge (what they did), and We were not absent","7:8":"And on that day measuring will be true, and anyone whose measure is heavy then they are the successful ones","7:9":"And anyone whose measure is light then they are those who brought loss upon themselves because they used to be wrong to Our signs","7:10":"And We have certainly established you firmly on the earth, and We put means of life (and survival) for you in there. You give little thanks","7:11":"And We have certainly created you, then formed you, then We said to the angels: be humble to Adam. They all humbled except Iblis (Satan) who was not one of the humble ones","7:12":"He (God) said: what prevented you that you did not humble when I ordered you? He said: I am better than him, You created me from fire while You created him from clay","7:13":"He (God) said: go down from it, and it is not for you to be arrogant in it, so get out, you are of the belittled ones","7:14":"He (Satan) said: give me time until the day that they are raised","7:15":"He (God) said: indeed you are of those given a delay","7:16":"He (Satan) said: because you misled me, I shall sit for them in your straight path","7:17":"Then I shall come to them from in front of them and from behind them and from their rights and from their lefts, and you will not find most of them thankful","7:18":"He (God) said: get out of it disgraced and banished, those among them who follow you, I shall fill hell from all of you","7:19":"And you Adam, you and your spouse reside in the garden and eat from wherever you want, but do not get close to this tree because you become one of the wrongdoers","7:20":"And Satan seduced them both to make apparent to them what was hidden from them of their shame (of their genitals) and said: your Master only prohibited you from this tree so that you do not become angels or become immortals","7:21":"And he swore to them: I am indeed among the advisers for you","7:22":"And he made them fall by deception. Then when they both tasted the tree, their shame appeared to them and they began covering themselves with leaves of the garden, and their Master called them: did I not prohibit you from that tree and told you two that Satan is your clear enemy","7:23":"They both said: our Master, we did wrong to ourselves, and if you do not forgive us and have mercy on us, we shall be of the losers","7:24":"He (God) said: go down, some of you will be enemies of the others, and there is a settlement and necessities of life for you on the earth for a while","7:25":"He said: you live in it and you die in it and you will be brought out of it","7:26":"Children of Adam, indeed We sent down clothing to you to cover your shame and as a decoration, while the clothes of self control (against unlawful desires and sins) is better. That is among God's signs, so they may take notice","7:27":"Children of Adam, do not let Satan seduce you as he drove your parents out of the garden, stripping them off from their clothing to show them their shame. Indeed he and his tribe see you from where you do not see them. Indeed We made the devils friends (and masters) for those who do not believe","7:28":"And when they commit an indecency, they say: we found our fathers doing it and God ordered us to it. Say: God does not order to indecency, do you say about God what you do not know","7:29":"Say: my Master orders to justice. And turn your attentions (toward Him) in every place of worship and call on Him being sincere to Him in the religion. Just as He created you, you return (to Him)","7:30":"He guided some, and some deserved the misguidance. Indeed they took the devils as their friends (and masters) instead of God and they think they are guided","7:31":"Children of Adam, wear your beautiful thing at every place of worship and eat and drink, but do not be excessive as God does not like the excessive ones","7:32":"Say: who did forbid God's beautiful things and the good provisions that He produced for His servants? Say: in this world's life it is for those who believed, and exclusively theirs on the resurrection day. That is how We explain the signs for people who know","7:33":"Say: my Master only forbade the indecencies whether it is openly or it is in secret, and sins, and undue oppression, and that you associate with God that which He did not send down any reason for it, and that you say about God what you do not know","7:34":"For every group there is an appointed time (to believe), and when their appointed time comes they cannot put it back an hour nor put it forward","7:35":"Children of Adam, if messengers from among you come to you telling you My signs then anyone who controls himself and straightens out, then they have no fear and no sadness","7:36":"And those who denied Our signs and were arrogant about them, they are inhabitants of the fire remaining in there forever","7:37":"Who is more wrong than someone who makes up a lie (and attributes it) to God or denies His signs? They get their share from (what is written in) the book, so that when Our messengers (angels of death) come to them to take back their life, saying: where are those whom you were calling on besides God? They say: they abandoned us. And they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers","7:38":"Say: enter the fire among the communities of Jinn and humans who have passed away before you. Every time a group enters, its sister (that went in before it) curses it until they all get in there. The later ones say about the earlier ones: our Master, these misguided us, so give them double punishment of the fire. He (God) says: double for all, but you do not know","7:39":"And the earlier ones say to the later ones: there is no advantage for you over us, so taste the punishment for what you used to do","7:40":"Indeed gates of the heaven do not open for those who denied Our signs and were arrogant about them, and they do not enter the garden until a camel passes through the eye of the needle, and that is how We punish the guilty ones","7:41":"Their resting place is hell and above them is a covering, and that is how We punish the wrongdoers","7:42":"And those who believed and did good works are inhabitants of the garden remaining in there forever, We do not task any person beyond its capability","7:43":"And We remove whatever resentment that is in their chests, and beneath them rivers flow, and they say: all praise belongs to God, the One who guided us to this, and we were not guided if God did not guide us, certainly our Master's messengers have brought the truth. And they are called out that this is the garden that you inherited it for what you were doing","7:44":"And inhabitants of the garden call out inhabitants of the fire: we have found that what our Master promised us is true, so did you find what your Master promised is true? They say: yes. Then an announcer among them announced that God's curse is on the wrongdoers","7:45":"those who obstruct God's way and look for its distortion and they are disbelievers in the hereafter","7:46":"And between the two of them there is a barrier. And on the heights there are men who recognize everyone by their appearance, and they call out to inhabitants of the garden that have not entered it yet but they hope (to do so): peace (and well-being) upon you","7:47":"And when their eyes are turned towards inhabitants of the fire, they say: our Master, do not put us with the wrongdoing group","7:48":"And inhabitants of the heights call out men whom they recognize from their appearance saying: your population (and great number) and your being arrogant is of no use to you","7:49":"Are these the ones whom you swore that God does not grant them mercy? Enter the garden, you have no fear and you will not be sad","7:50":"And inhabitants of the fire call out inhabitants of the garden that send us some water or some of what God provided for you. They say: God forbade these to the disbelievers","7:51":"those who took their way of life as a play and an amusement and this world's life deceived them. Today, We forget them as they forgot about meeting of this day of theirs, and because they used to reject Our signs","7:52":"And We brought them a book which We explained it in detail based on knowledge, a guide and a mercy for believing people","7:53":"Are they waiting for its realization? A day that its realization comes, those who previously forgot it say: our Master's messengers brought us the truth, are there any mediators to mediate for us, or will we be sent back so that we do differently than what we were doing? Indeed they brought loss upon themselves and what they used to make up abandoned them","7:54":"Indeed your Master is God, the One who created the skies and the earth in six stages then He settled on the throne, He covers the day with the night, which it quickly looks for it, and the sun and the moon and the stars are governed by His command. Know that the creation and the command is His. Blessed is God, Master of humankind","7:55":"Call on your Master humbly and privately. He does not like those who exceed the limits","7:56":"And do not commit corruption on the earth after it is set in order, and call on Him in fear and in hope. God’s mercy is indeed close to the good doers","7:57":"He is the One who sends the wind as good news before His mercy, so that it carries heavy clouds, and We drive it to a dead land, then We send down the rain from it, then We bring out all kind of produce with it. That is how We bring out the dead (back to life), so that you may take notice","7:58":"And the good land brings out its plants with its Master’s permission, but the bad land only brings out sparsely. This is how We explain Our signs for thankful people","7:59":"We have certainly sent Noah to his people, and he said: my people, serve God, you have no god other than Him, indeed I am afraid of the punishment of a great day upon you","7:60":"The leaders of his people said: indeed we see you are clearly in error","7:61":"He said: my people, there is no error in me but I am a messenger from the Master of Human kind","7:62":"I preach you my Master's message and I advise you and I know from God what you do not know","7:63":"Or are you surprised that a reminder from your Master came to you, by a man from among you, to warn you and so that you control yourselves and you may receive mercy","7:64":"They denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the Ark and We drowned those who denied Our signs. They were a blind group","7:65":"And to (people of) Aad (We sent) their brother Hud, he said: my people, serve God, you have no god other than Him, will you not be cautious","7:66":"The leaders of those who disbelieved among his people said: indeed we see you are a fool and we think you are of the liars","7:67":"He said: my people, there is no foolishness in me, but I am a messenger from the Master of Human kind","7:68":"I preach you my Master's message and I am an honest adviser to you","7:69":"Or are you surprised that a reminder from your Master came to you, by a man from among you, to warn you? And remember when He made you successors after people of Noah and increased your stature in the creation. Remember God’s favor so you may be successful","7:70":"They said: did you come to us, so that we serve God alone, and give up what our fathers used to serve, so bring us what you promised us if you are truthful","7:71":"He (Hud) said: filth and anger from your Master have fallen on you, do you argue with me about names which you and your fathers named them, when God did not send down any reason for it? So wait and I wait with you","7:72":"So We saved him and those with him by a mercy from Us and We cut off the root of those who denied Our signs and they were not believers","7:73":"And to (people of) Thamud (We sent) their brother Salih. He said: my people, serve God, you have no god other than Him, a clear proof has come to you from your Master, this is God’s female camel, as a sign for you, so leave her to eat in God’s earth and do not harm her otherwise a painful punishment takes you","7:74":"And remember when He made you successors after Aad and settled you on the earth, where you build palaces in its plains and carve out houses in the mountains, so remember God’s favor, and do not commit mischief on the earth as corruptors","7:75":"The leaders of those who were arrogant among his people said to those who believed among those who were weak: do you know that Salih is sent by his Master? They said: we believe in what he was sent with it","7:76":"Those who were arrogant said: we disbelieve in what you believe in it","7:77":"Then they killed the female camel and disregarded order of their Master and said: Salih, bring us what you promised us (the punishment), if you are one of the messengers","7:78":"So the earthquake took them, and they became motionless bodies (and died) in their houses","7:79":"Then he (Salih) turned away from them and said: my people, I have certainly preached the message of my Master to you and advised you, but you do not like the advisers","7:80":"And (remember) Lot when he said to his people: do you commit the indecency that none of humankind did it before you","7:81":"Indeed you approach men lustfully instead of women. Yes, you are an excessive group","7:82":"The only answer of his people was that they said: drive them out of your town, indeed they are people who pretend to be (or want to remain) pure","7:83":"So We saved him and his family except his wife who was of those staying behind","7:84":"And We poured down a rain (of stone) on them. So see what the end of guilty ones was","7:85":"And to (people of) Midian (We sent) their brother Shu'aib. He said: my people, serve God, you have no god other than Him, a clear proof has come to you from your Master, so give full measure and weight and do not undervalue peoples' things and do not commit corruption on the earth after it is set in order, this is best for you if you are believers","7:86":"And do not sit on every road, threatening and obstructing God's way for anyone who believes in it, and look for its distortion. And remember when you were a few then he increased you, and see what the end of the corruptors was","7:87":"And if there is a group of you who believed in what I was sent with it, and a group who did not believe, then be patient until God judges between us, and He is the best of the judges","7:88":"The leaders of those who were arrogant among his people said: Shu'aib, we shall drive you and those who believed with you out of our town or you should return to our faith. He said: even if we were despising that","7:89":"We have made up a lie (and attributed it) to God if we returned to your faith after He saved us from that, and it is not for us to return to that, unless God our Master wants. Our Master’s knowledge includes everything. We trust in God. Our Master, decide between us and our people in truth, You are best of the deciders","7:90":"And the leaders of those who disbelieved among his people said: If you follow Shu'aib, then you would be losers","7:91":"So the earthquake took them, and they became motionless bodies (and died) in their houses","7:92":"Those who denied Shu'aib became as if they did not live in there. Those who denied Shu'aib, they were losers","7:93":"So he turned away from them and he said: my people, I have certainly preached my Master's message to you and advised you, so how can I be sorry for disbelieving people","7:94":"And We did not send any prophet to any town unless We took its resident in hardship and distress, so they may be humble","7:95":"Then We replaced the hardship with the comfort until they (thrived and) ignored (Us) and they said: the distress and the prosperity have touched our fathers too. So We suddenly took them without them realizing","7:96":"And if people of the towns had believed and controlled themselves, We would have certainly opened blessings of the sky and the earth to them, but they denied so We took them for what they were doing","7:97":"Do people of the towns feel safe that Our punishment will not come to them at night while they sleep","7:98":"Or do people of the towns feel safe that Our punishment will not come to them during daytime while they play","7:99":"Do they feel safe about God’s plan? Only the people who are losers feel safe about God’s plan","7:100":"Or does it not point out to those who inherited the earth after its (previous) people, that if We want We would make them suffer for their sins and would seal their hearts so they do not hear (the truth)","7:101":"These are the towns that we tell you their stories, and their messengers have certainly brought them the clear proofs, but they were not to believe in what they denied in the past. That is how God puts a seal on the hearts of the disbelievers","7:102":"And We did not find most of them (true) to their promise, and We found most of them to be disobedient","7:103":"Then after them, We sent Moses to Pharaoh and his assembly with Our signs, but they did wrong to them (Our signs), so see what the end of the corruptors was","7:104":"And Moses said: Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Master of Human kind","7:105":"It is my duty that I only say the truth about God, I have brought you clear proof from your Master, so send the children of Israel with me","7:106":"He (Pharaoh) said: if you brought a miracle, then bring it if you are truthful","7:107":"So he threw down his cane and it turned into a visible serpent","7:108":"And he took out his hand (from his vest) and it was white to the viewers","7:109":"The assembly of Pharaoh’s people said: he is a knowledgeable magician","7:110":"He wants to drive you out of your land, so what do you instruct","7:111":"They said: put him and his brother off (for a while) and send gatherers to the cities","7:112":"to bring you every knowledgeable magician","7:113":"The magicians came to Pharaoh and said: is there any reward for us if we are the winners","7:114":"He said: yes, and you shall be of the close ones (to me)","7:115":"They said: Moses, do you throw or are we the throwers","7:116":"He said: you throw. So when they threw, they bewitched people’s eyes and frightened them and they brought a great magic","7:117":"And We revealed to Moses: throw your cane, and it suddenly swallows whatever they fake","7:118":"So the truth was proved and whatever they were doing was invalidated","7:119":"So they were defeated there, and they turned belittled","7:120":"And the magicians fell, showing humbleness","7:121":"They said: we believed in the Master of Human kind","7:122":"Master of Moses and Aaron","7:123":"Pharaoh said: did you believe in Him before I give you permission? This is a plot which you planned in the city to drive its people out of it, but you will know (the consequences)","7:124":"I shall cut off your hands and feet from opposite (sides) then I shall crucify all of you","7:125":"They said: indeed we return to our Master","7:126":"you are only taking revenge from us because we believed in our Master’s signs when it came to us. Our Master, give us perseverance (and patience) and make us die as submitters","7:127":"And the assembly of Pharaoh’s people said: do you leave Moses and his people to commit corruption in the land and abandon you and your gods? He said: we are going to kill their sons and let their women live, and we are dominant over them","7:128":"Moses said to his people: ask God for help and persevere (and be patient), the earth belongs to God, He gives it as inheritance to whomever He wants among His servants, and the end is for those who control themselves","7:129":"They said: we were harassed before you come to us and after you came to us. He said: perhaps your Master destroys your enemy and make you the successors in the land to see how you do","7:130":"And We certainly took Pharaoh’s people by famine and shortage of the produce, so that they may take notice","7:131":"Then when something good came to them, they said: this is because of us. And when something bad happened to them, they attributed it to bad omen of Moses and those with him. Know that their bad omen is only from God but most of them do not know","7:132":"And they said: whatever miracle you bring us to bewitch us with it, we will not believe in you","7:133":"So We sent them the flood and the locusts and the gnat and the frogs and the blood, as distinct miracles, but they were arrogant and they were a guilty group","7:134":"And when the plague fell upon them, they said: Moses, call on your Master for us because of what He promised you, that if you remove the plague from us, then we shall believe in you and we shall send the children of Israel with you","7:135":"So when We removed the plague from them for a period of time which they reached it, then they break (their promise)","7:136":"So We took revenge from them and drowned them in the sea, because they denied Our miracles and they were negligent of them","7:137":"And We made the group who were weakened inherit east of the land and its west which We blessed it. And the good word (promise) of your Master fulfilled for the children of Israel because of their patience (and perseverance), and We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people were building and what (structures) they were erecting","7:138":"And We made the children of Israel cross the sea, then they came upon a group that worshiped their idols. They said: Moses, make a god for us like their gods. He said: indeed you are ignorant people","7:139":"indeed what these are (engaged) in it will be destroyed and what they are doing is useless","7:140":"He said: should I look for a god other than God for you, while He preferred you over all other people","7:141":"And (remember) when We saved you from Pharaoh’s people, who imposed the worst punishment on you, killing your sons and letting your women live. And in that there was a great test from your Master","7:142":"We made an appointment with Moses for thirty nights and We completed it with ten (more), so appointment of his Master completed in forty nights. And Moses told his brother Aaron: be my successor among my people (in my absence), and do right, and do not follow the way of the corruptors","7:143":"And when Moses came to Our appointment and his Master spoke to him, he said: my Master, show me (yourself) that I look at you. He (God) said: you will never see Me, but look at the mountain and if it stays in its place then you will see Me. So when his Master displayed Himself to the mountain, He pulverized it, and Moses fell unconscious, and when he woke up, he said: You are flawless, I repent to You, and I am the first (or the best) of the believers","7:144":"He (God) said: Moses, I chose you over the people with My message and with My word, so take what I gave you and be of the thankful ones","7:145":"And We wrote about everything on the tablets for him, an advise and an explanation of everything. So take them with strength and order your people to take it in the best manner. I am going to show you the home of the disobedient ones","7:146":"I am going to turn those who are unjustifiably arrogant on the earth away from My signs. And even if they see every miracle they would not believe in it, and if they see the right way, they would not take that way, while if they see the wrong way, they would take that way. That is because they denied Our signs and they were negligent of them","7:147":"And those who denied Our signs and the meeting of the hereafter, their works would become useless. Are they rewarded except for what they were doing","7:148":"And people of Moses, after him (in his absence), took (as god) a body of a calf made from their ornaments which made a sound. Did they not see that it does not speak to them and does not guide them to a way? They took it (as god), and they became wrongdoers","7:149":"And when they regretted and saw that they have made a mistake, they said: if our Master does not have mercy on us and forgive us, we shall be among the losers","7:150":"When Moses returned to his people, angry and sorrowful, he said: you succeeded me badly after me, were you rushing your Master’s order? He threw down the tablets and took his brother by the head dragging him toward himself. He (Aaron) said: son of my mother, the people weakened me and almost killed me, so do not make the enemies happy about me, and do not put me with the wrongdoing group","7:151":"He said: my Master, forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy, and You are the most merciful of the merciful ones","7:152":"Those who took the calf (as god) are going to receive their Master’s anger and humiliation in this world's life. That is how We punish those who make up lies (and attribute them to God)","7:153":"And those who did bad, then repented afterward and believed, indeed your Master is forgiving and merciful after that","7:154":"And when Moses' anger subsided, he took the tablets, and there was guidance and mercy in its text for those who were afraid of their Master","7:155":"And Moses selected seventy men from his people for Our appointment. So when the earthquake took them, he said: my Master, if You wanted, You could have destroyed them and me before this, do You kill us for what the fools among us did, this is only a test from You, misguiding anyone You want with it and guiding anyone You want, You are our protector (and supporter), so forgive us and have mercy on us, and You are the best of the forgivers","7:156":"And prescribe good in this world and in the hereafter for us, for we turned to You. He (God) said: I inflict My punishment on whomever I want, and My mercy includes everything, so I am going to prescribe it for those who control themselves and give the mandatory charity and those who believe in Our signs","7:157":"Those who follow the messenger (Muhammad), the illiterate prophet, the one they find him written in the Torah and the Gospel that is with them, he instructs them to what is right and prohibits them from what is wrong, and he makes the good thing lawful for them and prohibits them from the bad things, and he removes their burden and the shackles that is on them from them. So those who believed in him and assisted him and helped him and followed the light (Quran) that was sent with him, they are the successful ones","7:158":"Say: people, I am God's messenger to all of you, the One that the rule of the skies and the earth belongs to Him, there is no god except Him, He gives life and causes death. So believe in God and His messenger, the illiterate prophet, the one who believes in God and His words, and follow Him/him so that you may be guided","7:159":"And a group of Moses’ people guide to the truth, and they carry out justice with that","7:160":"And We divided them (children of Israel) into twelve tribes of nations, and We revealed to Moses when his people asked him for water: strike the stone with your cane. Then twelve springs flowed out of it, and all people knew their drinking place, and we shaded over them with the clouds, and We sent down the Manna and the Salwa (two kind of edible foods) to them. Eat from good things that We provided you. And they did not do wrong to Us, but they were wrong to themselves","7:161":"And (remember) when they were told: reside in this town and eat from it, wherever you want, and say: remove (and reduce our sins), and enter the gate humbly. I forgive your mistakes. We are going to increase the good doers","7:162":"But those who did wrong among them changed word to something other than what they were told, so We sent them a punishment from the sky because they used to do wrong","7:163":"Ask them about the town that was present by the sea, when they overstepped in Sabbath. When their fishes come to them appearing on the surface of the sea on their Sabbath day, and on non Sabbath days they would not come to them. That is how We tested them because they were disobeying","7:164":"And when a group of them said: why do you preach people whom God kills them or punishes them with a severe punishment? They said: as an apology to your Master and so that they may control themselves","7:165":"And when they forgot what they were reminded with it, We saved those who prohibited from the bad, and We took those who did wrong with a harsh punishment because they were disobeying","7:166":"And when they violated what they were prohibited from it, We told them: be driven away monkeys","7:167":"And (remember) when your Master declared that He shall raise against them those who inflict bad punishment on them until the resurrection day. Indeed God is quick in punishment and indeed He is forgiving and merciful","7:168":"And We divided them on the earth as nations. Some of them were righteous and some of them were other than that, and We tested them with the good and the bad so that they may return","7:169":"Then successors succeeded after them who inherited the book, taking material of this world and saying: it is going to be forgiven for us. And if material, same as that, comes to them, they take it (again). Was not the book’s commitment taken from them that they should not say anything about God except the truth, and they studied what is in it? The home of the hereafter is better for those who control themselves. Do you not understand","7:170":"And those who hold to the book and perform the mandatory prayer, indeed We do not waste the reward of the righteous","7:171":"And (remember) when We raised the mountain over them as if it was a canopy, and they thought that it falls on them, (We said): take what We gave you firmly and take notice of what is in it, so that you may control yourselves","7:172":"And (remember) when your Master took from the backs of the children of Adam, their descendants, and made them testify against themselves, (and He asked): am I not your Master? They said: yes, we testify. So that on the resurrection day you do not say: we were unaware of this","7:173":"Or you (would not) say: it was only our fathers who associated (partner with God) in the past, and we were descendents after them, do You destroy us for what the followers of falsehood did","7:174":"That is how We explain the signs, so that they may return","7:175":"And read to them story of the one whom We gave him Our signs, then he stepped away from it, so Satan followed him and he became of the deceived ones","7:176":"And If We wanted, We would have elevated him with it (Our signs), but he held on to the earth and followed his desires. His example is like the dog, if you attack it, it pants and if you leave it, it pants. That is example of the people who denied Our signs. So tell the stories, so that they may think","7:177":"The example of the people who denied Our signs and were wrong to themselves is awful","7:178":"Whoever God guides, then he is guided, and whoever He misguides, then they are the losers","7:179":"And We have certainly created many of Jinn and humans for hell. They have hearts that they do not understand with it, and they have eyes that they do not see with it, and they have ears that they do not hear with it. They are like animals, no they are even more lost. They are the negligent ones","7:180":"And the good names (and attributes) belong to God, so call on Him by them, and leave those who altercate about His names, they are going to be punished for what they were doing","7:181":"And among those whom We created, a group guides to the truth and they carry out justice with it","7:182":"And those who denied Our signs, We are going to gradually lead them (to destruction and punishment) from where they do not know","7:183":"And I give them time. Indeed My plan is sound","7:184":"Or did they not think that their friend is not mad? He is only a clear warner","7:185":"Or did they not look at the kingdom of the skies and the earth and everything God created, and that perhaps their term is getting close? So in what saying do they believe after that (Quran)","7:186":"Whoever God misguides, then there is no guide for him, and He leaves them wandering in their rebellion","7:187":"They ask you about the hour: when is its anchor (arrival)? Say: its knowledge is only with my Master, He shall only displays it at its time, it is heavy on the skies and on the earth, it only comes to you suddenly. They ask you as if you are well informed about it. Say: its knowledge is only with God, but most people do not know","7:188":"Say: I do not have power of any benefit or any harm for myself, except what God wants, and if I knew the unseen, I would want a lot of the good things, and nothing bad would touch me, I am only a warner and a giver of good news for people who believe","7:189":"He is the One who created you from a single being, and He made its spouse from it to find tranquility in it. So when he covered her (and had intercourse with her), she carried a light load and went on with it, then when it became heavy, they called on God their Master: if You give us a good child, we shall be of the thankful ones","7:190":"But when God gave them a good child, they set up partners for Him in what He gave them. God is above what they associate (with Him)","7:191":"Do they associate something (with Him) that does not create anything and they are created","7:192":"And they cannot be of any help for them and they cannot help themselves","7:193":"And if you invite them (the polytheists) to the guidance, they will not follow you. It is the same for you whether you invite them or you are silent","7:194":"Those whom you call on besides God are servants like you, so call on them and they should answer you if you are truthful","7:195":"Do they have feet to walk with them, or do they have hands to grab with them, or do they have eyes to see with them, or do they have ears to hear with them? Say: call on your associates (for God), then plot against me and do not wait","7:196":"My protector is God, the One who sent down the book, and He protects the righteous","7:197":"And those whom you call besides Him cannot help you and they cannot help themselves","7:198":"And if you invite them (the polytheists) to the guidance, they do not hear, and you see them looking at you while they do not see","7:199":"Take to the pardon (and excuse them) and order what is right, and stay away from the ignorant ones","7:200":"And if a temptation from Satan tempts you, then look for God’s protection, indeed He hears all and knows all","7:201":"Indeed those who control themselves, when a transient (thought) from Satan touches them, they remember (God) then they become insightful","7:202":"And their bothers (and friends) help them in the error, and they will not stop short","7:203":"And when you did not bring them a sign, they said: why did you not choose it? Say: I only follow what is revealed to me from my Master, this (Quran) is enlightenment from your Master and a guide and a mercy for people who believe","7:204":"And when the Quran is read, then listen to it and keep quiet, so that you may receive mercy","7:205":"And remember your Master in yourself (in your mind), humbly and in fear and without being loud in words, in the morning and the evening, and do not be of the negligent ones","7:206":"Indeed those who are with your Master are not arrogant in His servitude, and they glorify Him, and they show humbleness for Him","8:1":"They ask you about extras (left in war), say: extras are for God and the messenger. So be cautious of God and set the matters straight between you, and obey God and His messenger if you are believers","8:2":"Believers are only those who when God is mentioned, their hearts trembles, and when His signs are read to them, it increases their belief and they put their trust in their Master","8:3":"those who perform the mandatory prayer and spend out of what We provided for them","8:4":"They are the true believers. They have ranks with their Master and forgiveness and a noble provision","8:5":"As your Master rightly made you go out of your home, while indeed a group of the believers disliked it","8:6":"They argue with you about the truth after it was made clear, as if they are driven to the death while they are watching","8:7":"And (remember) when God promised you that one of the two groups will be yours, and you liked the unarmed (group) to be yours, while God wanted to prove the truth with His words and to cut off the root of the disbelievers","8:8":"So that He proves the truth and eliminates the falsehood, even if the guilty ones dislike it","8:9":"(Remember) when you asked for your Master’s help and He answered you: I am your helper with one thousand angels, in rows","8:10":"God only made it as good news and to reassure your hearts with it.

God has the enormous grace","8:30":"And (remember) when those who disbelieved plotted against you to imprison you or to kill you or to drive you out, and they plotted and God planned and God is the best planner","8:31":"And when Our signs are read to them, they say: we have certainly heard, if we want we would say similar to this, this is nothing but stories of the earlier ones","8:32":"And when they said: God, if this is the truth from You, then shower us with stones from the sky and bring us a painful punishment","8:33":"And God is not to punish them while you are among them, and God is not their punisher while they ask for forgiveness","8:34":"And what is for them that God should not punish them while they hold (people) back from the Sacred Mosque and they are not its guardians? Its guardians are only those who control themselves, but most of them do not know","8:35":"And their mandatory prayer in the house (Ka’aba) was nothing but whistling and clapping, so taste the punishment for what you used to disbelieve","8:36":"Indeed those who disbelieved spend their wealth to obstruct God's way. So they are going to spend it, then it becomes regret for them, then they are defeated, and those who disbelieved are gathered in hell","8:37":"So that God separates the bad from the good, and then He places the bad upon each other, piling them up together, and then puts it into hell. They are the losers","8:38":"Tell those who disbelieved that if they stop, what has passed is forgiven for them, and if they return (to it), then way of (dealing with) the earlier ones has preceded","8:39":"And fight them until there is no more turmoil (and persecution) and all of the religion is only for God.

God does not guide the disobedient people","9:25":"God has certainly helped you in many places. And at the time of Hunain, when your great number impressed you but it was of no use to you at all, and the land with its vastness tightened around you, then you turned back escaping","9:26":"Then God sent down tranquility to His messenger and to the believers, and He sent down troops that you could not see them, and He punished those who disbelieved. That is payback of the disbelievers","9:27":"Then after that, God accepts the repentance of anyone He wants, and God is forgiving and merciful","9:28":"You who believe, indeed the polytheists are unclean, so they should not come near the Sacred Mosque after this year of theirs, and if you are afraid of poverty (because of this), then God will enrich you from His grace if He wants. God is knowledgeable and wise","9:29":"Fight those among the people of the book who do not believe in God and the last day and they do not forbid what God and His messenger have forbidden and they do not adopt the right way of life, until they pay the tax from their hand and they are compliant","9:30":"The Jewish said: Ezra is son of God. And the Christians said: Christ is son of God. This is their word from their mouth and it is like saying of those who disbelieved before them. May God fight them, they have deviated","9:31":"They took their religious scholars and their monks and the Christ, son of Mary, as their masters besides God while they were ordered to only serve the One god. There is no god except Him. He is flawless from what they associate","9:32":"They want to extinguish God’s light with (words of) their mouths, while God refuses anything other than completing His light (and revelation), even though the disbelievers dislike it","9:33":"He is the One who sent His messenger with the guidance and the true way of life in order to inform him about all of the religion (God's recommended way of life), even though the polytheists dislike it","9:34":"You who believe, indeed many of the religious scholars and the monks eat up people’s wealth falsely and obstruct God’s way. And give the news of a painful punishment to those who store gold and silver and do not spend it in God's way","9:35":"On a day that they (their gold and silver) are heated in the fire of hell, and their foreheads and their sides and their back is branded with it, (they are told) this is what you stored for yourselves, so taste what you used to store","9:36":"Indeed the number of month before God is twelve months in God's book since the day He created the skies and the earth. Four of them are sacred (fighting is forbidden in them). This is the lasting way of life. Do not wrong yourselves in them. And fight the polytheists together as they fight you together. And know that God is with those who control themselves","9:37":"Postponement (of the sacred months) is only an increase in the disbelief, which those who disbelieved are misguided by it. They make it lawful one year and forbid it another year, to make up the number that God made sacred, therefore they make lawful what God made unlawful. Their bad deeds are beautified for them, and God does not guide the disbelieving people","9:38":"You who believe, what is with you that when you are told to march forward in God's way, you hold on to the earth (and do not move)? Are you satisfied with this world’s life instead of the hereafter? The enjoyment of this world’s life against the hereafter is a little","9:39":"If you do not march forward, He punishes you with a painful punishment, and He replaces you with other people, and you do not harm Him at all. And God is capable of everything","9:40":"If you do not help him, God has helped him when those who disbelieved drove him out (of Mecca), he was one of two when they were in the cave, and he said to his friend: do not be sad, God is indeed with us. So God sent down His tranquility to him and strengthened him with troops that you do not see them, and He made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest and God’s word the highest. God is the powerful and the wise","9:41":"March forward, lightly or heavily (equipped) and try hard with your possessions and your lives in God’s way. This is better for you if you knew","9:42":"Had there been an immediate gain and an easy journey they would have certainly followed you, but the far distance was hard for them, and they are going to swear by God: we would certainly come out with you if we could. They destroy themselves, and God knows they are definitely liars","9:43":"God excused you (Muhammad), why did you permit them (to stay behind) before it becomes to you those who were truthful and you know the liars","9:44":"Those who believe in God and the last day do not ask your permission to try hard with their possessions and their lives. God knows those who control themselves","9:45":"Only those who do not believe in God and the last day and their hearts are in doubt ask your permission (to be excused from fighting). So they waver (back and forth) in their doubt","9:46":"If they wanted to go out (with you), they would have prepared for it, but God disliked sending them, so He held them back, and it was said: sit with the sitting ones","9:47":"If they had come out among you, they would have added nothing to you but trouble, and they would have actively participated among you looking for turmoil (and disorder), and some among you would have listened for them (and spied for them). God knows the wrongdoers","9:48":"They have certainly looked for turmoil (and disorder) in the past, and they turned the issues upside down for you, until the truth came and God’s command became clear, and they disliked it","9:49":"And some among them say: permit me (to stay behind), and do not test me. (know that) They fell in the test already. And indeed hell surrounds the disbelievers","9:50":"If any good happens to you, it upsets them. And if you suffer a tragedy, they say: we took (care of) our affairs earlier (by not going to war), and they turn away while they are happy","9:51":"Say: nothing would ever happen to us except what God wrote down for us (according to His laws), and He is our protector. And the believers should trust in God","9:52":"Say: are you waiting for one of the two goods for us (victory or getting killed in God's way), while we wait for you that God strikes you with a punishment from Him or with our hands, so wait and we wait with you","9:53":"Say (to the hypocrites): spend willingly or unwillingly, it will never be accepted from you, because indeed you are disobedient people","9:54":"And nothing prevented their spending from being accepted, except that they disbelieved in God and His messenger, and they only come to the mandatory prayer lazily, and they only spend unwillingly","9:55":"So do not be impressed with their wealth and their children, God only wants to punish them with it in this world’s life, and they die while they are disbelievers","9:56":"And they swear by God that indeed they are of you while they are not of you, but they are scared people","9:57":"If they find a shelter or a cave or a place to enter (for hiding) they would definitely turn to it while they rush","9:58":"And some of them criticize you regarding (distribution of) the charities, if they are given from it they are happy, and if they are not given from it then they get angry","9:59":"(And it would be better) If they were happy with what God and His messenger gave them, and had said: God is sufficient for us, God is going to give us from His grace and (so is) His messenger, and we are fond of God","9:60":"The (mandatory) charities are only for the poor and the needy and the processors of it and those whose hearts are interested (in submission) and (for freeing) the slaves and those in debt and in God's way and the traveler (in need), a mandate from God. God is knowledgeable and wise","9:61":"And some of them are those who harass the prophet and they say: he is all ears. Say: it is better for you that he is all ears, as he believes in God and believes in the believers and he is a mercy for those of you who believed. And those who harass the messenger of God have a painful punishment","9:62":"They swear by God for you to please you, while God and His messenger are more deserving to be pleased, if they were believers","9:63":"Did they not know that whoever opposes God and His messenger then indeed fire of hell is for him, remaining in there forever? That is the great humiliation","9:64":"The hypocrites are afraid that a chapter is sent down about them informing them of what is in their hearts. Say: make fun, indeed God brings out what you are wary of","9:65":"And if you ask them, they shall say: we were only kidding and playing. Say: were you making fun of God and His signs and His messenger","9:66":"Do not apologize, indeed you disbelieved after your belief. If We excuse a group of you, We will punish a group, because they were guilty","9:67":"The hypocrite men and the hypocrite women are like each other, they instruct what is wrong (unacceptable) and prohibit from what is right (acceptable), and they withhold their hands. They forgot God, so He forgets them. The hypocrites are indeed the disobedient ones","9:68":"God promised fire of hell to the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women and the disbelievers, remaining in there forever. It is enough for them. And God cursed them and an everlasting punishment is for them","9:69":"Like those before you who were more powerful than you and had more wealth and children, so they enjoyed their share and you enjoyed your share as those before you enjoyed their share, and you engaged (in idle talks and thoughts) as they engaged. Their works is useless in this world and the hereafter, and they are the losers","9:70":"Did not the story of those before them come to them, people of Noah and Aad and Thamud, and people of Abraham and inhabitants of Midian (people of Shu'aib) and the turned over cities? Their messengers brought them the clear proofs, so God was not to wrong them, but they were wrong to themselves","9:71":"And the believing men and the believing women are friends of each other, they instruct to the right (acceptable) and prohibit from the wrong (unacceptable) and they perform the mandatory prayer and give to the mandatory charity and obey God and His messenger. They are those whom God is going to be merciful to them. God is powerful and wise","9:72":"God promised the believing men and the believing women gardens which rivers flow through them, remaining in there forever, and beautiful houses in eternal gardens. And pleasure of God is greater. This is the great victory","9:73":"Prophet, try hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be firm against them. Their housing is hell, and it is a bad destination","9:74":"They swear by God that they did not say, while they have certainly said the word of the disbelief, and they disbelieved after their submission, and they tried for what they did not get. They were only resentful because God and His messenger enriched them from His grace. So if they repent, it would better for them, and if they turn away, God punishes them with a painful punishment in this world and the hereafter, and there is no protector or helper for them on the earth","9:75":"Some of them promised God that if He gives us from His grace, we shall give to charity and we shall be of the righteous","9:76":"So when God gave them from His grace, they became stingy with it and they turned away and they opposed","9:77":"So He made hypocrisy emerge in their hearts until the day they meet Him, because they broke what they promised God and because they were lying","9:78":"Did they not know that God knows their secret and their whisper and that God knows the unseen","9:79":"Those who criticize the volunteers among the believers in (giving to) charities, and they ridicule those who find nothing (to give) except their effort, God ridicules them and a painful punishment is for them","9:80":"Whether you (Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them or you do not ask forgiveness for them, even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, God will never forgive them. That is because they disbelieved in God and His messenger, and God does not guide the disobedient people","9:81":"Those who stayed behind were happy with their sitting, contradicting God's messenger and they disliked trying hard with their possessions and their lives in God's way and said: we will not march out in the heat. Say: fire of hell is much hotter, if they would understand","9:82":"They should laugh a little and should cry a lot for payback of what they were doing","9:83":"So if God returns you to a group of them, then they ask your permission for coming out (with you to fight), then say: you will never ever come out with me and you will never fight any enemy with me, indeed you were happy with sitting (at your homes) the first time, so sit with those who stayed behind","9:84":"And do not ever pray for anyone of them who dies, and do not stand at his grave. They disbelieved in God and His messenger and died while they were disobedient","9:85":"And do not be impressed by their wealth and their children, as God only wants to punish them with it in this world, and they die while they are disbelievers","9:86":"And when a chapter was sent down (saying) that believe in God and try hard with His messenger, wealthy men among them ask your permission, and they say: leave us be with the sitting ones","9:87":"They were happy being with those who remained behind, and their hearts was sealed so they do not understand","9:88":"But the messenger and those who believed with him tried hard with their possessions and their lives. And the good things are for them and they are the successful ones","9:89":"God prepared gardens which rivers flow through them for them, remaining in there forever. That is the great victory","9:90":"And those making excuses among the desert Arabs came in order to be given permission to them (to stay behind), and those who lied to God and His messenger sat (in their homes). Those who disbelieved among them are going to suffer a painful punishment","9:91":"There is no blame on the weak, or on the sick, or on those who do not find anything to spend when they act in good faith toward God and His messenger. And there is not any way against the good doers, and God is forgiving and merciful","9:92":"And not (any blame) on those who when they came to you to provide them with mounts (animals for riding), you said I cannot find anything to mount you on it, and they turned back with their eyes full of tears, sorrowful that they do not find anything to spend","9:93":"The way is only against those who ask your permission and they are rich. They were happy to be with those who remained behind, and God sealed their hearts so they do not know","9:94":"They apologize to you when you return to them. Say: do not apologize, we would never believe you, God has informed us about you. And God and His messenger are going to see your actions, then you are returned to knower of the unseen and the visible, then He informs you of what you were doing","9:95":"When you return to them, they are going to swear by God for you, so that you stay away from them. So stay away from them, indeed they are filthy, and their housing is hell as payback for what they were doing","9:96":"They swear for you so that you are pleased with them, but even if you are pleased with them, God is not pleased with the disobedient people","9:97":"The desert Arabs are the worst in disbelief and hypocrisy, and more likely that they do not know the limits which God sent down to His messenger. God is knowledgeable and wise","9:98":"Some of the desert Arabs consider what they spend as a fine, and wait for a disaster for you. The bad disaster is for them. And God hears all and knows all","9:99":"And some of the desert Arabs believe in God and the last day, and consider what they spend as (a means of) closeness to God and the messenger’s praying (for them). Know that it is (a means of) closeness for them. God is going to admit them into His mercy. God is forgiving and merciful","9:100":"And God is pleased with the first pioneers among the migrants and the helpers, and those who followed them with goodness, and they are pleased with Him, and God prepared gardens which rivers flow through them for them, remaining in there forever and ever. That is the great victory","9:101":"Some of those around you from the desert Arabs are hypocrites, and some of the people of the city (of Medina) insist on hypocrisy, and you do not know them, but We know them. We are going to punish them twice then they are returned to a great punishment","9:102":"And others who confessed to their sins and they mixed good deed and bad, perhaps God accepts their repentance. God is indeed forgiving and merciful","9:103":"Take charity from their wealth to cleanse them and to purify them with it, and pray for them as your prayer is indeed comforting to them. God hears all and knows all","9:104":"Did they not know that it is God who accepts the repentance from His servants, and takes the charities, and that God is the acceptor of repentance, the merciful","9:105":"Say: do (what you want), as God and His messenger and the believers are going to see your action, and you are going to be returned to knower of the unseen and the visible, then He informs you of what you were doing","9:106":"And others who expect God’s order. He either punishes them or accepts their repentance. God is knowledgeable and wise","9:107":"And (there are) those who built a mosque for harm and disbelief and for division among the believers, and as an outpost for those who previously fought God and His messenger, and they swear that we only wish the best, but God testifies that they are liars","9:108":"Never stand in there, as a mosque that is built based on the righteousness from the first day deserves more that you stand in there, as there are men in it who like to be cleansed, and God loves those who purify themselves","9:109":"Is one who based his foundation on being cautious of God and His pleasure better or one who based his foundation on the edge of a cliff that is about to crumble and is falling down into fire of hell with him? God does not guide the wrongdoing people","9:110":"Their foundation that they built is always a source of doubt in their hearts, until their hearts are torn into pieces. God is knowledgeable and wise","9:111":"Indeed God purchased from the believers their lives and their possessions for the garden that is for them. They fight in God's way, and they kill and are killed. This is a true promise upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Quran. And who fulfills his promise better than God? So, be glad with your trade that you bargained with it, that is the great victory","9:112":"(Believers are those) who repent, who serve, who praise (God), who travel (or fast), who bow down, who show humbleness, who instruct to the right (acceptable) and prohibit from the wrong (unacceptable), and who observe the limits set by God, and give good news to the believers","9:113":"It is not for the prophet and those who believed to ask for forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they are their relatives (or close ones), after it is clear to them that they are inhabitants of the hellfire","9:114":"And Abraham asking forgiveness for his father was only because of a promise that he had promised it to him. But when it was clear to him that he was God's enemy, he stayed away from him. Indeed Abraham was caring and patient","9:115":"And God is not to misguide any group after He guided them, until He clarifies for them what they should be cautious of.

That is because they do not suffer any thirst or difficulty or hunger in God's way, or any step they take to anger the disbelievers or any gain they gain against an enemy unless it is written down for them as good work. God does not waste reward of the good doers","9:121":"And anything small or large that they spent (in God's way), and any valley they crossed is written down for them, so that God rewards them better than what they were doing","9:122":"It is not (appropriate) for the believers to go out all together. Why did not a party from each group go out to thoroughly understand about the religion, and to warn their group when they return to them so that they may be wary","9:123":"You who believe, fight those of the disbelievers who are near you and they should find firmness in you. And know that God is with those who control themselves","9:124":"And whenever a chapter is sent down, then some among them say: this (chapter) increased belief of which one of you? As for those who believed, it increased their belief and they are glad","9:125":"And as for those who have a disease in their hearts, it added filth to their filthiness, and they died while they were disbelievers","9:126":"Or do they not see that they are tested once or twice every year? Yet they do not repent and they do not take notice","9:127":"And whenever a chapter is sent down, they look at each other (saying): does anyone see you? Then they turn away. God turned away their hearts because indeed they are a group who do not understand","9:128":"Certainly a messenger has come to you from among yourselves, what bothers you is difficult for him, (he is) anxious about you and is gentle and merciful to the believers","9:129":"If they turn away, then say: God is enough for me, there is no god except Him, I trust in Him and He is the Master of the great throne","10:1":"L.R. (Alif. Lam. Ra.). These are the verses of the wise book","10:2":"Is it a surprise to the people that We revealed to a man among them to warn the people, and to give good news to those who believed that they have a true footing with their Master? The disbelievers said: this is certainly an obvious magician","10:3":"Indeed your Master is God the One who created the skies and the earth in six days (stages), then He settled on the throne directing the affair. There is no mediator except after His permission. That is God your Master, so serve Him. Do you not take notice","10:4":"Return of all of you is to Him. God’s promise is true. He begins the creation then brings it back to justly reward those who believed and did good works, and those who disbelieved have a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment for what they used to disbelieve","10:5":"He is the One who made the sun shine and the moon a (reflection of) light and determined its positions so you know the number of years and the count (of days and time). God rightfully created that. He explains the signs for people who know","10:6":"Indeed in the alternation (and the difference) of the night and the day and what God created in the skies and the earth there are signs for people who control themselves","10:7":"Indeed those who do not expect to meet Us and are happy with this world’s life and are satisfied with it, and those who are negligent of Our signs","10:8":"their housing is the fire, for what they were doing","10:9":"Indeed those who believed and did good works, their Master guides them to gardens of delight which rivers flow through them, because of their belief","10:10":"Their prayer in it is: God, glory to You. And their greeting in it is: peace (and well-being). And the end of their prayer is that all praise belongs to God, Master of humankind","10:11":"If God rushes to the badness (and punishment) for the people as much as they want to rush to the good, their term would be complete (and they would be punished). So We leave those who do not expect to meet Us, blindly wandering in their rebellion","10:12":"And when the harm happens to the human being, he calls on Us (lying) on his side or sitting or standing, but when We remove his harm from him, he moves on as if he did not call on Us for harm that happened to him. That is how what they were doing was beautified for the excessive ones","10:13":"And We have certainly destroyed the generations before you when they did wrong, while their messenger brought them the clear proofs and they would not believe. That is how We payback the guilty people","10:14":"Then We made you successors on the earth after them to see how you do","10:15":"When Our clear signs are read to them, those who do not expect to meet Us, say: bring a Quran other than this or change it. Say: it is not for me to change it on my own accord, I only follow what is revealed to me, indeed I am afraid of the punishment of a great day if I disobey my Master","10:16":"Say: if God wanted, I would not have read it to you, and He would not have made you know it, and I have stayed among you a lifetime before that, do you not understand","10:17":"Who is more wrong than someone who makes up a lie (and attributes it) to God or denies His signs? Indeed the guilty ones do not succeed","10:18":"And they serve, other than God, that which does not harm them and does not benefit them, and they say: these are our mediators before God.

He is flawless and is above what they associate (with Him)","10:19":"People were only a single community then they disagreed, and if it was not for a word that previously issued from your Master, it would have been judged between them about what they disagreed about it","10:20":"And they say: why a miracle was not send down to him from his Master? Say: the unseen is only for God (to know), so wait and I am with you among those who wait","10:21":"And when We make people taste a mercy after a harm happened to them, they immediately have a plot against Our signs. Say: God is faster in planning. Indeed Our messengers (angels) write down what you plot","10:22":"He is the One who makes you go in the land and the sea until when you were on board the ships and they sailed with them with a nice wind and they were happy with it, then a strong wind came to it and the waves came to them from every side and they thought they were surrounded by it, they called on God being sincere to Him in the religion (saying): if You save us from this, we shall be of the thankful ones","10:23":"But when He saved them, they immediately wronged on the earth unjustifiably. People, your wrong (actions) for enjoyment of this world's life is only against yourselves, then your return is to Us and We inform you of what you were doing","10:24":"The example of this world's life is indeed like a rain that We sent it down from the sky, then the plants of the earth from which the people and the livestock eat, mixes with it, until when the earth takes its decoration and is beautified, and its inhabitants think that they have power over it, then Our command comes to it by night or day and We make it as a mowed down field as if it did not exist the day before.

They are inhabitants of the garden remaining in there forever","10:27":"And those who did the bad, payback of bad is equal to it, and humiliation covers them. They have no defender against God, as if their faces are covered with pieces of the night's darkness. They are inhabitants of the fire remaining in there forever","10:28":"On a day that We gather them all, then We say to those who associated (partners with God): at your place, you and your partners. Then We separate them from one another. And their partners say: it was not us that you were serving","10:29":"and God is enough as witness between us and between you, that we were unaware of your servitude","10:30":"There, every person examines what it did before, and they are returned to God, their rightful protector/master, and what they used to make up abandons them","10:31":"Say: who provides you from the sky and the earth, or who owns the hearing and the eyesight, and who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living, and who regulates the affairs? They are going to say: God. Then say: will you not be cautious (of Him)","10:32":"This is God, your true Master. What is there after the truth except the error (and lie)? Then, how are you turned away (from the truth)","10:33":"That is how your Master's word proved true against those who disobeyed, for indeed they do not believe","10:34":"Say: does any of your partners (of God) initiate the creation then brings it back? Say: God initiates the creation and then brings it back, so how do you deviate","10:35":"Say: does any of your partners (of God) guides to the truth? Say: God guides to the truth, is one who guides to the truth more deserving to be followed or one who does not guide (or does not find the way) unless he is guided, then what is the matter with you? What is your opinion","10:36":"And most of them only follow guess. Indeed the guess has no use against the truth at all. God knows what they do","10:37":"And this Quran is not made up by anyone other than God, and it is a confirmation of what is before it, and an explanation of the book, no doubt about it (that it is) from the Master of Human kind","10:38":"Or do they say: he (Muhammad) made it up? Say: if you are truthful, then bring a chapter like it, and call on anyone you can (for help) other than God","10:39":"No, but they denied that which they did not have knowledge of it, and its interpretation (of its events) have not come to them.

Can you make the deaf listen even though they do not understand","10:43":"And some of them look at you. Can you guide the blind (by showing the way) even though they do not see","10:44":"Indeed God does not wrong the people at all, but people wrong themselves","10:45":"And a day He gathers them, (will be) as if they only stayed for only an hour of the day. They recognize each other. Those who denied meeting of God have lost and they were not guided","10:46":"And whether We show you some of what We promised them or We make you die (before that), their return is to Us, then God is witness over what they do","10:47":"And for every community is a messenger. So when their messenger comes, it would be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged","10:48":"And they say: when is this promise, if you are truthful","10:49":"Say: I have no power of harm or benefit for myself except what God wants. For every community there is a period (to believe), When their time comes, they cannot delay for an hour or put it forward","10:50":"Say: what do you think, if His punishment comes to you by night or day, what part of it do the guilty ones want to be rushed","10:51":"Would you believe in it when it occurs? Why (believe) now, while you wanted it to be rushed","10:52":"Then it is said to those who did wrong: taste the eternal punishment, are you being punished for (anything) other than what you used to do","10:53":"And they want you to tell if it (the punishment) is true. Say: yes, by my Master, it is indeed true and you cannot disable/escape it","10:54":"And if each person that did wrong, had all that is on the earth, he would have ransomed with it, and he would hide the regret when he sees the punishment.

God dominates over His affair, but most people do not know","12:22":"And when he reached his maturity, We gave him wisdom and knowledge, and that is how We reward the good doers","12:23":"And she, in whose house he was, wanted to seduce him (to lie with him), and she locked the doors and said: come here. He said: may God protect me, indeed He is my Master and He made my place good, indeed the wrongdoers do not succeed","12:24":"And she has certainly desired him, and he would have desired her if he had not seen his Master's proof. That is how We turn the badness and the indecency away from him. He was indeed one of Our devoted servants","12:25":"And they both raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from behind, and they found her husband at the door. She said: what is the punishment of anyone who wanted to abuse your wife except that he is imprisoned or a painful punishment","12:26":"He said: she wanted to seduce me (to lie with her). And a witness from her family testified: if his shirt is torn from the front, then she is telling the truth and he is a liar","12:27":"and if his shirt is torn from behind, then she is lying and he is truthful","12:28":"So when he saw that his shirt is torn from behind, he said (to her): indeed that is from your plot, indeed your plot is great","12:29":"Joseph, stay away from this.

He hears all and knows all","12:35":"So it seemed proper to them that they should imprison him for a while even after they saw the signs (of his innocence)","12:36":"And two young men entered the prison with him. One of them said: I see myself pressing wine (in my dreams). The other one said: I see myself carrying bread over my head and the birds eating from it. Tell us its interpretation as we see you are of the good doers","12:37":"He said: food that you are provided with it does not come to you, unless I tell you of its interpretation before it comes to you. This is some of what my Master taught me. I left faith of people who do not believe in God and they disbelieve in the hereafter","12:38":"And I followed faith of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, it is not for us to associate anything (as partner) with God. This is from God’s grace to us and to the people, but most of the people do not thank","12:39":"My two prison mates, are several different masters better or the one dominant God","12:40":"Other than Him, you only serve names which you and your fathers named (and made up) which God did not send down any reason for it.

They said: our father, what else we wish for, this is our merchandise that was returned to us, and we get supplies for our family, and we take care of our brother, and we get an additional measure of a camel’s load, this is a small (and easy) measure","12:66":"He (Jacob) said: I will never send him with you until you give me a commitment by God that you shall bring him (back) to me unless it is completely out of your control. So when they gave him their commitment, he said: God is trustee over what we say","12:67":"And he said: my sons, do not enter from one gate, but enter from different gates, I cannot be of any use to you at all against God, as the rule only belongs to God, I put my trust in Him, and those who trust should put their trust in Him","12:68":"And when they entered from where their father instructed them, it was of no use to them at all against God, but it was a requirement of Jacob himself which was carried out. And indeed he had knowledge because of what We taught him, but most people do not know","12:69":"And when they entered upon Joseph, he placed his brother next to himself and said: I am indeed your brother, so do not be sad by what they were doing","12:70":"And when he supplied them with their supplies, he placed the drinking cup in his brother's saddlebag, then a caller announced: you in the caravan, you are thieves","12:71":"They said while turning around to them: what do you miss","12:72":"They said: we miss king’s cup, and for anyone who brings it is a camel load (of supplies), and I am its guarantor","12:73":"They said: by God, you have certainly known that we did not come to commit corruption in the land, and we are not thieves","12:74":"They said: then what is its punishment, if you are liars","12:75":"They said: its punishment, for whomever that it is found in his saddlebag, is himself (becoming a slave) as punishment, that is how we punish the wrongdoers","12:76":"So he began with their sacks before his brother’s sack, then he brought it out of his brother’s sack. That is how We plotted for Joseph. He was not to take his brother according to the king’s law unless God wants. We raise ranks of anyone We want. And above all having knowledge is a (more) knowledgeable one","12:77":"They said: if he steals, a brother of his has also stolen in the past.

The oldest of them said: did you not know that your father has taken a commitment from you by God, and you failed about Joseph in the past? So I would never leave this land until my father permits me or God rules for me, and He is the best of the rulers (and judges)","12:81":"Return to your father and say: our father, indeed your son stole, and we only testified to what we knew, and we could not guard against the unseen","12:82":"And ask (the people of) the town that we were in it, and the caravan that we returned in it, and we are certainly truthful","12:83":"He (Jacob) said: no, but you let yourselves be seduced by a matter, so a nice patience (is necessary for me), perhaps God brings them all to me, indeed He is the knowledgeable and the wise","12:84":"And he turned away from them and said: I am sorry about Joseph. And his eyes turned white (and blinded) from the sorrow, and he is a suppressor (of his sorrow and anger)","12:85":"They said: by God, you will not stop remembering Joseph until you become sick or you are dead","12:86":"He said: I only complain to God about my pain and sorrow, and I know from God what you do not know","12:87":"My sons, go and look for Joseph and his brother, and do not lose hope of God’s kindness, indeed only the disbelieving people lose hope of God's kindness","12:88":"So when they entered upon him (Joseph), they said: powerful one, hard times happened to us and our family, and we brought little merchandise, but give us the full measure and be charitable to us, as God indeed rewards the charitable ones","12:89":"He said: do you know what you did with Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant","12:90":"They said: are you indeed Joseph? He said: I am Joseph and this is my brother, God has been gracious to us, indeed anyone who controls himself and perseveres then God does not waste reward of the good doers","12:91":"They said: by God, certainly God has preferred you over us and we were sinners","12:92":"He said: (there is) no blame on you today, God forgives you, and He is most merciful of the merciful ones","12:93":"Go with this shirt of mine, and throw it over my father’s face, he regains sight, and bring me all your family","12:94":"And when the caravan left, their father said: I certainly find smell of Joseph, if you don't think that I am senile","12:95":"They said: by God, indeed you are in your old mistake","12:96":"So when the giver of good news came, he threw it over his face and his sight returned. He said: did I not say to you indeed I know from God what you do not know","12:97":"They said: our father, ask forgiveness for us for our sins, as we were indeed sinners","12:98":"He said: I will ask forgiveness for you from my Master, He is indeed the forgiving, the merciful","12:99":"When they entered upon Joseph, he placed his parents next to him and said: God willing, enter Egypt safely","12:100":"And he raised his parent to the throne and they fell down before him humbly, and he said: my father, this is the interpretation of my dream in the past, my Master has made it true, and He has been good to me when He took me out of the prison and brought you from the desert after Satan set off enmity between me and my brothers, my Master is indeed nice to what He wants, indeed He is the knowledgeable and the wise","12:101":"My Master, you have given me some of the rule and taught me some of the interpretation of events (dreams). Creator of the skies and the earth, You are my protector in this life and the hereafter, make me die as a submitter and join me with the righteous","12:102":"This is from the stories of the unseen that We reveal to you, and you were not with them when they all agreed on their issue while they plot","12:103":"And most people do not believe, even though you are eager","12:104":"And you do not ask them for any wage for it. It (Quran) is only a reminder for humankind","12:105":"And how many a sign in the skies and the earth they pass by it and they turn away from it","12:106":"And most of them do not believe in God except while they are still associating (partners with Him)","12:107":"Do they feel safe about an overwhelming God’s punishment coming to them, or the hour comes to them suddenly while they do not realize","12:108":"Say: this is my way, I and anyone who follows me invite (people) to God with insight, and glory to God (He is flawless), and I am not of the polytheists","12:109":"And We did not send (messengers) before you, except men from among the people of the towns whom We revealed to them. Did they not travel throughout the earth to see what the end of those before them was? And the home of the hereafter is certainly better for those who control themselves, do you not understand","12:110":"Until when the messengers lost hope and thought that they have been lied to, Our help came to them and anyone We want was saved. And Our punishment is not held back from the guilty people","12:111":"Certainly, there is a lesson in their stories for the people of understanding (reasonable people). It is not a saying that is made up, but a confirmation of that which is before it (in the Torah and the Gospel), and an explanation of everything (concerning religion) and a guide and a mercy for people who believe","13:1":"L.M.R. (Alif. Lam. Mim. Ra.) These are verses of the book. And that which was sent down to you from your Master is the truth, but most people do not believe","13:2":"God is the One who raised the skies without any pillars that you see it, then He settled on the throne, and He controlled the sun and the moon, each running (its course) in a finite period. He directs the affairs, He explains the verses (signs) so that you may be certain of meeting your Master","13:3":"And He is the One who stretched the earth and put mountains and rivers in it, and He made all kind of fruit in pairs of two (male and female) in it, He covers the night over the day. Indeed there are signs in that for people who think","13:4":"And in the earth there are adjacent pieces and gardens of grapes and plantation and date palms from same root and not from the same root watered with same water, and We make some of them preferable to eat than the others. Indeed there are signs in that for people who understand","13:5":"And if you are surprised, then their saying is astonishing: will we be created again when we turn to dust? They are those who disbelieved in their Master, and they have shackles around their necks, and they are inhabitants of the fire, they remain in it forever","13:6":"They ask you to rush with the bad before the good while similar examples (of punishment) have passed before them. And your Master certainly has forgiveness for the people about their wrongdoing. And indeed your Master is severe in punishment","13:7":"And those who disbelieved say: why a miracle (sign) was not sent down to him from his Master. You are only a warner. And for every group there is a guide","13:8":"God knows what every female carries (during pregnancy), and how much the wombs fall short or exceed (in length or in number), and everything with Him is in proper measures","13:9":"Knower of the unseen and the visible, the greatest and the highest","13:10":"It is the same whether any of you hides the word or anyone says it loud, or whether anyone hides in the night or goes about in the day","13:11":"For each (person) there are followers in front of him and behind him which guard him by God’s command. Indeed God does not change condition of any group until they change what is in themselves. And when God wants something bad for a group, there is no turning it away and they have no protector besides Him","13:12":"He is the One who shows you the lightning, a fear and a hope, and He produces the heavy clouds","13:13":"And the thunder glorifies Him with His praise, and so do angels from His fear. And He sends the lightning, and He strikes anyone He wants with it, and yet they argue about God, and He is severe in punishment","13:14":"The true calling belongs to Him, and those whom they call on other than Him do not answer them at all, except like someone who stretches his hands toward the water to reach his mouth, but it does not reach it. And the call of the disbelievers is only in error (and it is useless)","13:15":"Everyone in the skies and in the earth, willingly or unwillingly, shows humbleness to God, and so do their shadows in the mornings and the afternoons","13:16":"Say: who is the Master of the skies and the earth? Say: God. Say: did you take protectors other than God who have no power to benefit or to harm themselves? Say: are the blind and the one who can see equal, or are the darkness and the light equal? Or did they make partners for God that created as He created, and it seemed like the creation to them? Say: God is creator of everything, and He is the One, the supreme (and dominant)","13:17":"He sent down rain from the sky and it flowed in the valleys according to their measure, then the current carried the foam that built up (on its surface). And similar foam (builds up) from what they melt in the fire to make ornaments or utensils. That is how God gives example of the truth and the falsehood. As for the foam, it goes away uselessly, but that which benefits the people stays on the earth. This is how God gives the examples","13:18":"For those who answered their Master is the good (reward), while those who did not answer Him, if they had all that is in the earth and the like of it with that, they would have offered it as compensation. They have the bad account, and their housing is hell, and it is a bad resting place","13:19":"Is someone who knows, that what was sent down to you from your Master is the truth, same as one who is blind? Only the people of understanding (reasonable people) take notice","13:20":"Those who fulfill God’s promise and do not break the commitment","13:21":"and those who join what God ordered it to be joined, and they fear their Master, and they are afraid of the bad account","13:22":"and those who persevered looking for their Master’s attention (and His pleasure) and performed the mandatory prayer and they spent from what We provided them secretly and openly and they drive back the badness with the goodness, for them is the final home","13:23":"Eternal gardens, which they enter it and anyone who was righteous among their fathers and their spouses and their descendants. And the angels enter upon them from every gate (saying)","13:24":"peace (and well-being) upon you for your perseverance. And how excellent is the final home","13:25":"And those who break God’s promise after committing to it and cut what God ordered it to be joined and commit corruption on the earth, they have the curse upon them and the bad home is for them","13:26":"God increases and decreases the provision for anyone He wants. And they were happy with this world's life, while this world’s life is only a brief joy compared to the hereafter","13:27":"Those who disbelieved say: why a miracle was not sent down to him from his Master? Say: God misguides anyone He wants and guides to Himself anyone who turns to Him","13:28":"Those who believed and their hearts are reassured by remembering God, know that the hearts are reassured by remembering God","13:29":"Those who believed and did good works, happiness and a good place of return is for them","13:30":"As such We sent you to a group that other groups have passed away before them, so that you read to them that which We revealed to you while they disbelieve in the beneficent. Say: He is my Master, there is no god except Him, I put my trust in Him, and my return is to Him","13:31":"If it was a Quran that the mountains was moved by it or the earth was torn into pieces by it or the dead were made to speak by it (they would still not believe in it). No, but all the affairs belong to God. Did not those who believed give up hope (and realized) that if God wants He would guide all the people? And those who disbelieved, catastrophe does not stop to happen to them or to fall near their homes because of what they did, until God’s promise comes. Indeed God does not break His promise","13:32":"And messengers before you were certainly ridiculed, but I gave those who disbelieved some time and then took them (in punishment). How was My punishment","13:33":"Does anyone (other than God) watch over what everyone does? And yet they made partners for God. Say: name them, or do you inform Him about something that He does not know on the earth, or is it (just) superficial word? No, but for those who disbelieved their plot is beautified and they are kept back from the (right) way. And there is no guide for anyone who God misguides","13:34":"They have punishment in this world’s life, and the punishment in the hereafter is certainly harder, and there is no protector for them against God","13:35":"Example of the garden which is promised to those who control themselves is rivers flowing through it, and its food and shade are forever. This is the end of those who control themselves, and the end of the disbelievers is the fire","13:36":"Those We gave them the book are happy because of what was sent down to you, and some among the parties disbelieve in part of it. Say: I am only ordered to serve God and do not associate (any partner) with Him, I invite to Him and the return is to Him","13:37":"That is how We sent it (Quran) down, a ruling (and a law) in Arabic. And if you follow their desires after what came to you from the knowledge, then there is no supporter and no protector for you against God","13:38":"We have certainly sent messengers before you and appointed wives and children for them. And it was not (possible) for a messenger to bring a sign (or a miracle) except with God’s permission. For every period there is a mandate (or a record)","13:39":"God erases and registers what He wants, and the main book is with Him","13:40":"And whether We show you some of that (punishment) which We promise them or We make you die (before that), your only responsibility is the preaching, and the accounting is Our responsibility","13:41":"Did they not see that We come to the land and We reduce it from its sides? And God orders and no one revises/delays His order, and He is quick in accounting","13:42":"And those before them have certainly plotted, but all the plots belong to God. He knows what everyone does. And the disbelievers are going to know who gets the final home (in the hereafter)","13:43":"And those who disbelieved say: you are not a messenger. Say: God and anyone who has knowledge of the book are enough as witness between me and you","14:1":"L.R. (Alif. Lam. Ra.) A book that We sent it down to you, so that you bring the people out of the darkness and into the light with their Master’s permission, the path of the powerful, the praiseworthy","14:2":"God is the One who whatever is in the skies and on the earth belongs to Him. And woe to the disbelievers from a severe punishment","14:3":"Those who like this world's life over the hereafter and obstruct God's way and look for its distortion, they are lost far (from the right path)","14:4":"We did not sent any messenger except in the language of his people, in order to clarify (the message) for them. God misguides anyone He wants, and guides anyone He wants, and He is the powerful, the wise","14:5":"And We have certainly sent Moses with Our signs (saying): bring your people out of the darkness and into the light and remind them of the days of God. Indeed there are signs in that for every patient and thankful (person)","14:6":"And (remember) when Moses said to his people: remember God’s favors upon you when He saved you from Pharaoh’s people who subjected you to the harsh punishment while killing your sons and letting your women live. There was a great trial in that from your Master","14:7":"And when your Master announced: if you are thankful, I shall increase you (and your reward), and if you are ungrateful then indeed My punishment is certainly severe","14:8":"And Moses said: if you and everyone on the earth disbelieve together, God is rich (and has no need) and is praiseworthy","14:9":"Did not the story of those before you come to you, people of Noah and Aad and Thamud and those after them? No one knows them except God. Their messengers brought them the clear proofs, but they returned their hands to their mouth and said: indeed we disbelieve in what you are sent with it, and we are certainly in serious doubt about what you invite us to it","14:10":"Their messengers said: is there any doubt about God, creator of the skies and the earth? He invites you to forgive you of your sins and postpone you (your death and punishment) until a limited period. They said: you are only a human being like us, you want to turn us away from what our fathers used to serve, so bring us a clear reason","14:11":"Their messengers told them: we are only human beings like you, but God favors upon any one of His servants that He wants, and it is not for us to bring you a reason except with God’s permission, and believers should put their trust in God","14:12":"And why should we not put our trust in God, while He has guided us in our ways? And we shall persevere over what you harass us. And those who trust should put their trust in God","14:13":"And those who disbelieved said to their messengers: we shall drive you out of our land or you shall return to our faith. Then their Master revealed to them: We shall destroy the wrongdoers","14:14":"And We shall make you inhabit the land after them. That is for those who fear My position and fear My threat (of punishment)","14:15":"And they asked for victory, and every stubborn tyrant was disappointed","14:16":"Hell is ahead of him, and he is made to drink from rotten water","14:17":"He sips it and does not swallow it easily, and death comes to him from everywhere but he does not die, and beyond it is a severe punishment","14:18":"The works of those who disbelieved in their Master is like ashes that a strong wind blows on it on a stormy day.

Do you take him and his descendants as your supporters instead of Me while they are your enemies. What a bad exchange for the wrongdoers","18:51":"I did not make them witness creation of the skies and the earth or creation of themselves, and I did not take those who misguide as an assistant","18:52":"And on a day when He says call out those whom you claimed to be My partners, then they call on them, but they would not answer them, and We put a steep cliff (and a place of destruction) between them","18:53":"And the guilty ones see the fire and they think that they are to fall into it, and they do not find any escape from it","18:54":"And We have certainly explained every kind of example for people in this Quran. And the human being, more than anything, is argumentative","18:55":"And nothing prevented the people to believe and ask forgiveness from their Master when the guidance came to them except that (they would expect) the ways of the earlier ones come to them or the punishment comes to them face to face","18:56":"We did not send the messengers except as givers of good news and warners. And those who disbelieved argue with falsehood to disprove the truth with it, and they took My signs and what they were warned as a joke","18:57":"And who is more wrong than someone who is reminded of his Master's signs then he stays away from them and forgets what his hands sent ahead (what he did). Indeed We placed a cover on their hearts that they do not understand it (Quran) and a deafness in their ears (so they don't hear it), and if you call them to the guidance they will never ever be guided","18:58":"And your Master is the forgiving, having mercy. If He was to take them to account for what they did, He would have certainly rushed the punishment for them, but there is an appointed time for them, from which they never find a refuge","18:59":"And We destroyed those towns when they did wrong, and We set an appointed time for their destruction","18:60":"And (remember) when Moses said to his young companion: I continue on until I reach the junction of the two seas or I go on for a long time","18:61":"So when they reached the junction of the two (seas), they forgot their fish and it took its way drifting into the sea","18:62":"So when they went beyond (the junction), he said to his young companion: bring us our meal, we have certainly got tired in this trip of ours","18:63":"He said: did you notice that when we stayed on the rock and I forgot the fish, only Satan made me forget to mention it, and it amazingly took its way into the sea","18:64":"He (Moses) said: that is where we were looking for. So they returned backtracking on their footsteps","18:65":"Then they found a servant from Our servants whom We gave him kindness from Us and taught him (some) knowledge from Us","18:66":"Moses said to him: may I follow you that you teach me from what you were taught of good sense (and knowledge)","18:67":"He said: you can never be patient with me","18:68":"how can you be patient about what you are not familiar with any knowledge of it","18:69":"He (Moses) said: God willing, you are going to find me patient and I will not disobey you in any matter","18:70":"He said: so if you follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I bring about mentioning of it for you","18:71":"So they went on until when they got on the boat, and he made a hole in it. He (Moses) said: did you make a hole in it to drown its passengers? You have certainly committed a terrible thing","18:72":"He said: did I not say to you that you can never be patient with me","18:73":"He (Moses) said: forgive me for what I forgot, and do not make me suffer difficulty (and don't be hard on me) in my affair","18:74":"So they went on until when they met a young man, then he killed him. He (Moses) said: did you kill an innocent person without (him killing) a person? You have certainly committed an awful thing","18:75":"He said: did I not say to you that you can never be patient with me","18:76":"He (Moses) said: if I ask you about anything after that, then do not keep me in your company, for you have got an excuse from me","18:77":"So they went on until when they came to inhabitants of a town, they asked its inhabitants for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found a wall in it that was about to fall down, so he set it up straight. He (Moses) said: if you wanted, you could have taken a wage for it","18:78":"He said: this is separation between me and you. I am going to tell you the interpretation of what you could not be patient about it","18:79":"As for the boat, it belonged to some needy people working in the sea, then I decided to damage it because a king was after them who would take every boat by force","18:80":"As for the young man, his parents were believers, and we feared that he would press them to rebellious and disbelief","18:81":"So we wanted that their Master substitute for them a better (son) than him in integrity and closer to kindness","18:82":"And as for the wall, it belonged to two young orphan boys in the city, and under it there was a treasure for them, and their father was righteous, so your Master decided that they should reach their maturity to take out their treasure as a kindness from your Master. And I did not do it on my own accord. This is interpretation of what you could not be patient about it","18:83":"And they ask you about Zul-Qarnain. Say: I am going to recite to you a mention of him","18:84":"Indeed We established him on the earth, and we gave him means of everything","18:85":"Then he followed a way","18:86":"until when he reached where the sun sets, he found (perceived) it setting into a dark murky spring, and found a group of people by it. We said: Zul-Qarnain, would you punish them or would you treat them with goodness","18:87":"He said: as for anyone who does wrong then I will punish him, then he is returned to his Master and He punishes him with an awful punishment","18:88":"and as for anyone who believes and does good work, then there is the good reward for him, and we are going to issue easy order for him","18:89":"Then he followed (another) way","18:90":"until when he reached where the sun rises, he found it rising on a group that We did not make any cover for them other than it (the sun)","18:91":"That is how it was, and We have thoroughly known about what knowledge he had with him of","18:92":"Then he followed (another) way","18:93":"until when he reached between the two obstacles (mountains), beside them he found a group who could hardly understand a word","18:94":"They said: Zul-Qarnain, indeed Ya’juj (Gog) and Ma’juj (Magog) commit corruption on the land, so may we give you a payment, that you make an obstacle between us and them","18:95":"He said: what my Master established me in it is better, so help me with manpower, I make a barricade between you and them","18:96":"Bring me chunks of the iron. Until when he leveled between the two mountains. He said: blow. Until when he made it (look) as a fire. He said: bring me melted copper to pour over it","18:97":"So they (Ya’juj and Ma’juj) could not climb it and they could not dig through it","18:98":"He said: this is a mercy from my Master, so when the promise of my Master comes, He levels it to the ground, and my Master’s promise is true","18:99":"And on that day, We leave some of them roll among others, and the trumpet is blown, then We gather them altogether","18:100":"And on that day, We present hell to the disbelievers, in plain view","18:101":"those whose eyes were in a cover from My remembrance, and they could not hear (the truth)","18:102":"Did those who disbelieved think that they take My servants as their protectors instead of Me? Indeed We prepared hell for the disbelievers as an entertainment","18:103":"Say: should We inform you about the worst losers' actions","18:104":"(Works of) those whose effort is lost in this world’s life and they think indeed they do good work","18:105":"They are those who disbelieved in their Master's signs and in meeting Him (in the hereafter), so their works became useless, and We do not assign any weight to them on the resurrection day","18:106":"That is their payback, hell, because they disbelieved and took My signs and My messengers as a joke","18:107":"Indeed those who believed and did good works, they have gardens of the paradise as an entertainment","18:108":"remaining in there forever, and they will not look for moving from it","18:109":"Say: if the sea becomes ink for (writing) the words of my Master, the sea certainly run out before the words of my Master run out, even if we bring another (sea) like it as help","18:110":"Say: I am only a human being like you, it is revealed to me that your god is the One god, so whoever is hoping to meet his Master, then he should do good work and he should not make any partner in serving his Master","19:1":"H.Y.A.S.

And my Master, make him pleasing","19:7":"(He was told): Zachariah, indeed We give you good news of a boy, his name is Yahya (John the Baptist), We did not give anyone his name (or attribute) in the past","19:8":"He said: my Master, how can there be a son for me while my wife is infertile and I have reached the very old age","19:9":"He (the angel) said: it is so, your Master says: it is easy for Me, and I have created you in the past while you were nothing","19:10":"He said: my Master, give me a sign. He said: your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three nights (being) sound (and healthy)","19:11":"So he went out of the chamber (place of prayer) to his people, and revealed to them (by sign language) to glorify (God) morning and evening","19:12":"Yahya, take the book firmly.

She said: I wish I was dead before this and I was completely forgotten","19:24":"Then (a voice) called her from under her that do not be sad, your Master has placed a stream under you","19:25":"And shake trunk of the palm tree towards you and it drops fresh ripe dates on you","19:26":"So eat and drink and be cheerful. If you see any human being, then say: indeed I pledged a fast for the beneficent, so I never talk to any human being today","19:27":"Then she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said: Mary, you have committed an unprecedented thing","19:28":"Sister of Aaron, your father was not a bad man and your mother was not unchaste","19:29":"Then she pointed to him. They said: how can we talk to any child who is the cradle","19:30":"He said: indeed I am God’s servant, He gave me the book and made me a prophet","19:31":"and He made me blessed wherever I am, and He instructed me to the mandatory prayer and the mandatory charity as long as I live","19:32":"and good (and kind) to my mother, and He did not make me a miserable bully","19:33":"And peace (and well-being) upon me on a day I was born, and a day that I die, and a day I am raised to life","19:34":"That is (the story of) Jesus, son of Mary, a true word that they doubt about it","19:35":"It is not for God to take a child, He is flawless.

Say: it is guidance and a healing for those who believed, and those who do not believe there is deafness in their ears and they are blind about it, (as if) they are called from a faraway place","41:45":"And We have certainly given Moses the book, then they disagreed about it. And if it was not for a word that previously came from your Master, it would have been judged between them. And they are indeed in a serious doubt about it","41:46":"Whoever does good work then it is for himself, and whoever does bad then it is against it, and your Master is not unjust to His servants","41:47":"The knowledge of the hour is referred to Him. And no fruit come out of its coverings, and no female gets pregnant and gives birth without His knowledge. And on a day that He calls them (saying): where are My associates? They say: we notified You that there is no witness among us","41:48":"And what they used to call on in the past abandoned them, and they realize that there is no way (or place) of escape for them","41:49":"The human being does not get tired of praying for the good (things), but if the badness touches him then he becomes hopeless and discouraged","41:50":"And if We make him taste of a mercy from Us after harm touches him, he shall say: this is because of me, and I do not think that the hour is established, and if I am returned to my Master, indeed there is better (things) for me with Him. We shall inform those who disbelieved of what they did, and We shall make them taste from a severe punishment","41:51":"And when We favor upon the human being, he turns away and moves away to his side, and when the badness touches him then he has a lengthy prayer","41:52":"Say: what do you think if it (Quran) is from God and you disbelieve in it, who is more mistaken than someone who is in extreme opposition (to it)","41:53":"We are going to show them Our signs in the horizons (of universe) and in themselves until it is clarified for them that He is the truth. Or is it not enough that your Master is indeed a witness over everything","41:54":"Know that indeed they are in doubt about meeting their Master. Know that indeed He surrounds everything","42:1":"M. (Ha. Mim)","42:2":"S. Q. (Ain. Sin. Qaf)","42:3":"That is how God the powerful, the wise, reveals to you and to those before you","42:4":"Whatever in the skies and whatever on the earth belongs to Him, and He is the superior, the great","42:5":"The skies are about to tear apart from above them, and the angels glorify their Master with praise and ask forgiveness for whoever is on the earth. Know that indeed God is the forgiving, the merciful","42:6":"And those who took protectors (and supporters) other than Him, God is guarding over them, and you are not their advocate","42:7":"And that is how We revealed an Arabic Quran to you, so that you warn (the people of) the mother of the towns (Mecca) and its vicinity, and you warn of the day of assembly which there is no doubt in it, a group in the garden and a group in the burning fire","42:8":"And if God wanted, He would have made you a single community (of faith), but He admits anyone He wants into His mercy. And the wrongdoers have no protector and no helper","42:9":"Or did they take protectors other than God? Whereas God is the protector and He gives life to the dead and He is capable of everything","42:10":"And anything you disagree about it, then its judgment (and decision) is with God. That is God, my Master, I trust in Him and I return to Him (in repentance)","42:11":"Creator of the skies and the earth, He made spouses for you from yourselves, as well as mates for the livestock, by which He multiplies (and disperses) you in it. There is nothing like Him, and He hears all, sees all","42:12":"The keys of the skies and the earth belong to Him, He increases and decreases the provision for anyone He wants. Indeed He knows everything","42:13":"He legislated for you the religion (way of life) that He instructed Noah to it, and that which We revealed to you, and what We instructed Abraham and Moses and Jesus to it, to uphold the religion and do not become divided in it. What you invite them to it, is difficult for the polytheists. God chooses anyone He wants for Himself, and He guides to Himself anyone who turns (in repentance)","42:14":"And they only became divided after the knowledge came to them because of jealousy between them. And if it was not for a word that previously came from your Master for a limited period, it would have been judged between them. And indeed those who were made to inherit the book after them are in a serious doubt about it","42:15":"So invite for that (observing religion and not being divided in it), and stand firm as you were ordered, and do not follow their desires, and say: I believed in whatever book/mandate that God sent down, and I am ordered to be just (and fair) between you, God is our Master and your Master, our deeds for us and your deeds for you, there is no argument between us and you, God brings us together, and the final return is to Him","42:16":"And those who argue about God after they answered to Him, their argument is invalid with their Master, and anger (of God) is upon them, and a severe punishment is for them","42:17":"God is the One who sent down the book and the scale (of good and bad) with truth. And how would you know, the hour may be near","42:18":"Those who do not believe in it want to rush it, and those who believed are afraid of it and they know that it is indeed the truth. Know that those who dispute about the hour are indeed lost far (from the right path)","42:19":"God is nice to His servants, He provides for anyone He wants, and He is the strong, the powerful","42:20":"Anyone who desires the harvest of the hereafter, We increase his harvest for him, and anyone who desires the harvest of this world, We give him from it, but in the hereafter there is no portion for him","42:21":"Or do they have associates who legislate part of the religion for them, which God did not permit it? And if it was not for the decisive word (of God), it would have been judged between them. And indeed the wrongdoers have a painful punishment","42:22":"You see the wrongdoers are afraid because of what they earned, and it (punishment) happens to them. And those who believed and did good works are in meadows of the gardens, they have whatever they want with their Master. That is the great bounty","42:23":"That is what God gives good news (of it) to His servants, those who believed and did good works. Say: I do not ask you for any wage except for the love among the close ones (or the love of the closeness to God). And whoever commits a good deed, We increase its goodness for him. Indeed God is forgiving, appreciative","42:24":"Or do they say: he made up a lie (and attributes it) to God? Then if God wants, He would seal your heart, but God eliminates the falsehood and proves the truth with His words. Indeed He knows what is inside the chests","42:25":"And He is the One who accepts the repentance from His servants and excuses the bad deeds and knows what you do","42:26":"And He answers those who believed and did good works, and He gives them more from His grace (and bounty), and the disbelievers have a severe punishment","42:27":"And if He increases the provision of His servants, they would certainly commit injustice on the earth, but He sends down in amount that He wants. Indeed He is well informed and observant about His servants","42:28":"And He is the One who sends down the rain after they lost hope and He spreads His mercy. And He is the praiseworthy protector","42:29":"And among His signs is creation of the skies and the earth and whatever creature He scattered in them. And He is capable of bringing them together when He wants","42:30":"And whatever tragedy happens to you is because of what your hands have done, and He excuses a lot","42:31":"And you cannot weaken/escape (God) on the earth, and there is no protector or helper for you other than God","42:32":"And among His signs are the sailing ships in the sea like the mountains/road signs","42:33":"If He wants He makes the wind stand still, then they would become motionless on its back (sea's surface). Indeed there are signs in that for every patient and thankful (person)","42:34":"Or He would destroy them for what they did, but He forgives a lot","42:35":"And those who argue about Our signs should know that they have no way (or place) to escape","42:36":"So everything you were given is an enjoyment of this world's life, but what is with God is better and more lasting for those who believed and trust in their Master","42:37":"and those who avoid the great sins and indecencies, and they forgive when they are angry","42:38":"and those who answered (the call of) their Master, and performed the mandatory prayer, and (conducted) their affairs by consultation among them, and spend (in God's way) from what We provided them","42:39":"And those who defend themselves (or take revenge) when they suffer an injustice","42:40":"(should know that) punishment of a bad deed is a bad deed like it, and anyone who excuses and settles then his reward is upon God. Indeed He does not like the wrongdoers","42:41":"And certainly anyone who defends himself (or takes revenge), then there is no way against them","42:42":"The way is only against those who do wrong to the people and unjustifiably commit injustice on the earth. They have a painful punishment","42:43":"And anyone who is patient and forgives, indeed that is because of great determination (and willpower)","42:44":"And whomever God misguides then he has no protector after Him. And you see the wrongdoers when they see the punishment, saying: is there any way to return","42:45":"And you see them presented to it (the fire) humiliated from the disgrace, looking with a secret glance. And those who believed say: indeed the losers are those who lose themselves and their families on the resurrection day. Know that indeed the wrongdoers are in a lasting punishment","42:46":"And there is no protector to help them other than God. And whomever God misguides, he has no way","42:47":"Answer your Master before a day comes that it has no turning back by God. On that day there is no refuge for you and there is no denial for you","42:48":"But if they stay away, We have not sent you as their guardian, you are only responsible for the preaching. And indeed when We make the human being taste from Our mercy he enjoys it, but if they suffer a tragedy because of what their hands sent ahead then indeed the human being is ungrateful","42:49":"The rule of the skies and the earth belongs to God. He creates what He wants. He gives daughters to anyone He wants and gives the sons to anyone He wants","42:50":"Or He combines them (giving them) sons and daughters and sons, and He makes anyone He wants infertile. Indeed He is knowledgeable and capable","42:51":"And it is not for any human being that God speaks to him, except through revelation or from behind a barrier or by sending a messenger (angel) to reveal what He wants with His permission. God is indeed superior, wise","42:52":"And like that We revealed to you a spirit by Our command. You did not used to know what the book or the belief/faith is, but We made it (Quran) a light and We guide anyone of Our servants that We want with it. And indeed you guide to a straight path (by this Quran)","42:53":"path of God, the One that whatever in the skies and on the earth belongs to Him. Know that all affairs wind up with God","43:1":"M. (Ha. Mim)","43:2":"By the clear (and clarifying) book","43:3":"Indeed We made it an Arabic Quran so that you may understand","43:4":"And it is indeed in the main book with Us, (and it is) outstanding and wise","43:5":"Should We take the reminder away from you, ignoring you because you are excessive people","43:6":"And how many prophets did We send among the earlier ones","43:7":"And no prophet came to them, unless they were ridiculing him","43:8":"So We destroyed more courageous (and more powerful people) than them, and the example of the earlier ones passed by","43:9":"And if you ask them: who created the skies and the earth? They shall say: the powerful and the knowledgeable created them","43:10":"The One who made the earth a bed for you and He made roadways for you in it so that you may be guided (and find your way)","43:11":"And the One who sent down rain from the sky with (proper) measure, then We brought dead land back to life with it. That is how you are brought out","43:12":"And the One who created pairs of everything, and made the ships and the livestock for you to ride","43:13":"So that you settle on its back, then when you are settled on it remember the favor of your Master and say: glory to the One (who is flawless) who brought this under our control (to be of service to us) while we were not capable of it","43:14":"And we certainly return to our Master","43:15":"And they made a part (an offspring) for Him from His servants. Indeed the human being is clearly ungrateful","43:16":"Did He take daughters (for Himself) from what He creates, and He chose sons for you","43:17":"And when one of them is given good news of what he assigns to the beneficent, his face turns dark (and shameful) while he holds back his anger","43:18":"Or (do they assign to God) someone who is raised in luxury, and who is unclear in the debate","43:19":"And they made the angels, those who are servants of the beneficent, females! Did they witness their creation? Their testimony is going to be written down and they will be questioned","43:20":"And they said: if the beneficent wanted, we would not have served them. They have no knowledge of that, they only guess","43:21":"Or did We give them a book before it, which they are adhering to it","43:22":"No, but they said: we found our fathers on a course, and we are guided by their footsteps","43:23":"And the same way, We did not send any town anyone as a warner before you, unless its rich (and wealthy) said: we found our fathers on a course, and we are following their footsteps","43:24":"He (the warner) said: even if I have brought you a better guidance than what you found your fathers upon it? They said: we disbelieve in what you were sent with it","43:25":"Then We took revenge from them, so see what the end of those who denied was","43:26":"And (remember) when Abraham told his father and his people: I am free of what you serve","43:27":"except the One who created me, indeed He is going to guide me","43:28":"And he made it a lasting word among his descendants so that they may return (to God)","43:29":"No, but I made these and their fathers enjoy until the truth and a clarifying messenger came to them","43:30":"And when the truth came to them, they said: this is a magic and we are disbelievers in it","43:31":"And they said: why this Quran was not sent down to a great man from the two towns (Mecca and Taif)","43:32":"Do they divide up (and distribute) your Master’s mercy? We divided their livelihood (and wealth) between them in this world’s life. And We raised some of them above the others in ranks so that some of them take the others into service. And your Master’s mercy is better than what they accumulate","43:33":"And if it was not that the people would become a single community (of disbelievers), We would have made houses, for anyone who disbelieves in the beneficent, with silver roofs and (silver) ladders to go up on it","43:34":"and (silver) doors for their houses and (silver) couches that they lean on it","43:35":"and (gold) ornament. And all that is only an enjoyment of this world’s life while the hereafter with your Master is for those who control themselves","43:36":"And anyone who is blind about remembrance of the beneficent, We appoint a devil to him to be close to him","43:37":"and indeed they shall obstruct them from the (right) way, and they think they are guided","43:38":"Until when he comes to Us, saying: I wish there was distance of the two easts (the east and the west) between you (the appointed devil) and me, what a bad companion","43:39":"And (you regret) never benefits you today, since you did wrong, indeed you are partners in the punishment","43:40":"Can you make the deaf hear, or guide the blind and anyone who is in an obvious error","43:41":"So if We take you away (from this world), then indeed We take revenge from them","43:42":"Or (if) We show you that which We promised them, then We indeed have power over them (to do that)","43:43":"So hold on to that which We revealed to you, indeed you are on a straight path","43:44":"And indeed it (Quran) is a reminder for you and for your people, and you will be questioned","43:45":"And ask (the followers of) Our messengers whom We sent before you: did We appoint any gods to be served other than the beneficent","43:46":"And We have certainly sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his assembly, then he said: I am a messenger from the Master of Human kind","43:47":"But when he brought them Our miracles, they laughed at it","43:48":"And We did not show them any miracle unless it was bigger than its sister (the one before it). And We took them with the punishment so that they may return","43:49":"And they said: magician, call on your Master for us according to His agreement with you, as we are indeed guided","43:50":"But when We removed the punishment from them, they immediately broke (their promise)","43:51":"And Pharaoh called out among his people, saying: my people, does not the rule of Egypt belong to me as do these rivers flowing underneath me? Do you not see","43:52":"Am I not better than this one who is despicable and cannot express (himself) clearly","43:53":"So why bracelets of gold were not given to him or the angels did not come accompanying him","43:54":"Then he belittled his people and they obeyed him. Indeed they were disobedient people","43:55":"So when they enraged Us, We took revenge from them and drowned them all","43:56":"So We made them a thing of the past and an example for the later ones","43:57":"And when the son of Mary (Jesus) was given as an example, your people turned away from it (laughing and shouting)","43:58":"And they said: are our gods better or is he? They only gave you (this example) to argue. No, but they are argumentative people","43:59":"He (Jesus) was only a servant whom We favored upon him and We made him an example for children of Israel","43:60":"And if We wanted, We would have made some of you angels on the earth, to succeed you","43:61":"And it is certainly an indication of the hour, so do not doubt it, and follow Me. This is a straight path","43:62":"And do not let Satan hold you up, as he is indeed your clear enemy","43:63":"And when Jesus brought the clear proofs, he said: I have certainly brought you the wisdom to clarify for you some of that which you disagree about it, so be cautious of God and obey me","43:64":"Indeed God is He who is my Master and your Master, so serve Him. This is a straight path","43:65":"But the parties disagreed among themselves, so woe to those who did wrong from punishment of a painful day","43:66":"Do they wait (for anything) except the hour to come to them suddenly, while they do not realize","43:67":"On that day, the friends are enemy of each other except those who controlled themselves","43:68":"My servants, there is no fear for you today, and you will not be sad","43:69":"Those who believed in Our signs and were submitted","43:70":"you and your spouses enter the garden, being delighted","43:71":"Golden plates and drinking glasses are circulated for them, and whatever the soul desires and pleases the eyes is in there, and you remain in it forever","43:72":"And this is the garden that you are made to inherit because of what you were doing","43:73":"There are plenty of fruits for you to eat in it","43:74":"Indeed the guilty ones remain in the punishment of hell forever","43:75":"It is not reduced for them and they are hopeless in it","43:76":"We did not wrong them, but they were the wrongdoers","43:77":"And they call out: master (of hell), have your Master finish us off. He says: indeed you are staying","43:78":"We have certainly brought you the truth, but most of you dislike the truth","43:79":"Or did they firmly settle on an issue, then indeed We are firmly settled too","43:80":"Or do they think that We do not hear their secret and their whisper? Yes (We hear them), and Our messengers are with them writing","43:81":"Say: if there was a child for the beneficent, then I would be the first of the servants","43:82":"Master of the skies and the earth, Master of the throne is flawless (and beyond) what they describe","43:83":"So leave them talk uselessly and play until they meet their day which they are promised","43:84":"And He is the One who is god in the skies and god in the earth, and He is the wise, the knowledgeable","43:85":"And blessed is the One that the rule of the skies and the earth and whatever between them belongs to Him, and the knowledge of the hour is with Him, and you are returned to Him","43:86":"And those you call on besides Him have no power of the mediation, except whoever testifies with the truth, and they know (the truth)","43:87":"And if you ask them who created them? They shall say: God. So how do they deviate","43:88":"And his saying was: my Master, indeed these people do not believe","43:89":"(God said:) so pardon/ignore them and say peace (and well-being), they will know","44:1":"M.

And a wall having a gate is put up between them, its interior has mercy in it while its exterior has the punishment facing it","57:14":"They (the disbelievers) call on them (the believers): were we not with you? they say: yes, but you tempted yourselves and you waited and you doubted, and wishful thinking deceived you until God’s command came and the deceiver (Satan) deceived you about God","57:15":"So today no ransom is taken from you and from those who disbelieved, your housing is the fire, it is your sponsor and it is a bad destination","57:16":"Is it not about time for those who believed to humble their hearts for God’s remembrance and what came down from the truth, and do not be like those who were given the book in the past, and then after some time passed for them their hearts hardened and many of them were disobedient","57:17":"Know that God brings the earth back to life after its death. We certainly made the signs clear for you, so that you may understand","57:18":"The charitable men and the charitable women and those who lend God a good loan (or offer God a good deed), it (their reward) is multiplied for them and a noble (and generous) reward is for them","57:19":"And those who believed in God and His messenger, they are the truthful and witnesses before their Master, they have their reward and their light. And those who disbelieved and denied Our signs, they are inhabitants of the hellfire","57:20":"Know that this world’s life is only play and amusement, and decoration and show off among yourselves, and wanting more in the wealth and the children. It is like the example of a rain that its plant growth impresses the farmers, then it dries up and you see it turn yellow and then becomes broken pieces. And in the hereafter there is severe punishment (for the disbelievers) and forgiveness and pleasure of God (for the believers). And this world’s life is only means of the deception","57:21":"Race to forgiveness of your Master, and a garden whose width is as wide as the sky and the earth, and is prepared for those who believed in God and His messengers. That is God’s grace that He gives it to anyone He wants. And God has enormous grace","57:22":"No tragedy happens on the earth or within yourselves unless it is in a book before We create it (according to God's laws). This is easy for God","57:23":"So that you do not be sad over what slips away from you (or what you lose) and not to be overjoyed about what He gives you. And God does not like any selfish show off","57:24":"those who are stingy and order people to the stinginess. And anyone who turns back, God is indeed the rich (without any need) and the praiseworthy","57:25":"We have certainly sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and sent down the book and the balance (of right and wrong) with them so that people carry out justice. And We sent down the iron in which there is a great badness and benefits for the people, and for God to know anyone who helps Him and His messenger in the secret. God is indeed strong and powerful","57:26":"And We have certainly sent Noah and Abraham and We put the prophethood and the book among their descendants, so some of them were guided, and most of them were disobedient","57:27":"Then We followed them up with Our messengers, and We sent Jesus son of Mary and We gave him the Gospel, and put gentleness and mercy in the heart of those who followed him. But they made up being monks, We did not mandate it to them, but (We mandated) looking for God's pleasure, but they did not observe it as it was supposed to be observed. Then we gave those among them who believed their reward, while most of them are disobedient","57:28":"You who believe, be cautious of God and believe in His messenger, that He gives you a double portion of His mercy and makes a light for you to walk with it and forgives you. He is forgiving and merciful","57:29":"So that people of the book know that they do not have a bit of power over God’s grace, and that the grace is in God’s hand, giving it to anyone He wants. God has enormous grace","58:1":"God has heard word of the one who argues with you about her husband and complains to God. God heard your conversation, indeed God hears all and sees all","58:2":"Those of you who divorce their wives by declaring them as their mothers, they are not their mothers. No one is their mothers except those who gave them birth, and they certainly say a nasty word and a lie. And God certainly pardons and forgives","58:3":"And those who divorce their wives by declaring them as their mother, then they go back on what they said, should free a slave before touching each other. This is what you are advised to it. And God is well informed of what you do","58:4":"And if someone does not find (a slave) then fasting for two consecutive months before touching each other.

And We have sent down clear signs, and for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment","58:6":"A day that God raises them all, then He informs them of what they did, as God counted it while they forgot it. And God witnesses everything","58:7":"Did you not see that God knows whatever is in the skies and whatever is on the earth? There is not any whispering of three unless He is the fourth of them, and not of any five unless He is the sixth of them, and no less or no more than this unless He is with them, wherever they are. Then on the resurrection day He informs them of what they did. Indeed God knows everything","58:8":"Did you not see those who were prohibited from whispering, then they returned to what they were prohibited from it, while whispering about sin and enmity and disobedience of the messenger? And when they come to you, they greet you in such a way that God has not greeted you with it, and they say among themselves: why does not God punish us for what we say? Hell is enough for them, they enter (and burn in) it, and it is a bad destination","58:9":"You who believe, when you whisper to each other, do not whisper about sin and enmity and disobedience of the messenger, but whisper about goodness and self control, and be cautious of God, the One you are gathered to Him","58:10":"The whisper is only from Satan to make those who believed sad, while it does not harm them a bit unless with God's permission. And the believers should put their trust in God","58:11":"You who believe, when you are told to make room in the assemblies, then make room so that God makes room for you, and when it is said to get up, then get up. God raises ranks of those among you who believed and those who were given the knowledge. And God is well informed of what you do","58:12":"You who believe, when you whisper to the messenger, then give to charity before your whispering. This is better and purer for you. And if you did not find (it affordable), then indeed God is forgiving and merciful","58:13":"Were you afraid of giving to charity before your whispering? So when you did not do it and God turned to you (and forgave you), then perform the mandatory prayer and give to the mandatory charity and obey God and His messenger. God is well informed of what you do","58:14":"Did you not see those who turn (in friendship) to people whom God's anger is upon them? They are not from you and (you are) not from them, and they swear falsely while they know","58:15":"God prepared a severe punishment for them, for what they were doing is indeed bad","58:16":"They took their oath as a shield to obstruct (people) from God's way, so they have a humiliating punishment","58:17":"Their possessions and children are of no use against God at all. They are inhabitants of the fire, remaining in there forever","58:18":"On a day that God raises them all, then they swear for Him as they swear for you, and they think that they are on to something. Know that indeed they are liars","58:19":"Satan overcame them and made them forget God's remembrance, they are Satan's party. Know that indeed Satan's party, they are the losers","58:20":"Indeed those who oppose God and His messenger, they are among the lowest ones","58:21":"God prescribed: I and My messengers shall be victorious. God is indeed strong and powerful","58:22":"You do not find any group who believe in God and the last day that they love those who oppose God and His messenger, even if they are their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their family (and tribe members). He wrote the belief in their hearts and He assisted them with a spirit from Him, and He admits them to gardens which rivers flow through them, remaining in there forever. God is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, they are God's party. Know that God's party, they are indeed the successful ones","59:1":"Whatever is in the skies and whatever is on the earth glorify God, and He is the powerful, the wise","59:2":"He is the One who drove out those who disbelieved among the people of the book from their homes for the first forced emigration. You did not think that they would leave. And they thought that their fortresses would protect them against God, but God came to them from where they did not expect, and He threw horror in their hearts. They destroyed their homes with their own hands and the believers' hands. So you who have insight, learn a lesson","59:3":"And if God had not prescribed the evacuation for them, He would have certainly punished them in this world, and they have punishment of the fire in the hereafter","59:4":"That is because they opposed God and His messenger, and whoever opposes God, then God is indeed severe in the punishment","59:5":"Any palm tree that you cut down or you left it standing on its roots, it is by God's permission so that He humiliates the disobedient","59:6":"And whatever God gave to His messenger as spoil from them, you did not bother (riding) any horse or camel for it, but God makes His messengers dominate over whomever He wants. And God is capable of everything","59:7":"And whatever God gave to His messenger as spoil from people of the towns is for God and for the messenger and for the relatives (and close ones) and the orphans and the needy and the traveler (in need) so that it does not circulate between the rich among you. And whatever the messenger gave you then take it, and whatever he held you back from it then stay away from it, and be cautious of God. God is indeed severe in the punishment","59:8":"And (part of it is) for the poor immigrants, those who were driven out of their homes and their possessions and they look for God’s bounty and His pleasure and they help God and His messenger. They are the truthful ones","59:9":"And (part of it is for) those who settled down in the houses (in Medina) and in the faith before them, and they like anyone who emigrated to them, and they do not find any need in their minds for what they were given, and they prefer them over themselves even though poverty is among them. And anyone who restrains his own stinginess (and greed), then they are the successful ones","59:10":"And those who came after them say: our Master, forgive us and our brothers who came to faith before us, and do not put any resentment in our hearts toward those who believed, Our Master, you are gentle and merciful","59:11":"Did you not see those hypocrites who say to their brothers who disbelieved among people of the book: if you are driven out we shall leave with you, and we would never obey anyone about you, and we shall help you if you are fought. God testifies that they are certainly liars","59:12":"If they are driven out they would not leave with them, and if they are fought they will not help them, and if they (want to) help them, they shall turn their backs (and run away), then they are not helped","59:13":"You are certainly more frightening than God in their minds. That is because they are a group who do not understand","59:14":"They do not fight you altogether unless in well protected towns or from behind walls. Their hostility among them is severe. You think they are all together (and united) while their hearts are divided. That is because they are a group who do not understand","59:15":"Same as those before them in the near past, they tasted the bad result of their affair, and they have a painful punishment","59:16":"Same as Satan when he says to the human being: disbelieve. Then when he disbelieves, he (Satan) says: I am free of you (and have nothing to do with you), I fear God, Master of humankind","59:17":"The end of both of them is in the fire, remaining in there forever, and that is the penalty of the wrongdoers","59:18":"You who believe, be cautious of God, and everyone should watch what he sends ahead for tomorrow, and be cautious of God. God is well informed of what you do","59:19":"And do not be like those who forgot God, so He made them forget themselves. They are the disobedient ones","59:20":"Inhabitants of the fire and inhabitants of the garden are not equal. Inhabitants of the garden, they are the winners","59:21":"If We had sent down this Quran to a mountain, you would have certainly seen it humbly breaking up from fear of God.

They have disbelieved in what came to you in truth, driving the messenger and yourselves out because you believe in God your Master. If you go out to try hard in My way and look for My pleasure, why do you secretly offer them the friendship, while I know what you hide and what you disclose. And whoever among you does it, he has lost the even way","60:2":"If they overcome you, they become your enemies and they extend their hands and their tongues towards you with bad (intentions), and they wish that you disbelieve","60:3":"Your blood relatives (and close relatives) and your children will never benefit you on the resurrection day as He separates you, and God sees whatever you do","60:4":"There has been a good example for you in Abraham and those with him when they said to their people: we are free of (and have nothing to do with) you and whatever you serve other than God, we disbelieve in you, and an unending enmity and hatred started between us and you until you believe in God alone.

So if you find them as believing women, then do not return them to the disbelievers, they are not lawful for them (the disbelievers) and they (the disbelievers) are not lawful for them, and give them (the disbelievers) what they spent (for these women). And there is no blame on you if you marry them when you give them their compensations (marriage portions). And do not hold on to the (marriage) ties of disbelieving women, and ask for what you spent and they should ask for what they spent. This is God's command, He judges between you.

While God knows that indeed you are His messenger, and God testifies that the hypocrites are certainly liars","63:2":"They took their oath as a shield, then obstructed (people) from God's way. Indeed what they were doing is bad","63:3":"That is because they believed, then disbelieved, so their hearts were sealed so that they do not understand","63:4":"And when you see them, their bodies impress you, and if they speak you listen to their speech, as if they are lumbers leaned (against a wall), they think that every noise is against them.
