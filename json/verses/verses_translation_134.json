How steadfastly they seek the Fire","2:176":"That is because God has revealed the Book with the Truth; those that disagree about it are in extreme schism","2:177":"Righteousness does not consist in whether you turn your face to the East or to the West. The righteous are those who believes in God and the Last Day, in the angels and the Book and the prophets; who, though they love it dearly, gives their wealth to kin, to orphans, to the destitute, to the traveller in need and to beggars, and for the redemption of captives; who attend to their prayers and renders the alms levy; who are true to their promises and steadfast in trial and adversity and in times of war. Such are the true believers; such are the God-fearing","2:178":"Believers, retaliation is decreed for you in bloodshed: a free man for a free man, a slave for a slave, and a female for a female.

I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he calls to Me; therefore let them answer My call and put their trust in Me, that they may be rightly guided","2:187":"It is now lawful for you to lie with your wives on the night of the fast; they are a comfort to you as you are a comfort to them. God knew that you were deceiving yourselves. He has relented towards you and pardoned you. Therefore you may now lie with them and seek what God has ordained for you. Eat and drink until you can tell a white thread from a black one in the light of the coming dawn. Then resume the fast till nightfall and do not approach them, when you should be preoccupied with your prayers in the mosques. These are the bounds set by God: do not approach them.

God does not love the aggressors","2:191":"Slay them wherever you find them. Drive them out of the places from which they drove you. Idolatry is more grievous than bloodshed.

If in peacetime anyone among you combines the Visit with the Pilgrimage, he must offer such gifts as he can afford; but if he lacks the means let him fast three days during the Pilgrimage and seven when he has returned; that is, ten days in all. That is incumbent on him whose family are not present at the Holy Mosque. Have fear of God, and know that God is stern in retribution","2:197":"The Pilgrimage shall be made in the appointed months.

God is forgiving and compassionate","2:200":"And when you have fulfilled your sacred duties, remember God as you remember your forefathers or with deeper reverence.

Then God sent forth prophets to give them joyful tidings and to warn them, and with these He sent down the Book with the Truth, that it might serve as arbiter in people‘s disputes.

So God guided by His will those who believed in the Truth which had been disputed. God guides whom He will to a straight path","2:214":"Or did you suppose that you would enter Paradise untouched by the suffering endured by those before you?

We recite them to you in all truth; and one of Our emissaries you surely are","2:253":"Of these emissaries We have exalted some above others. To some God spoke; others He raised to a lofty status.

If the debtor be an ignorant or feeble-minded person, or one who cannot dictate, let his guardian dictate for him in fairness. Call in two male witnesses from among you, but if two men cannot be found, then one man and two women whom you judge fit to act as witnesses; so that if either of them make an error, the other will remind her. Witnesses shall not refuse if called upon to give evidence. So do not fail to put your debts in writing, be they small or large, together with the date of payment. This is more just in the sight of God; it ensures accuracy in testifying and is the best way to remove all doubt. But if the transaction be a bargain concluded on the spot, it is no offence for you if you do not put it into writing.

You are forbidden to settle disputes by consulting the Arrows. That is a pernicious practice. The unbelievers have this day abandoned all hope of vanquishing your religion.

He that denies the Faith shall gain nothing from his labours; and in the world to come he will surely be among the lost","5:6":"Believers, when you rise to pray wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbow, and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankle. If you are unclean, cleanse yourselves. But if you are sick or on a journey, or if, when you have just relieved yourselves or had intercourse with women, you can find no water, take some clean sand and rub your faces and your hands with it. God does not wish to inconvenience you; but He seeks only to purify you and to perfect His favour to you, so that you may give thanks","5:7":"Remember God‘s favour to you, and the covenant with which He bound you when you said: ‘We hear and obey.‘ Fear God; God knows your innermost thoughts","5:8":"Believers, fulfil your duties to God and bear true witness.

And know that God is with the righteous","9:37":"The postponement of sacred months is a grossly impious practice, in which the unbelievers are misguided. They make it lawful one year and make it unlawful in the next, in order to make up for the months which God has sanctified; thus making lawful what God has forbidden.

Because they doubt, they waver","9:46":"Had they intended to set forth, they would have prepared themselves for the march. But God was loath to let them go, and held them back. They were bidden to stay with those who stayed behind","9:47":"Had they taken the field with you, they would have only added to your burden. They would have wormed their way through your ranks, seeking to sow discord among you: and among you there were some who would have been willing listeners.

You people! It is your own souls that you are corrupting. Take your enjoyment in this life: to Us shall you then return, and We will declare to you all that you have done","10:24":"This present life is like the rich garment with which the earth adorns itself when watered by the rain We send down from the sky.

God is cognizant of what they do","10:37":"This Koran could not have been devised by any but God. Indeed, its confirmation of what was revealed before it, and its expounding of the Book, are beyond doubt from the Lord of the Universe","10:38":"If they say: ‘He invented it himself,‘ say: ‘Bring one sūrah like it. Call on whom you will besides God to help you, if what you say be true!‘","10:39":"Indeed, they disbelieve what they cannot grasp, for they have not yet seen its prophecy fulfilled.

We bestow Our mercy on whom We will, and never deny the righteous their reward","12:57":"Surely better is the recompense of the life to come for those who believe in God and fear Him","12:58":"Joseph‘s brothers came and presented themselves before him. He recognized them, but they knew him not","12:59":"And when he had given them their provisions, he said: ‘Bring me a brother of yours from your father. Do you not see that I give just measure and am the best of hosts","12:60":"If you refuse to bring him to me, you shall have no measure here, nor shall you come near me.‘","12:61":"They replied: ‘We will endeavour to fetch him from his father. This we will surely do.‘","12:62":"He said to his servants: ‘Put their silver¹ into their packs, so that they may discover it when they return to their people. Perchance they will come back.‘","12:63":"When they returned to their father, they said: ‘Father, corn is henceforth denied us. Send our brother with us and we shall have our measure. We will take good care of him.‘","12:64":"He said: ‘Am I to trust you with him as I once trusted you with his brother? But God is the best of guardians: and of all those that show mercy He is the most merciful.‘","12:65":"When they opened their packs, they discovered that their silver had been returned to them. ‘Father,‘ they said, ‘what more can we desire? Here is our silver returned to us. We will buy provisions for our people, and take good care of our brother. We should receive an extra camel-load; a camel-load should be easy enough.‘","12:66":"He replied: ‘I will not send him with you until you promise in God‘s name to bring him back to me, unless the worst befall you.‘ And when they had given him their pledge, he said: ‘God is the witness of what we say","12:67":"My sons, do not enter from one gate; enter from different gates. In no way can I shield you from the might of God; judgement is God‘s alone. In Him I have put my trust. In Him let the trustful put their trust.‘","12:68":"And when they entered as their father bade them, he could in no way shield them from the might of God. It was but a wish in Jacob‘s soul which he had thus fulfilled. He was possessed of knowledge which We had given him. But the greater part of mankind have no knowledge","12:69":"When they went in to Joseph, he embraced his brother, and said: ‘I am your brother. Do not grieve at what they did.‘","12:70":"And when he had provided them with their provisions, he hid a drinking-cup in his brother‘s pack. Then a crier called: ‘Travellers, you are surely thieves!‘","12:71":"They turned back to them, and said: ‘What have you lost?‘","12:72":"We miss the King‘s drinking-cup,‘ they said. ‘He that brings it shall have a camel-load. I pledge my word for it.‘","12:73":"In God‘s name,‘ they said, ‘you know we did not come to do evil in the land. We are no thieves.‘","12:74":"They said: ‘What punishment shall be his, if you prove to be lying?‘","12:75":"They said: ‘He in whose pack the cup is found shall penalize himself for what he did. Thus do we punish the wrongdoers.‘","12:76":"He searched their bags before his brother‘s, and then took out the cup from his brother‘s bag. Thus did We devise it for Joseph: by the king‘s law he had no right to seize his brother: but God willed otherwise. We exalt whom We will to a lofty station: and above those that have knowledge there is One who is all-knowing","12:77":"They said: ‘If he has stolen ― know then that a brother of his did steal before him.‘ But Joseph kept his secret and revealed nothing to them. He said: ‘Your deed was worse. God best knows the things you speak of.‘","12:78":"They said: ‘Noble prince, he has an aged father; take one of us, instead of him. We can see you are a man of virtue","12:79":"He said: ‘God forbid that we should take any but the man with whom our property was found: for then we should surely be unjust.‘","12:80":"When they despaired of him, they went aside to confer in private. Their eldest said: ‘Do you not know that your father took from you a pledge in God‘s name, and that long before you did your worst with Joseph? I will not stir from the land until my father gives me leave or God makes known to me His judgement","12:81":"He is the best of judges. Return to your father and say to him: Father, your son has stolen. We testify only to what we know: we could not guard against the unforeseen","12:82":"Inquire at the city where we lodged, and from the caravan we travelled with. We surely speak the truth.\"‘","12:83":"No!‘ cried their father. ‘Your souls have tempted you to evil. But I will have sweet patience. God may bring them all to me: He alone is all-knowing and wise.‘","12:84":"And he turned away from them, crying: ‘Alas for Joseph!‘ His eyes went white with grief, and he was oppressed with silent sorrow","12:85":"They said: ‘In God‘s name, will you not cease to remember Joseph until you ruin your health and die?‘","12:86":"He said: ‘I complain only to God of my sorrow and sadness; God has made known to me things that you know not","12:87":"Go, my sons, and seek news of Joseph and his brother. And do not despair of God‘s spirit; none but unbelievers despair of God‘s spirit.‘","12:88":"And when they went in to him, they said: ‘Noble Prince, we and our people are scourged with famine. We have brought but little money. Give us our full measure, and be charitable to us: God surely rewards the charitable.‘","12:89":"Do you know,‘ he said, ‘what you did to Joseph and his brother? You are surely unaware.‘","12:90":"They said: ‘Can you indeed be Joseph?‘ ‘I am Joseph,‘ he said, ‘and this is my brother. God has been gracious to us. Those that fear God and endure with fortitude, God will not deny the virtuous their reward.‘","12:91":"‘By the Lord,‘ they said, ‘God has exalted you above us all. We have indeed done wrong.‘","12:92":"He said: ‘None shall reproach you this day. May God forgive you: of all those that show mercy He is the most merciful","12:93":"Take this shirt of mine and throw it over my father‘s face: he will recover his sight. Then return to me with your people all.‘","12:94":"When the caravan departed their father said: ‘I feel the breath of Joseph, though you will not believe me.‘","12:95":"‘By the Lord,‘ they said, ‘you are surely under your old illusion.‘","12:96":"And when the bearer of joyful tidings arrived, he threw Joseph‘s shirt over the old man‘s face, and he regained his sight. He said: ‘Did I not tell you, God has made known to me what you know not?‘","12:97":"They said: ‘Father, implore forgiveness for our sins. We have indeed done wrong.‘","12:98":"He said: ‘I shall implore my Lord to forgive you. He it is who is the Forgiving, the Compassionate One.‘","12:99":"And when they went in to Joseph, he embraced his parents and said: ‘Welcome to Egypt, safe, if God wills!‘","12:100":"He helped his parents to the throne, and they all fell on their knees and prostrated themselves before him. ‘This,‘ he said to his father, ‘is the meaning of my old vision: my Lord has fulfilled it. He has been gracious to me; He has released me from prison, and brought you out of the desert after Satan had stirred up strife between me and my brothers. My Lord is gracious to whom He will. He alone is all-knowing and wise.‘","12:101":"Lord, You have given me authority and taught me to interpret dreams. Creator of the heavens and the earth, my Guardian in this world and in the world to come! Allow me to die a Muslim, and admit me among the righteous.‘","12:102":"That which We have now revealed to you¹ is a tale of the unknown. You were not present when they conceived their plan, and when they schemed together","12:103":"Yet strive as you may, the greater part of mankind will not believe","12:104":"And you demand of them no recompense for this: it is but an Admonition to mankind","12:105":"Many are the marvels in the heavens and the earth; yet they pass them by and pay no heed to them","12:106":"The greater part of them believe in God only if they can worship other gods besides Him","12:107":"Are they confident they will not be overwhelmed by a scourge from God, or that the Hour will not overtake them unawares, without warning","12:108":"Say: ‘This is my path. With sure knowledge I call on you to have faith in God, I and all my followers. Glory be to God! I am no idolater.‘","12:109":"Nor were those We sent before you other than men We inspired from people of the city. Have they not travelled the land and seen what was the end of those who disbelieved before them? Surely better is the life to come for those that fear God. Can you not understand","12:110":"And when the apostles despaired and thought they were denied, Our help came down to them, delivering whom We pleased. The transgressors could not be saved from Our power","12:111":"Their annals point a moral to those that are of good sense possessed. This is no invented tale, but a confirmation of what came before it, an explanation of all things, a guide and a blessing to people who believe","13:1":"ALIF lām mīm rā‘. These are the revelations of the Book: and that which has been revealed to you from your Lord is Truth, yet most do not believe","13:2":"It was God who raised the heavens without visible pillars. He then ascended the throne and pressed the sun and the moon into service, each pursuing an appointed course. He ordains all things: He makes plain His revelations, so that you may firmly believe in meeting your Lord","13:3":"It was He who spread out the earth and placed upon it mountains and rivers. He gave all plants their male and female parts and drew the veil of night over the day. Surely in these there are signs for people who reflect","13:4":"And in the land there are adjoining plots: vineyards and cornfields and groves of palm, the single and the clustered. Their fruits are nourished by the same water: yet We make the taste of some more favoured than the taste of others. Surely in this there are signs for people who understand","13:5":"If anything could make you marvel, then you should surely marvel at those who say: ‘When we are dust, shall we be restored in a new creation?‘ Such are those who deny their Lord. Their necks shall be bound with chains. Those are the tenants of the Fire, wherein shall they abide for ever","13:6":"And they bid you hasten evil rather than good. Yet many were those who were punished before them. Your Lord is forgiving to people, despite their wrongdoing: yet stern is your Lord in retribution","13:7":"And the unbelievers say: ‘Why has no sign been sent down to him from his Lord?‘ But you are only to give warning: every nation has its mentor","13:8":"God knows what every female bears: He knows the wombs whose term falls short, and those that signify increase. For everything He has a finite measure","13:9":"He knows the unknown and the manifest: the Supreme One, the Most High","13:10":"It is the same whether you converse in secret or aloud, whether you hide under the cloak of night or walk about in the light of day","13:11":"Each has guardian angels before him and behind him, who preserve him by God‘s command. God does not change a people‘s lot unless they change what is in their hearts. If God seeks to afflict them with a misfortune, none can ward it off. Besides Him, they have no protector","13:12":"He it is who makes the lightning flash upon you, inspiring you with fear and hope, and gathers up the heavy clouds","13:13":"The thunder sounds His praises, and the angels, too, in awe of Him. He hurls His thunderbolts at whom He pleases. Yet they wrangle about God; and stern is His might","13:14":"To Him is the prayer of Truth. The idols to which they pray give them no answer. They are like a man who stretches out his hands to the water and bids it rise to his mouth: it cannot reach it. Vain are the prayers of the unbelievers","13:15":"All who dwell in the heavens and on the earth shall prostrate themselves before God: some willingly, some perforce; and their very shadows, morning and evening","13:16":"Say: ‘Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?‘ Say: ‘God.‘ Say: ‘Why then have you chosen other gods besides Him, who, even to themselves, can do neither good nor harm?‘ Say: ‘Are the blind and the seeing equal? Is darkness equal to the light?‘ Or have their idols brought into being a creation like His, so that both creations appear to them alike? Say: ‘God is the Creator of all things. He is the One who conquers all.‘","13:17":"He sends down water from the sky which fills the riverbeds to overflowing, so that the torrent bears a swelling foam, akin to that which rises from smelted ore when men make ornaments and tools. Thus God depicts Truth and falsehood. The scum is cast away, but that which is of use to man remains behind. Even thus God speaks in parables","13:18":"Rich is the recompense of those that obey their Lord. But those that disobey Him ― if they possessed all that the earth contains, and as much besides, they would gladly offer it for their ransom. Theirs shall be a baleful reckoning. Hell shall be their home, an evil resting-place","13:19":"Is then he who knows that the Truth has been revealed to you from your Lord like him who is blind? Truly, none will remember but those that are of good sense possessed","13:20":"those who keep faith with God and do not break their pledge","13:21":"who join together what God has bidden to be united; who fear their Lord and dread a baleful reckoning","13:22":"who for the sake of God endure with fortitude, attend to their prayers, and from what We gave them give in private and in public; and who ward off evil with good. These shall have the recompense of Paradise","13:23":"They shall enter the Gardens of Eden, together with the righteous among their fathers, their spouses, and their descendants. From every gate the angels will come in to them, saying","13:24":"Peace be to you for all that you have steadfastly endured; blessed is the recompense of Paradise.‘","13:25":"As for those who break God‘s covenant after confirming it, who put asunder what God has bidden to be united and perpetrate corruption in the land, the curse shall light on them; the scourge of Hell awaits them","13:26":"God gives abundantly to whom He will and sparingly likewise. They rejoice in the life of this world: yet the life of this world is but a brief diversion compared with the life to come","13:27":"The unbelievers say: ‘Why has no sign been sent down to him by his Lord?‘ Say ‘God leaves in error whom he will, and guides to Himself those who repent","13:28":"and have faith; whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of God","13:29":"Surely in the remembrance of God all hearts are comforted. Blessed are those who believe and do good works; blissful is their final abode","13:30":"Thus have We sent you forth to a community before whom other communities had passed away, that you may recite to them that with which We have inspired you. Yet they deny the Lord of Mercy. Say: ‘He is my Lord. There is no god but Him. In Him I have put my trust, and to Him I shall return.‘","13:31":"And even if there be a Koran whereby the mountains could be set in motion, the earth rent asunder, and the dead communed with, surely all things are subject to God‘s will. Are the faithful unaware that, had God pleased, He could have guided all mankind? As for the unbelievers, because of their misdeeds disaster shall not cease to afflict them or to crouch at their very doorstep until God‘s promise be fulfilled. God will not fail the appointed time","13:32":"Apostles were mocked before you: but, though I bore with the unbelievers, My scourge at length took them; and how terrible was My scourge","13:33":"Who is it that watches every soul and all its actions? Yet they set up other deities besides God. Say: ‘Name them. Would you tell Him of that which is unknown to Him on the earth? Or are they merely empty words?‘ Indeed, their foul devices seem fair to the unbelievers, for they are debarred from the right path. They have no guide, those whom God has led astray","13:34":"Torment awaits them in this nether life: but more grievous is the torment of the life to come. From God they will have no protector","13:35":"Such is the Paradise the righteous have been promised: it is watered by running brooks: eternal is its fruit, and eternal is its shade. Such shall be the end of the righteous; and the Fire shall be the fate of the unbelievers","13:36":"Those to whom We gave the Book rejoice in what is revealed to you, while some factions deny a part of it. Say: ‘I am only commanded to serve God and to associate none with Him. To Him I pray, and to Him I shall return.‘","13:37":"Thus have We revealed it, a code of judgements in the Arabic tongue. If you succumb to their desires after the knowledge you have been given, from God you shall have no guardian or protector","13:38":"We sent forth apostles before you and gave them wives and descendants. Yet no apostle could work a miracle except by God‘s leave. Every age has a term decreed","13:39":"God abrogates and confirms what He pleases. His is the Decree Eternal","13:40":"Whether We let you glimpse in some measure the scourge We promise them, or claim you back to Us, your mission is only to give warning: it is for Us to do the reckoning","13:41":"Do they not see how We invade their land and diminish its borders? If God decrees a thing, none can reverse it. And swift is His reckoning","13:42":"Those who have gone before them also schemed, but God is the master of all scheming: He knows what every soul has done. And the unbelievers will then learn for whom the blissful end is destined","13:43":"And the unbelievers say: ‘You are not sent.‘ Say: ‘Sufficient is God as my witness and your witness, and so are those who know the Book.‘","14:1":"ALIF lām rā‘. A Book We have revealed to you so that, by their Lord‘s leave, you may lead the people from darkness to the light; to the path of the Mighty, the Praiseworthy One","14:2":"the path of God, to whom belongs all that the heavens and all that the earth contain. Woe betide the unbelievers, for they shall be grievously punished","14:3":"Those who love the life of this world more than the life to come; who debar others from the path of God and seek to make it crooked: they have strayed far into error","14:4":"Each apostle We have sent has spoken only in the language of his own people, that he might clearly guide them. But God leaves in error whom He will and gives guidance to whom He pleases. He is the Almighty, the Wise One","14:5":"We sent forth Moses with Our signs: ‘Lead your people out of the darkness into the light, and remind them of God‘s bounty.‘ Surely in this there are signs for every steadfast, thankful man","14:6":"And when Moses said to his people: ‘Remember God‘s goodness to you when He delivered you from Pharaoh‘s nation, who had oppressed you cruelly, slaughtering your sons and sparing only your daughters; surely that was a grievous trial by your Lord","14:7":"For your Lord had declared: \"If you give thanks, I will bestow abundance upon you: but if you are thankless, My punishment is terrible indeed.\"‘","14:8":"And Moses said: ‘If you and all who are on earth prove thankless, God does not need your thanks, though He deserves your praise.‘","14:9":"Have you not heard what befell those that have gone before you? The people of Noah, Ad, and Thamūd, and those who came after them? God alone knows their number. Their apostles came to them with veritable signs, but they bit their hands with their mouths¹ and said: ‘We disbelieve your message. Indeed, we strongly doubt the faith to which you call us.‘","14:10":"Their apostles said: ‘Is God, Creator of the heavens and the earth, to be doubted? He calls you that He may forgive you your sins and reprieve you till an appointed time.‘ They said: ‘You are but mortals like ourselves. You wish to turn us away from the gods our fathers worshipped. Bring us some clear authority.‘","14:11":"Their apostles said to them: ‘We are indeed but mortals like yourselves; but God bestows His grace on such of His servants as He chooses. We cannot give you proof, except by God‘s leave; in God let true believers put their trust","14:12":"And why should we not trust in God, when He has already guided us on to our paths? We will endure your persecution patiently. In God let the trusting put their trust.‘","14:13":"Return to our folds,‘ the unbelievers said to their apostles, ‘or we will banish you from our land.‘ But their Lord revealed His will to them: ‘We shall surely destroy the wrongdoers","14:14":"and shall surely give you the land to dwell in after them. Let him take heed who dreads My eminence and fears My threats.‘","14:15":"And they called for help; and every hardened sinner came to grief","14:16":"Hell will stretch behind him, and putrid water shall he drink","14:17":"he will sip, but scarcely swallow. Death will assail him from every side, yet shall he not be dead. Harrowing torment awaits him","14:18":"The works of the unbelievers are like ashes which the wind scatters on a stormy day: they shall gain nothing from what they earn. That is surely the way to egregious error","14:19":"Do you not see that God created the heavens and the earth with Truth? He can remove you if He will and bring into being a new creation","14:20":"that is no difficult thing for God","14:21":"All shall appear before God. The humble will say to those who thought themselves mighty: ‘We were your followers. Can you protect us from God‘s punishment in any way?‘ They will say: ‘Had God given us guidance, we would have guided you. Neither panic nor patience will help us now. There is no escape for us.‘","14:22":"And when judgement had been passed, Satan will say to them: ‘True was the promise which God made you. I too made you a promise, but did not keep it. Yet had I no power over you. I only called you, and you answered me. Do not now blame me, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I never believed in that with which you associated me before.‘ Grievous torment awaits the wrongdoers","14:23":"And those that believe and do good works shall be admitted into Gardens watered by running brooks, wherein, by their Lord‘s leave, shall they abide for ever.

Its root is firm and its branches are in the sky","14:25":"It yields its fruit in every season by its Lord‘s leave. God speaks in parables to people so that they may reflect","14:26":"But an evil word is like a rotten tree torn out of the earth and shorn of all its roots","14:27":"God makes steadfast the faithful with His steadfast Word, both in this life and in the life to come.

Ask them, if they can speak.‘","21:64":"Thereupon they turned their thoughts upon themselves and said to each other: ‘Surely you are the ones who have done wrong.‘","21:65":"They were crestfallen: ‘You know they cannot speak.‘","21:66":"He said: ‘Would you then worship that, instead of God, which can neither help nor harm you","21:67":"Shame on you and on your idols!

Our Lord is the Merciful, whose help We seek against your blasphemies.‘","22:1":"YOU PEOPLE! Have fear of your Lord. The catastrophe of the Hour shall be terrible indeed","22:2":"The day you witness it, every suckling mother shall forsake her infant, every pregnant female shall cast her burden, and you shall see people reeling like drunkards although not drunk: but such shall be the horror of God‘s torment","22:3":"Yet there are some who in their ignorance dispute about God, and follow every rebellious demon","22:4":"doomed to seduce his follower and lead him to the scourge of the Conflagration","22:5":"You people! If you doubt the Resurrection remember that We had created you from dust, then from a living germ, then from a clot of blood,² and then from a half-formed lump of flesh, so that We might manifest to you Our power. We cause to remain in the womb whatever We please for an appointed term, and then We bring you forth as infants, that you may grow up and reach your prime. Some among you die young, and some live on to abject old age when all that they once knew they know no more. You sometimes see the earth dry and barren: but no sooner do We send the water down upon it than it begins to stir and swell, putting forth every kind of radiant bloom","22:6":"That is because God is Truth: He resurrects the dead and has power over all things","22:7":"The Hour is sure to come ― of this there is no doubt.

Keep My House clean for those who walk around it, and those who stand upright, or kneel down in worship.‘","22:27":"Exhort all people to make the pilgrimage. They will come to you on foot and on the backs of swift camels from every distant quarter","22:28":"they will come to avail themselves of many a benefit, and to pronounce on the appointed days the name of God over the cattle which He has given them for food. Eat of their flesh, and feed the poor and the unfortunate","22:29":"Then let the pilgrims tidy themselves, make their vows, and circle the Ancient House","22:30":"Such is God‘s commandment. He that reveres the sacred rites of God shall fare better in the sight of his Lord. The flesh of cattle is lawful for you, except for that which has been specified before. Guard yourselves against the abomination of idols; and avoid the utterance of falsehoods","22:31":"Dedicated to God, and serving none besides Him: he that serves other deities besides God is like him who falls from heaven and is snatched off by the birds or carried away by the wind to some far-off region","22:32":"Even such is he. He that reveres the offerings made to God shows the piety of his heart","22:33":"They are beneficial to you until a time decreed, then their place of sacrifice is by the Ancient House","22:34":"For every community We have ordained a ritual, that they may pronounce the name of God over the cattle which He has given them for food.

Give joyful tidings to the humble","22:35":"whose hearts are filled with awe at the mention of God; who endure adversity with fortitude, attend to their prayers, and give from what We gave them","22:36":"And the camels We have made a part of God‘s rites. They are of much use to you. Pronounce over them the name of God as you draw them up in line for slaughter; and when they have fallen to the ground eat of their flesh and feed the uncomplaining beggar and the demanding supplicant. Thus have We subjected them to your service, so that you may give thanks","22:37":"Their flesh and blood does not reach God; it is your piety that reaches Him. Thus has He subjected them to your service, so that you may give glory to God for guiding you. Give joyful tidings to the righteous","22:38":"God will ward off evil from true believers. God does not love the treacherous and the thankless","22:39":"Permission to take up arms is hereby given to those who are attacked, because they have been wronged. Surely God has power to grant them victory","22:40":"those who have been unjustly driven from their homes, only because they said: ‘Our Lord is God.‘ Had God not defended some by the might of others, monasteries and churches, synagogues and mosques in which His praise is daily celebrated, would have been utterly destroyed.

They lie in desolate ruin, their wells abandoned and their proud palaces empty","22:46":"Have they never journeyed through the land? Have they no hearts to reason with, or ears to hear with? It is their hearts, and not their eyes, that are blind","22:47":"They bid you hasten the scourge. And God will never fail His promise. Each day of your Lord‘s is like a thousand years in your reckoning¹","22:48":"I bore long with many cities, teeming though they were with sin; and in the end I smote them. To Me shall all return","22:49":"Say: ‘You people! I have been sent to warn you plainly","22:50":"Those that accept the true faith and do good works shall be forgiven and richly provided for","22:51":"and those that seek to confute Our revelations shall be the tenants of Hell.‘","22:52":"Never have We sent a single prophet or apostle before you with whose wishes Satan did not tamper. But God abrogates the interjections of Satan and God confirms His own revelations. God is all-knowing and wise","22:53":"He makes Satan‘s interjections a temptation for those whose hearts are tainted, whose hearts are hardened ― this is why the wrongdoers are in open schism ―","22:54":"so that those who are endowed with knowledge may realize that this² is the Truth from your Lord and thus believe in it and humble their hearts towards Him.

Omniscient is God, and gracious","22:60":"Thus shall it be. He that repays an injury in kind and then is wronged again shall be helped by God. God is merciful and forgiving","22:61":"Thus shall it be. God causes the night to pass into day, and the day to pass into night. God hears all and observes all","22:62":"Thus shall it be. God is Truth, and Falsehood all that they invoke besides Him. God alone is the Most High, the Supreme One","22:63":"Do you not see how God sends down water from the sky and forthwith the earth turns green? Gracious is God and all-knowing","22:64":"His is all that the heavens and the earth contain. Surely God is the Self-sufficient, the Praiseworthy One","22:65":"Do you not see that God has subdued for you all that is in the earth? And the ships which sail the sea at His bidding?

All is recorded in a Book. That is easy enough for God","22:71":"Yet they worship besides God that for which no sanction is revealed and of which they know nothing. The wrong-doers shall have none to help them","22:72":"And when Our revelations are recited to them in all their clarity, you will note denial in the faces of the unbelievers. Barely can they restrain themselves from assaulting those who recite Our revelations. Say: ‘Shall I tell you what is worse than that? The Fire which God has promised those who deny Him. A wretched fate.‘","22:73":"You people! Listen to this aphorism. Those whom you invoke besides God could never create a fly though they combined their forces. And if a fly stole aught from them, they could never retrieve it. Powerless is the supplicant, and powerless he whom he supplicates","22:74":"They do not render to God the homage due to Him; yet God is powerful and mighty","22:75":"God chooses emissaries from the angels and from people. Surely God hears all and observes all","22:76":"He knows what is before them and behind them. And to God shall all things be recalled","22:77":"You that are true believers, kneel down and prostrate yourselves. Worship your Lord and do good works, so that you may succeed","22:78":"Fight for the cause of God with the devotion due to Him. He has chosen you, and laid on you no burdens in the observance of your Religion, the faith of your father Abraham. In this, as in former scriptures, He has given you the name of Muslims, so that the Apostle may testify against you, and that you may yourselves testify against people. Therefore attend to your prayers, render the alms levy, and hold fast to God; for He is your guardian. A gracious guardian and a gracious helper","23:1":"SUCCESSFUL ARE the believers","23:2":"who are humble in their prayers","23:3":"who avoid profane talk","23:4":"and give alms in earnest","23:5":"who restrain their carnal desires","23:6":"except with their wives and slave-girls, for with them they are blameless","23:7":"transgressors are those who lust after other than these","23:8":"who are true to their trusts and promises","23:9":"and diligent in their prayers","23:10":"These are the heirs","23:11":"of Paradise; wherein shall they abide for ever","23:12":"We first created man from an essence of clay","23:13":"then placed him, a living germ, in a secure enclosure¹","23:14":"The germ We made a clot of blood,² and the clot a lump of flesh.

You alone can make me land in safety.\"‘","23:30":"Surely in that there were veritable signs. Thus did We put mankind to the proof","23:31":"Then We raised a new generation","23:32":"and sent forth to them an apostle of their own. ‘Serve God,‘ he said, ‘for you have no god but Him. Will you not take heed?‘","23:33":"But the unbelieving elders of his people, who denied the life to come and on whom We had lavished the good things of this life, said: ‘This man is but a mortal like yourselves, nourished by the same food and drink","23:34":"If you obey a mortal like yourselves, you shall indeed be lost","23:35":"Does he promise you, when you are dead and turned to dust and bones, you will be raised to life","23:36":"A foolish promise, indeed","23:37":"There is no other life but this, our earthly life: we die and live, never to be restored to life","23:38":"He is but a man who tells of God what is untrue. Never will We believe in him.‘","23:39":"He said: ‘Help me, Lord, for they disbelieve me.‘","23:40":"He replied: ‘Before long they shall rue it.‘","23:41":"The Cry took them in all justice, and We swept them away like withered leaves. Gone are the sinful people","23:42":"After them We raised other generations ―","23:43":"no community can delay it‘s doom or go before it ―","23:44":"and sent forth Our apostles in succession. Yet time after time each community disbelieved their apostles, so that We destroyed them one by one and held them up as an example. Gone are the people who disbelieved","23:45":"Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron, with Our signs and with clear authority","23:46":"to Pharaoh and his nobles. But they received them with contempt, for they were arrogant men","23:47":"What!‘ said they. ‘Are we to believe in two men like ourselves, whose people are our slaves?‘","23:48":"They denied them, and thus incurred destruction","23:49":"And We gave Moses the Book, that they might be rightly guided","23:50":"We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and gave them a shelter on a peaceful hill-side watered by a fresh spring","23:51":"Apostles! Eat of that which is wholesome, and do good works: I have knowledge of all your actions","23:52":"Your community is but one community, and I am your only Lord: therefore fear Me","23:53":"Yet they have divided themselves into factions, each rejoicing in its own doctrines","23:54":"Leave them in their error till a time appointed","23:55":"Do they think that, in giving them wealth and children","23:56":"We are solicitous for their welfare?

Was anything revealed to them that had not been revealed to their forefathers","23:69":"Or is it because they do not know their apostle that they deny him","23:70":"Do they say he is possessed? Surely he has come to them with the Truth. But most of them abhor the Truth","23:71":"Had the Truth followed their appetites, the heavens, the earth, and all who dwell in them, would have surely been corrupted.

Yet some among people still argue about God, without knowledge or guidance or illuminating scriptures","31:21":"And when they are told: ‘Follow what God has revealed,‘ they say: ‘We will follow the faith our fathers practised.‘ Yes, even though Satan invites them to the torment of the Conflagration","31:22":"He that submits his face to God and leads a righteous life stands on the firmest ground.¹ To God shall all return","31:23":"As for those that disbelieve, let not their disbelief grieve you.

But no sooner does He bring them safe to land than some among them falter between faith and unbelief. None denies Our revelations except the treacherous and the ungrateful","31:33":"You people! Fear your Lord, and fear the day when no parent shall avail his child nor any child his parent. God‘s promise is surely true. Let the life of this world never deceive you, nor let the Dissembler trick you about God","31:34":"God alone has knowledge of the Hour.

Send us back and we will do good works. Now we are firm believers.‘","32:13":"Had it been Our will, We could have given every soul its guidance. But My Judgement shall be fulfilled: ‘I will surely fill Hell with jinn and humans all.‘","32:14":"Taste this, for you forgot you would ever meet this day. We, too, will forget you. Taste the eternal torment, which you have earned by what you did.‘","32:15":"Indeed, none believes in Our revelations save those who, when reminded of them, prostrate themselves in adoration and give glory to their Lord in all humility","32:16":"who forsake their beds to pray to their Lord in fear and hope; who give from what We gave them","32:17":"No mortal knows what bliss will be in store for these as a reward for their labours","32:18":"Can he, then, who is a true believer, be compared to him who is an ungodly?

God is forgiving and compassionate","33:6":"The Prophet has a greater claim on the faithful than they have on each other. His wives are their mothers. God ordains that blood relations are closer to one another than to other believers or muhājirīn,¹ although you are permitted to do your friends a kindness.² That is in the Book decreed","33:7":"Tell of the covenant We made with the prophets; with you, with Noah and Abraham, with Moses and Jesus son of Mary.

Do not engage in familiar talk, for this would annoy the Prophet and he would be ashamed to bid you go; but of the truth God is not ashamed. If you ask his wives for anything, speak to them from behind a curtain. This is more chaste for your hearts and their hearts. You must not speak ill of God‘s apostle, nor shall you ever wed his wives after him; this would surely be a grave offence in the sight of God","33:54":"Whether you reveal a thing or conceal it, God has knowledge of all things","33:55":"It shall be no offence for the Prophet‘s wives to be seen unveiled by their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers‘ sons, their sisters‘ sons, their women, or their slave-girls.

He is the Compassionate, the Forgiving One","34:3":"The unbelievers say: ‘The Hour will never come upon us.‘ Say: ‘Yes, by the Lord, it is surely coming! He knows all that is hidden. Not an atom‘s weight in the heavens or the earth escapes Him; nor is there anything smaller or greater but is recorded in a veritable book","34:4":"He will surely recompense those who have faith and do good works; they shall be forgiven and a rich provision shall be made for them","34:5":"But those who strive to confute Our revelations shall suffer the torment of a harrowing scourge.‘","34:6":"Those endowed with knowledge can see that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the Truth, leading to the path of the Almighty, the Praised One","34:7":"The unbelievers say: ‘Shall we show you a man¹ who would have you know that when you have been torn into shreds you will be raised in a new creation","34:8":"Has he invented a falsehood about God, or is he a man possessed?‘ Truly, those who deny the life to come are doomed to torment, and they have strayed far into error","34:9":"Do they not see what is before them and behind them in heaven and earth? If We will, We can cause the earth to cave in beneath their feet or let fragments of the sky fall upon them.

We said: ‘Mountains, and you birds, echo his songs of praise.‘ We made iron pliant to him, saying","34:11":"Make coats of mail and measure their links with care. Do what is right: I am watching all your actions.‘","34:12":"And to Solomon We subjected the wind, travelling a month‘s journey on a morning and a month‘s journey on an evening.

We said: ‘Give thanks, House of David.‘ Yet few of My servants are truly thankful","34:14":"And when We had decreed his death, they did not know that he was dead until they saw a worm eating away his staff. And when his corpse fell down, the jinn realized that had they had knowledge of the unknown, they would not have remained in shameful torment","34:15":"For the natives of Sheba there was indeed a sign in their dwelling-place: a garden on their right and a garden on their left. We said to them: ‘Eat of what your Lord has given you and render thanks to Him. Pleasant is your land and forgiving is your Lord.‘","34:16":"But they paid no heed.

Woe betide those who serve other gods besides Him","41:7":"who give no alms and disbelieve in the life to come","41:8":"As for those who have faith and do good works, an endless recompense awaits them.‘","41:9":"Say: ‘Do you indeed disbelieve in Him who created the earth in two days? And do you make other gods His equals? The Lord of the Universe is He.‘","41:10":"He set therein mountains towering high above it; He pronounced His blessing upon it, and in four days provided it with sustenance for all alike","41:11":"Then, turning to the sky, which was but a cloud of vapour, He said to it and to the earth: ‘Come forward both, willingly or perforce.‘","41:12":"And they both said: ‘Come we will, obediently.‘ He decreed them to be seven heavens in two days, and to each heaven He assigned its task. We decked the lowest heaven with lamps and guarded them.

We will never believe in your message.\"‘","41:15":"And as for ‘Ād, they conducted themselves with arrogance in the land, without justice. ‘Who is mightier than we?‘ they used to say. Could they not see that God, who had created them, was mightier than they? Yet they denied Our revelations","41:16":"So, over a few ill-omened days We let loose on them a howling gale, to make them taste the scourge of shame in this nether life; but more shameful still will be the scourge of the life to come. There shall be none to succour them","41:17":"And as for Thamūd, We offered them Our guidance, but they preferred blindness to guidance. Therefore the thunderbolt of a humiliating scourge struck them for their misdeeds","41:18":"and We delivered those who believed and those who feared God","41:19":"Forewarn them of the day when God‘s enemies will be herded into the Fire","41:20":"so that when they are sorted out, their ears, their eyes, and their very skins will testify to what they did","41:21":"And to their skins they will say: ‘Why did you testify against us?‘ and their skins will say: ‘God, who gives speech to all things, has made us speak.

Well have they deserved the fate of bygone nations of jinn and humans. They shall assuredly be lost","41:26":"The unbelievers say: ‘Do not listen to this Koran. Cut short its recital with frivolous chatter, so that you may gain the upper hand.‘","41:27":"We will surely make the unbelievers taste grievous torment, and pay them back for the worst of their misdeeds","41:28":"Thus shall God‘s enemies be recompensed. The Fire shall for ever be their home, because they have denied Our revelations","41:29":"And the unbelievers will say: ‘Lord, show us those among the jinn and humans who made us go astray. We will trample them under our feet and make them the lowest of the low.‘","41:30":"As for those who say: ‘Our Lord is God,‘ and then follow the straight path, the angels will descend upon them, saying: ‘Fear not, and do not grieve. Rejoice in the Paradise you have been promised","41:31":"We are your guardians in this world and in the world to come.

He it is who hears all and knows all","41:37":"Among His signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon.

He that gives it life will surely raise the dead to life. He has power over all things","41:40":"Those that deny Our revelations are not hidden from Our view.

And but for a word from your Lord, long since decreed, judgement would have been passed among them; grave is their doubt about it","41:46":"He that does good does it for his own soul; and he that commits evil does so at his own peril. Never is your Lord unjust to mortals","41:47":"He alone has knowledge of the Hour. No fruit comes out of their pods, no female conceives or is delivered, but with His knowledge. On the day He will call out to them: ‘Where are those fellow-gods of Mine?‘ ‘We confess,‘ they will say, ‘that none of us can vouch for them.‘","41:48":"The idols to which they prayed before will vanish from them, and they shall learn there is no escape","41:49":"Man never wearies of praying for good things. But when evil befalls him he loses hope and grows despondent","41:50":"And if after affliction We vouchsafe him a favour from Ourself, he is sure to say: ‘This is my own. I do not think the Hour will ever come. And even if I do return to my Lord, He will surely reward me well.‘ We shall tell the unbelievers what they did, and We will surely visit upon them a grievous scourge","41:51":"When We show favour to man, he turns his back and holds aloof; but when evil befalls him he is loud in prayer","41:52":"Say: ‘Do but consider: if this Koran is indeed from God and you deny it, who can err more than he who openly defies Him?‘","41:53":"We will show them Our signs across the horizons and in their own souls, until they clearly see that it is the Truth. Does it not suffice that your Lord is the witness of all things","41:54":"Yet they still doubt that they will ever meet their Lord. Yet surely He encompasses all things","42:1":"ῌā‘ mīm","42:2":"ain sīn qāf","42:3":"Thus God, the Mighty One, the Wise One, inspires you as He inspired those before you","42:4":"His is what the heavens and the earth contain. And He is the Most High, the Almighty, the Supreme One","42:5":"The heavens above well-nigh split asunder as the angels give glory to their Lord and beg forgiveness for those on earth. Surely God is the Forgiving One, the Compassionate","42:6":"As for those that serve other masters besides Him, God Himself is watching them; you are not their keeper","42:7":"Thus have We revealed to you an Arabic Koran, that you may warn the mother-city¹ and those who dwell around it; that you may forewarn them of the day that shall indubitably come: when all are brought together, some in Paradise and some in the Conflagration","42:8":"Had it been God‘s will, He could have united them into one community. But God admits whom He will into His mercy; the wrongdoers have none to befriend or succour them","42:9":"Or have they set up other guardians besides Him? But surely it is God who is the Guardian. He resurrects the dead, and He has power over all things","42:10":"Whatever the subject of your disputes, the final word belongs to God. Such is God, my Lord: in Him I have put my trust, and to Him I turn in penitence","42:11":"Creator of the heavens and the earth, He has given you spouses from among yourselves, and cattle male and female; it is thus that He multiplies you. Nothing can be compared with Him. He alone hears all and sees all","42:12":"His are the keys of the heavens and the earth. He gives abundantly to whom He will and sparingly also. He has knowledge of all things","42:13":"He has ordained for you such religion as He enjoined on Noah, which We have now revealed to you; which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: ‘Observe the Religion and do not divide.‘ Hard for the pagans is that to which you call them. God chooses for it whom He will, and guides to it those that repent","42:14":"Yet they did not divide themselves, through their own wickedness, until knowledge was given them. And but for a word that had already gone forth from your Lord reprieving them for an appointed term, judgement would have surely been passed among them. And those who inherited the Scriptures after them have their grave doubts too","42:15":"Therefore preach and keep to the straight path as you are commanded. Do not be led by their desires, but say: ‘I believe in all the Scriptures that God has revealed. I am commanded to exercise justice among you. God is our Lord and your Lord.

He is the Invincible One, the Almighty","42:20":"Whoever seeks the harvest of the world to come, to him We will give in great abundance; and whoever desires the harvest of this world, a share of it shall We give him: but in the world to come he shall have no share at all","42:21":"Have they idols which in the practice of their faith have made lawful to them what God has not allowed? Had the Decisive Word not been pronounced already, judgement would have been passed among them. Woeful punishment awaits the wrongdoers","42:22":"You shall behold the wrongdoers aghast at what they earned, which will surely smite them. But those that have faith and do good works shall dwell in the fair Gardens of Paradise, and shall receive in their Lord‘s presence all that they desire. That will be the supreme grace","42:23":"Such is God‘s joyful promise to His servants who believe and do good works. Say: ‘For this I ask of you no recompense, except to love your kin. He that does a good deed We shall repay many times over. Surely God is forgiving and bountiful in His rewards.‘","42:24":"Or do they say: ‘He has framed a falsehood about God?‘ But if God pleased, He could set a seal upon your heart. God will bring falsehood to nothing and vindicate the Truth by His Words. He surely knows ones innermost thoughts","42:25":"He it is who accepts His servants‘ repentance, and pardons their sins. He has knowledge of what you do","42:26":"And He answers those who believe and do good works, and enriches them through His bounty. But grievous punishment awaits the unbelievers","42:27":"Had God bestowed abundance upon His servants, they would have committed much injustice in the land. But He gives what He will in due measure; He well knows and observes His servants","42:28":"He it is who sends down the rain when they have lost all hope, and spreads abroad His mercy. He is the Guardian worthy of praise","42:29":"Among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the living things He has dispersed over them. If He will, He can gather them all together","42:30":"Whatever misfortune befalls you, it is the fruit of your own labours. He forgives much","42:31":"And on the earth you cannot escape, nor have you any besides God to protect or help you","42:32":"And among His signs are the ships which sail like mountains upon the ocean","42:33":"If He will, He calms the wind, so that they lie motionless upon its bosom:¹ surely there are signs in this for steadfast who render thanks","42:34":"or He causes them to founder as punishment for their misdeeds.² Yet He forgives much","42:35":"Those who dispute Our revelations shall realize they have no escape","42:36":"That which you have been given is but the fleeting pleasure of this life. Better and more enduring is God‘s recompense to those who believe and put their trust in their Lord","42:37":"who eschew grievous sins and lewd acts and, when angered, are willing to forgive","42:38":"who obey their Lord, attend to their prayers, and conduct their affairs by mutual counsel; who give in alms from what We gave them and","42:39":"when oppressed, seek to redress their wrongs","42:40":"Let evil be requited with like evil.

And you shall see the wrongdoers when they behold the scourge, say: ‘Is there no way back?‘","42:45":"And you shall see them ranged before it: awed and humiliated, they shall look with furtive glances. And the true believers will say: ‘The lost are those who lost their souls and all their kin on the Day of Resurrection.‘ The wrongdoers shall surely suffer everlasting torment","42:46":"they shall have no friends besides God to help them. He whom God confounds shall be lost indeed","42:47":"Obey your Lord before a day arrives which none can put off against the will of God.

When We give man a taste of Our mercy, he rejoices in it; but when evil befalls him because of what his hands committed, man is ungrateful","42:49":"God‘s is the sovereignty over the heavens and the earth. He creates what He will; He gives daughters to whom He will and sons to whom He pleases","42:50":"Or He gives both sons and daughters, and He makes sterile whom He will. Omniscient is God, and Almighty","42:51":"It is not vouchsafed to any mortal that God should speak to him except by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or through a messenger sent and authorized by Him to make known His will.
