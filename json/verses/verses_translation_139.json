Then we will do (good) deeds other than our evil actions.\" In fact, they will have lost their souls, and the things they invented will leave them in the lurch (and without help)","7:54":"Indeed, your Guardian-Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and then He rose over on the Throne (of authority): He draws the night as a veil over the day, each (day and night) searching the other in rapid sequence: And He created the sun, the moon, and the stars, (all) governed by laws of His (divine) Order. Surely, is it not His to create and to govern? Blessed is Allah, the Lord (and the Cherisher) of all the Worlds (Rab-Al-'Ala'meen)","7:55":"Call on your Lord (in prayer) while being humble and in private: Because Allah does not love those who exceed (their) bounds","7:56":"And do not do mischief in the land, after it has been put in order, but call to Him with fear and (longing) in hope (for Him): Because the Mercy of Allah is close to those who do good","7:57":"It is He Who sends the winds like giver of happy news, coming (to you) before His Mercy (the rains): When they have carried the heavily loaded clouds (with water), We drive them to a land that is dead, make rain to fall on it; Then We produce every kind of crop with it: Like this We shall raise up the dead: In case you may remember or take the warning","7:58":"From the land that is clean and good, (and) by the Will of its Cherisher, comes up a crop (rich) after its kind: But from the land that is bad, comes up nothing except that which is meager: Thus We explain the Signs in many (ways) to those who are grateful","7:59":"Indeed, We sent Nuh (Noah) to his people, he said: \"O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other god except Him. Truly, I fear for you the punishment of an awful Day","7:60":"The leaders of his people said: \"Verily, We see you clearly in error","7:61":"He said: \"O my people!

And I know from Allah something that you do not know","7:63":"Do you wonder that a message from your Lord has come to you, through a man of your own people, to warn you— So that you may fear Allah and by chance receive His Mercy","7:64":"But they rejected him (Nuh) and We delivered him, and those with him, in the Ark: But We overcame (and drowned) in the Flood those (of his people) who rejected Our Signs (verses). They were truly a blind people","7:65":"To the ‘Ad people, (We sent) Hud, one of their (own) brothers: He said: \"O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other god but Him. Will you not fear (Allah)","7:66":"The leaders of disbelievers from his people said: \"Verily, we see you are a fool, and verily, we think you are among the liars","7:67":"He said: \"O my people! I am not a fool, but (I am) a messenger from the Lord (and Cherisher) of the Worlds","7:68":"I (only) convey unto you the Message of my Lord: To you, I am a sincere and trustworthy advisor","7:69":"Do you wonder that a message from your Lord has come to you, through a man of your own people, to warn you— And remember that He made you successors after the people of Nuh (Noah), and gave you a position high among the nations. So remember the benefits (to you) from Allah: So that you may prosper","7:70":"They said: \"Do you come to us (saying), that we may worship Allah alone, and give up the way (for worship) of our fathers? So bring us what you threaten us with, if you are (really) telling the truth","7:71":"He said: \"Punishment and anger have already come to you from your Lord: Do you (still) argue with me over names which you have made up—, you and your fathers— Without authority from Allah? Then wait, I am with you among those who are waiting","7:72":"We saved him and those who stayed close to him, by Our Mercy, and We cut off the roots of those who rejected Our Signs and did not believe","7:73":"To the Samood (Thamud people, We sent) Salih, one of their own brothers: He said: \"O my people! Worship Allah; You have no other god but Him. Now a clear (Sign) has come to you from your Lord! This female camel (she-camel) of Allah is a Sign to you: So let her graze in Allah’s earth, and do not harm her, or you shall be caught up in a painful punishment","7:74":"And remember how He made you to take after the ‘Ad people, and gave you places to live in the land: You built for yourselves palaces and castles in (open) plains, and carve out homes in the mountains; So remember the benefits (to you) from Allah, and keep away from evil and mischief on the earth","7:75":"The leaders of the proud ones from among his people said to those who were known to be powerless— Those among them who believed: \"Do you know that Salih is truly a messenger from his Lord?\" They said: \"We do indeed believe in the Revelation which has been sent through him","7:76":"The proud ones said: \"As our part, we reject what you believe in","7:77":"Then they crippled (by cutting the hamstrings of) the she-camel, and proudly opposed the order of their Lord, saying: \"O Salih! Bring on your threats, if you are truly a messenger (of Allah)","7:78":"So the earthquake overtook them while they were not aware, and they lay on their face down in their homes in the morning","7:79":"He (Salih) left them, saying: \"O my people! I did truly bring to you the Message for which I was sent by my Lord: I gave you good advice, but you did not love good advisors","7:80":"We also (sent) Lut (Lot): He said to his people: \"Do you practice indecent acts that no people in creation (ever) did before you","7:81":"Because you practice your (sexual) desires on men in preference to women: You are truly a people going beyond bounds","7:82":"And his people did not answer except this: They said: \"Drive them out of your city: These are men who want to be clean and pure from sins","7:83":"But We saved him and his family, except his wife: She was of those who lagged behind","7:84":"And We rained on them a shower (of brimstone): See then, what was the end of those who practiced sin and crime","7:85":"To the Madyan people, We sent Shu’aib, one of their own brothers: He said: \"O my people! Worship Allah; You have no other god except Him. Surely, a clear (Sign) has come to you from your Lord! Give just (and proper) measure and weight, and do not keep away from the people the things that are their due; And do not do mischief in the land after it has been put in order: That will be best for you, if you have Faith","7:86":"And do not sit on every road, saying threats, blocking from the Path of Allah those who believe in Him and searching for something crooked in it; Remember how you were a few and He gave you increase.

I really brought the Message to you for which I was sent by my Lord: I gave you good advice, but how shall I feel sad for people who refuse to believe","7:94":"And whenever We sent a prophet to a town (and they rejected him,) We helped its people in suffering and misfortune, so that they might learn humility","7:95":"Then We changed their suffering into success and joy, until they grew and multiplied, and began to say: \"Our fathers (too) had suffering and success\"— Look! We called them to account all of a sudden, when they were not aware (of the situation)","7:96":"And if the people of the towns had only believed and feared Allah, certainly We should indeed have opened out to them blessings from heavens and earth; But they rejected (the truth), and We brought them to account for their wrong doings","7:97":"Did the people of the towns feel safe against the coming of Our anger (on them) during the night while they slept","7:98":"Or else did they feel safe against the coming of Our Punishment, in open (broad) daylight while they played about","7:99":"Did they then feel safe against the Plan of Allah? But no one can feel safe from the Plan of Allah, except those (falling) into (his own) ruin","7:100":"To those (people) who take over the earth after its (previous) owners, is it not a guiding (lesson) that, if We so wanted, We could (also) punish them for their sins, and close their hearts so that they could not hear","7:101":"Such were the towns whose story We bring to you (like this): Truly, there came to them their messengers with clear (Signs): But they would not believe what they had rejected before, thus does Allah close the hearts of those who reject Faith","7:102":"We did not find most of them, those men (true) to their promise: But We found most of them rebellious and disobedient","7:103":"Then after them We sent Musa (Moses) with Our Signs to Firon (Pharaoh) and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them: So (then) see what was the end of those who caused mischief","7:104":"Musa (Moses) said: \"O Firon (Pharaoh)! I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds (Rab-Al-'Ala'meen)—","7:105":"One for whom, it is right to say nothing but the truth about Allah!

That will truly be the greatest reward (from Allah)","42:23":"That is (the reward) about which Allah gives glad tidings (and good news) to His servants who believe and do righteous good deeds. Say: \"No reward do I ask of you for this except to be kind to me in the love and kinship.\" And if anyone earns any good and righteous deeds, We shall give him an increase in the good (that he has earned in proper measure): Verily, Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Appreciative (Ash-Shukoor, of the service from His servants)","42:24":"Or, do they say: \"He has made up lies against Allah?\" If Allah so willed, He could close up your heart.
