Say: “Do you know better or Allah? And who is more unjust than one who has concealed the evidence (received) from Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.”","2:141":"That was the Ummah which has passed away. For it is what it earned and for you, what you earned. And you will not be asked of what they used to do","2:142":"Soon the fools among the people would say: “What had made them revert from their Qiblah which they were attached to.” Say: “To Allah belong the East and the West. He guides whom He thinks proper to Sirat-al-Mustaqim","2:143":"And thus We evolved you as an ideal Ummah so that you become witnesses over mankind and the Messenger becomes a witness over you. And We did not prescribe the Qiblah which you patronise except that We might know who copies the Messenger, from that who turns away upon his two heels. And certainly it is extremely hard except for those whom Allah has guided. And Allah would never be one who may make your faith of no effect. Verily Allah is Full of Kindness, continuously Merciful to mankind","2:144":"Certainly, We take notice of the turning of your face in heaven. So, without doubt, We shall appoint you the governor of the Qiblah and this shall please you.

And certainly the people who were given Al-Kitab fully know that it is Al-Haqq from their Nourisher-Sustainer. And Allah is not unaware of what they practice","2:145":"And even if you came to the people who were given Al-Kitab with a proof of every sort, they did not adopt your Qiblah. And you are not the follower of their Qiblah; and some of them are not the followers of the Qiblah of some others (among them). And verily, if you followed their vain desires, after what has come to you from Al-Ilm, then indeed you are from the transgressors","2:146":"Those whom We gave Al-Kitab, recognise it as they recognise their sons. And certainly a group among them clearly conceal the truth while they know","2:147":"Al-Haqq from your Nourisher-Sustainer, so be not of those who doubt","2:148":"And to every one (is a) ‘site of attention,’ he being one who turns to it.

And wheresoever you are, do turn your faces (towards) its nucleus so that there be no ground with the people against you except those of them who committed transgression. So pay no allegiance to them and pay allegiance to Me; and that I may complete My grace on you and perchance you may be guided","2:151":"Similarly We have sent among you a Messenger of your own. He recites to you Our Ayaat and sanctifies you and teaches you Al-Kitab and Al-Hikmah and gives you knowledge which you were not knowing","2:152":"Then be mindful of Me, I will be attentive to you; and be grateful to Me and do not blaspheme Me","2:153":"O you people who have Believed! Invoke assistance with patience and Salat. Indeed Allah is with those who patiently persevere","2:154":"And say not to that who is killed in the Cause of Allah: “(they are) dead ones.” Nay! They are living; although you do not perceive","2:155":"And certainly, We shall test you with a little of fear and hunger and loss in wealth, lives and fruits (of your orchards, till and labour).

We are because of Allah and certainly we are returnees to Him.”","2:157":"Those people: (descend) on them greetings from their Nourisher-Sustainer and (also) mercy. And they are the ones who receive guidance","2:158":"Verily, As-safa and Al-Marwah (are) among the symbols of Allah. So one who has attended the Hajj at The House or has performed Umra — there is no blame on him if he made rounds in between these two. And that who voluntarily did a desirable act, then verily, Allah is All-Recogniser, All-Aware","2:159":"Verily, those who conceal what We have sent down from the clear signs and guidance after what We explained for mankind in Al-Kitab — such are the people Allah curses them and curse them those entitled to curse —","2:160":"except those who made amends and reformed and openly propagated (the statements of Al-Kitab).

Bestower of unlimited mercy, Continuously Merciful","2:164":"Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of the night and the day, and in the ship which sails in the sea through which mankind benefits, and what Allah sent down from the direction of the sky as water, and then He gave life to the earth after its death, and He scattered therein all sorts of moving creatures, and the rapid movements of the winds, and the clouds hanging between the sky and the earth — indeed (there are) signs for the people who use intellect","2:165":"And of mankind is that who picks up rivals besides Allah. They feel attachment to them, the attachment which suits Allah (alone). And those who have Believed are overflowing in their love for Allah.

Certainly he is to you an evident enemy","2:169":"It is so, that (Satan) commands you sin and obscenity and that you should utter about Allah what you do not know","2:170":"And when it is said to them: “Adopt what Allah has sent down.” They said: “Nay! We shall adopt on what we found our fathers.” What, even if their fathers were not understanding anything and were not getting guidance","2:171":"The example of those who disbelieved is like the example of that who calls the one who does not listen (to the contents of the Message) but as a call and a sound: deaf, dumb and blind, so they will not understand","2:172":"O you who have Believed! Eat of the palatable things what We have provided to you and be grateful to Allah if it is Him you pay obedience","2:173":"He has only forbidden you ‘the dead’, and the blood, and the flesh of swine and what has been pronounced, along with Him, for other than Allah.

Certainly Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Continuously Merciful","2:174":"Verily, those who hide what Allah has delivered in Al-Kitab and thus they earn a little sum, they swallow in their bellies nothing but Fire; and Allah will not talk to them on the Day of Resurrection, and will not sanctify them. And for them is a penalty grievous","2:175":"They are the people who have purchased ignorance in place of guidance, and punishment in place of forgiveness. Ah! What has made them bold against the Fire","2:176":"This is because indeed Allah delivered Al-Kitab in original, and certainly those who created difference of opinion in Al-Kitab, are definitely broken in splinters, remote (from the Message)","2:177":"It is not righteousness that you turn your faces to the East and the West (as Qiblah); but righteousness is this: one who has Believed in Allah and the Last Day, and the angels and Al-Kitab and the Prophets; and he gave his wealth out of His love to close relations, and members of the weaker class and the needy and who has become unpossessed while in travel, and those who are compelled to put up a request; and for giving freedom to one who is in bondage, and he established Salat and he paid off Zakat; and who fulfill their promises and contracts when they have ratified (any); and the patient and perseverent in states of pain and suffering and throughout states of panic — such are the people who have proved (their Belief in Allah) and these are the ones who are Al-Muttaqun","2:178":"O you who have Believed! Al-Qisas is prescribed to you in murders. (Kill) the free when the killer happens to be the free, and the bondman when he is a bondman, and the woman when (the killer) is the woman. But who has forgiven something on his (victim’s) behalf to his brother (i.e., to the killer), then fulfil (it) in a desirable way and compensate him with gratitude. This is a concession and mercy from your Nourisher-Sustainer.

They are a garment to you and you are a garment to them. Allah knew that you: you continued to curtail from the rights of yourselves, so He turned in attention to you and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek (the pleasure or progeny) whatever Allah has written for you. And continue to eat and drink until becomes evident to you the white linear area from the dark linear area (on the sky) at the break of dawn. Then complete the fasts till it is night (and the sun is no more visible). And do not have sexual relations with them while you are in Itikaf in the mosques.

And bear witness that we are Muslims.”","5:112":"When Al-Hawariyyun said: “O Iesa, son of Maryam! Has your Nourisher-Sustainer the capacity that He may lower down on us a table set with food (descending) from the heaven?” (Iesa) said: “Pay obedience to Allah if you are Believers.”","5:113":"They said: “We intend that we eat thereof and our hearts may find solace (therewith) and we may know that surely you spoke the truth to us and we may (thus) become, over it, (as) witnesses.”","5:114":"Iesa, son of Maryam said: “Beloved Allah, Our Nourisher-Sustainer!

Then whoever disbelieves afterwards, out of you, then definitely I will inflict him a punishment (such as) I have not inflicted that on anyone out of the worlds","5:116":"And when Allah said: o Iesa, son of Maryam! Are you (the one) you said to mankind: “Pick up me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?” He said: “Glory be to You! It does not suit me that I utter what is not to me as permissible. If I happened to be that I said it, then surely You have known it, You know what is in my inner-self and I know not what is in Your’s Self.

Those who have damaged their selves: so they will not Believe","6:21":"And who is more wrong-doer than one who invented against Allah (evident) falsehood or belied His Ayaat? Certainly it is that the transgressors do not attain success","6:22":"And the Day We shall gather them all together; afterwards We shall say to those who joined partners (in worship with Us): “Where are partners assigned by you — those whom you used to assert (as partners in the dominion of Allah)?”","6:23":"Thereafter there remains no excuse (or argument) from them except that they said: “By Allah, Our Nourisher-Sustainer, we were not polytheists.”","6:24":"Look! How they lied against themselves; and disappeared from them what they had been falsely inventing","6:25":"And out of them is that who listens to you; and We have set over their hearts a covering that they may understand it (naught) and in their ears, a cork.

And they destroy not but their ownselves, yet they perceive (it) not","6:27":"And if you saw when they were set over the Fire, then they said: “Would that be for us that we are sent back to the earth and we do not deny the Ayaat of our Nourisher-Sustainer and we become out of the Believers?”","6:28":"Nay! (Now) has become manifest to them what they had been hiding since before.

Then We involved them in poverty and disease so that they may (submit to Al-Kitab and) show humility","6:43":"Then why they did not show humility when Our inflictment came to them? Rather their hearts became hardened, and the Satan made fair-seeming to them that which they had been doing","6:44":"So when they forgot (Al-Kitab) with which they had been admonished and reminded, We opened to them the gates of all things (from Our Providence) until when they enjoyed fully what they were given, We, out of a sudden, seized them (in punishment), so at that time they are those who are devoid of hope","6:45":"So was cut off the root of the nation of those who transgressed.

And if she (i.e., the nafs) presents ransom — all kinds of ransom, it shall not be accepted from her. They are those who are caught in destruction because of what they earned.

Definitely the earth belongs to Allah. He allots it in inheritance whom He thinks proper among His Ibad. And the final end (goes) in favour of the righteous ones","7:129":"They said: “We were put to sufferings before you came to us and (even) afterwards as you came to us.” (Musa) said: “It is expected of your Nourisher-Sustainer that He destroys your enemy and make you settling successors on earth (and) then watch how you act upon.”","7:130":"And indeed, We involved the followers of Fir’aun with years (of drought) and decreased flow of fruits so that they might be reminded (towards the Book of Allah) and they might remind others (to it)","7:131":"Then as came to them the relief (from this period of test) they said: “(The credit) of this goes to us and if an evil afflicts them they regard (it) as an evil-effect associated with Musa and those with him.

Invoke, for our sake, your Nourisher-Sustainer with what He has promised through you. Indeed if you removed from us Ar-Rijz, surely we shall believe for your sake and surely we shall send Bani Israiel with you (as free people).”","7:135":"So whenever We removed from them Ar-Rijz for a fixed term (to allow them to arrange and complete the migration of the Muslim-community, and as) they reached it (i.e., they approached the end of the respite-period), immediately they break (the commitment, and extend the enslavement period for the Believers)","7:136":"So We took retribution from them. Then We drowned them in the sea because they belied Our Ayaat and they remained unaware of them","7:137":"And We made inheritors — the nation of those who had been made weak in persecution — of the easts of the land and its wests which We had blessed therein. And the fair word of your Nourisher-Sustainer got fulfilled over Bani Israiel because they showed endurance and perseverance. And We completely destroyed what Firaun and his nation were inventing (in their space technology) and what they were directing upwards (in space)","7:138":"And We made Bani Israiel to cross over the sea, so they intermingled with a nation who are staying over the idols (they had carved) for themselves. They said: “O Musa! Appoint to us an ilah (a god) as to them are (their) aaliha (gods)!” (Musa) said: “Verily, you are a nation who indulge in ignorance","7:139":"Surely these people: stands destroyed, which they are involved in, and (it is all) false what they had been doing.”","7:140":"(Musa further) said: “Shall I seek for you an ilah other than Allah while He made you superior over the worlds (as Muslims)?”","7:141":"And (bring to mind) when We rescued you from the followers of Fir’aun; they (used to) give you torture in punishment — they are killing your sons and letting your women survive, and in this (is) an extreme test from your Nourisher-Sustainer","7:142":"And We promised Musa ‘thirty nights’ and We completed this term with ten (additional sessions). So he (i.e., Musa) completed the sitting (arranged by) his Nourisher-Sustainer (appearing as) forty nights.

Be apparent to me, I will look upon you.” Allah said: “Never shall you see Me (as your abilities as a human creation stand limited) but (continue to) look towards the mountain, then if it stood stationary and entire at its place, then soon you shall see Me.” So when his Nourisher-Sustainer manifested in Light for the mount, He made it collapsed to dust, and Musa fell down unconscious. Then when he revived (in his senses and became fully conscious) he said: “Glory to You, I have turned to You in repentance and I am the First of the Believers.”","7:144":"He said: “O Musa! I have chosen you over mankind through My Messages and through My Statement. So pick-up what I have given you and be among the grateful.”","7:145":"And We wrote for him on Al-Alwah out of all things as Mauizah and Tafseelan-lekulle-sha’in. So (We directed Musa thus): “Hold unto these with firmness and enjoin your nation that they should adopt the better of it. Very soon We show you the home of Al-Fasiqun","7:146":"Soon I shall turn away from My Ayaat those who behave in arrogance on the earth without (any) right and if they noticed each and every Ayat they will not believe in them. And if they noticed the path to righteousness they will not adopt it as the Way. And if they noticed the path of rebellion they will adopt it as the way. This is because they have belied Our Ayaat and they remained unaware of them","7:147":"And those who belied Our Ayaat and the Meeting in the Hereafter, their actions have become of no effect. Would they be rewarded (any thing) other than what they had been doing (in their actions, concepts and thinhead of states)","7:148":"And the nation of Musa carved, in his absence, out of their ornaments, the body-form of a calf (mechanising) to it a mooing sound. Did they not see that it does not speak to them and does not guide them the way? They picked it (as a god in cow-worship) and they became transgressors","7:149":"And when it was dismantled (by Musa and they received the pieces) in their hands and they realised that they have definitely gone astray, (in repentance) they said: “Surely, if our Nourisher-Sustainer does not shower Mercy on us and forgives us, out of a surety, we become out of the losers.”","7:150":"And when returned Musa to his nation, angry and grieved, he said: “Evil it is what you people did in my absence, after me. Did you people make haste regarding the order of your Nourisher-Sustainer (who advised me a stay of many nights away from you)? And he put down Al-Alwah (with full respect) and he seized his brother (Harun) by the head (and) he drags him towards himself. (Facing this, Harun) said: “Son of my mother! Indeed the nation regarded me weak and they went to the stage (that) they will kill me. So do not make the enemies make a fun of me and don’t regard me as being with the nation of transgressors.”","7:151":"(Musa) said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Grant Forgiveness to me and my brother and make us (both) enter into Your Mercy, and You are more Merciful of those who grant mercy.”","7:152":"Certainly those who took the calf (in cow-worship): soon, will reach them wrath from their Nourisher-Sustainer and humiliation in the life of this world. And thus We reward those who invent lies (in the name of religion)","7:153":"And those who committed evil deeds and then took a turn in repentance and accepted Faith, verily, your Nourisher-Sustainer, after (all) this (is) surely Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful","7:154":"And when the anger from Musa subsided he (again) picked up Al-Alwah and in their inscription (is given) guidance and mercy for those: they, for their Nourisher-Sustainer feel fear and regard","7:155":"And Musa picked up his nation (in the form of) seventy (representative) male-adults for Our appointed time and place for meeting, but when a violent tremor seized them, (Musa) said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer!

If I were, (that) I know the ghaib (unseen), I must have secured (for myself) abundance in providence, and no evil could have touched me. I am not but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings for a nation who develop Faith.”","7:189":"[Note that the word Nafs means life or self. It is always referred in female gender. The word Zauj means a partner, a mate, a kind or a consort. It could be referred to as male in gender or as female. The word Zaujah is female in word-form and is regarded female in gender.] He it is Who created you from a single Nafs and He evolved out of this a Zauj to this, so that he finds pleasure and tranquility in her. So when he covered her (in sexual approach, as husband and wife), she conceived a very light pregnancy. So she continued moving with this (pregnancy). So when she became heavy, the twain invoked Allah — the Nourisher-Sustainer to these two: “Surely if You bestow us a salih (a righteous one), surely we shall be out of the grateful.”","7:190":"But when He bestowed on those two a salih, the two (members out of a certain couple) ascribed to Him partners in that which He gave those two.

And those who accumulate treasures of gold and silver and do not spend them in the Cause of Allah: so announce to them the tidings of a painful torment","9:35":"The Day this (treasure of gold and silver) is heated upon in the Fire of Hell, then are branded therewith their foreheads, and their flanks, and their backs (and it will be said to them): “This is what you collected as a treasure for yourselves. So taste what you have been collecting as a treasure.”","9:36":"Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in one year) in Kitabullah (since) the Day He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are sacred and protected (i.e., the last four months of every lunar year. See Verse number 28 of this Surah, and also Verses 1st to 5th). This is the Established Religion (and it creates an atmosphere of peace and tranquility throughout the world during the month of Fasting and the three-months’ season of Hajj). So wrong not therein your ownselves (by initiating armed encounters). And do indulge in Qital with Mushrikun collectively as they make Qital with you collectively (if and when they pay no regard to the ‘protected’ status of the closing four months). And be aware that Allah is with those who are righteous","9:37":"Certainly it is, that Nasi [interchanging or replacement (of a protected month by one which is not protected)] amounts to going deeper in disbelief; thereby the disbelievers are led astray. They make it (a certain month) permissible (to initiate an armed encounter) one year and make it (another certain month) prohibited (to initiate an armed encounter therein) in (another) year in order to adjust the number of the months prohibited by Allah (and) so (that) they may make Halal (permissible) what Allah has declared Haram (prohibited). (There is) made alluring to them the evil of their deeds. And Allah does not guide the nation of disbelievers","9:38":"O you people who have Believed! What (is the matter) with you? When it was said to you: “March forth in the Cause of Allah,” you clung heavily to the earth. Did you get satisfied with the life of this world in comparison to the Hereafter? So what is the enjoyment of the life of this world in comparison to the Hereafter — except a very very negligible one","9:39":"If you do not march forth (to defend or to establish the Religion of Allah) He will punish you with a painful torment and will replace (you) with a nation other than you and you will harm Him not in any way. And Allah is All-Capable over all things","9:40":"And if you help him not (it does not matter), for surely Allah has helped him when those who disbelieved made him leave. The second of the two — when both of them (stay) in the cave, when he says to his companion: “Be not depressed or anxious, surely Allah is with us (both).” Then Allah sent down His Sakinah upon him and provided him aid and assistance with forces — you saw them not. And He made the statement of those who disbelieved, as the lowermost; and the Kalimah (Statement or Slogan) of Allah: that (is) the Uppermost. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise","9:41":"March forth (whether) light (not properly armed) or heavy (fully armed) and strive hard with your possessions and your personalities in the Cause of Allah. This is better for you if you had been knowing (the truth)","9:42":"Had there been an immediate gain, and an easy journey, they would have followed you, but the hardship (of the journey and the season) appeared extreme to them. And they would soon swear by Allah: “If we only could, we would certainly have gone out with you.” They destroy their personalities, and Allah knows: certainly they, without doubt, are liars","9:43":"Allah has forgiven you, (but) why did you grant them permission until it had become clear to you (as to who were) those who spoke the truth and you had (also clearly) known the liars","9:44":"Do not ask your permission those who Believe in Allah and the Last Day that they may strive hard with their possessions and their personalities (in the Cause of Allah. Rather they come of their own as volunteers)","9:45":"Definitely it is that ask your permission those who do not have Faith in Allah and the Last Day; and their hearts fell in doubt, so they are in a state of doubt in their own (and thus) they waver","9:46":"And if they had intended to march out, certainly they would have arranged for it some preparation. But Allah became averse to their being sent forth, so He made them lag behind and (it) was said (to them): “Sit (behind) with those who sit (behind at their homes like the ill or the invalids)","9:47":"If they had marched out amongst you they would not have increased for you except disorder; and surely they would have hurried about in your midst. They seek against you Fitnah. And amongst you are listeners (who come to listen to you and then report back) in their interest (to the chief devils). And Allah is Fully Aware of the transgressors","9:48":"Verily, they sought Fitnah since before, and they would upset for you the matters until the Just became evident and the ordainment of Allah manifested (itself), and they (appeared as) those who are averse (to the encounters)","9:49":"And amongst them is that who says: “Grant me permission (to stay away from Qital) and do not put me to test.” Have they not (already) fallen into trial (and have failed in the test)? And Verily, Hell is surely all-surveillant for the disbelievers","9:50":"If reached you (some) good it hurts them, and if befell you a difficulty, they say: “We took our precaution beforehand,” and they turned away, and they (are) those who rejoice","9:51":"Say: “Never shall happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us. He is our Maula. And in Allah, let the Believers put (their) trust","9:52":"Say: “Do you wait for us but (definitely) one of the two ideal things (martyrdom or victory)? While we await for you (either) that Allah inflicts you punishment (directly) from Himself or at our hands. So wait, certainly we, alongwith you, are those who await.”","9:53":"Say: “Spend willingly or unwillingly, it shall never be accepted of you. Surely you: you people had been a nation of Fasiqun.”","9:54":"And did not stop them, that may be accepted from them their contributions, except that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger; and they do not come to As-Salat except while they feel reluctance; and they do not contribute except while they feel aversion","9:55":"So must not amaze you their possessions and their children. Surely, it is that Allah intends that He may put them to punishment thereby in the life of this world, and their souls may depart (from their bodies) while they (are) disbelievers","9:56":"And they swear by Allah: surely they (are) without doubt, of you. And they are not of you but they are a nation who create dissensions and sects","9:57":"If they shall find a place of refuge, or caves or anything where one can enter and hide himself, surely they would turn thereto, and they would rush uncontrollably","9:58":"And amongst them is that who accuses you about the donations (received). Then if they are given (a part) thereof, they got pleased, and if they are not given (any portion) thereof, then and there they go into rage","9:59":"And if (it was so) that they remained contented and satisfied (over) what Allah and His Messenger gave to them, and had said: “Allah (Alone) is sufficient to us, soon Allah shall provide us of His bounty, and (also) His Messenger. Surely we (are) attentive to Allah (in complete humility).”","9:60":"Surely, what is As-Sadaqat are meant for Fuqara, and Al-Masakin and the workers or staff handling and administering these (donations) and for those who keep their hearts (i.e., the hearts of those who revert to Islam) cemented. [These are those missionaries, preachers and messengers who call people towards the Ayaat of Al-Kitab and also see that the people who revert to Islam, stay in Islam in satisfaction, and with full inclination of hearts]. And (these are to be spent) in (arranging the freedom of) the necks (from all sorts of bondage of slavery and dependence), and for those in debts, and for the Cause of Allah and (for) a victim of travel (i.e., any traveller who has accidentally become a needy person) — (this is the) ordainment coming from Allah.

He has Faith in Allah, and he has Faith for the Believers and mercy for those who have Believed out of you.” And those who hurt the Messenger of Allah: for them is a grievous punishment","9:62":"They swear by Allah regarding you (Muslims) so that they may please you. Although ‘Allah and His Messenger’ have more right that they should please that (twain together), if they happened to be Believers","9:63":"Didn’t they know that it (is so, that) whoever shows hostility to Allah and His Messenger, so surely, for him is the Fire of Hell, (he becomes) a dweller therein? This is an extreme disgrace","9:64":"The hypocrites feel afraid (and apprehend) that a Surah regarding them would be sent which would make evident over them about what is in their hearts. Say: “You continue to ridicule! Certainly, Allah is the One Who brings out in the open what you apprehend","9:65":"If you ask them (about this), they will surely say: “Surely, it is that we talk idly and we play.” Say: “Whether, with Allah, and His Ayaat and His Messenger, you had been ridiculing?”","9:66":"Make no excuse; indeed, you have disbelieved after (getting) your Faith. If We overlook (and do not punish) a group amongst you, We will punish the (other) group because they were criminals","9:67":"The male hypocrites and the female hypocrites — some of them (are) from some (others). They enjoin what is forbidden and they forbid what is desirable (and ordained); and they keep closed their hands (and make no donations in Allah’s Cause). They have forgotten Allah, so He forgot them. Verily, the Munafiqun: they are the Fasiqun","9:68":"Allah has promised the male hypocrites and the female hypocrites and the disbelievers, the Fire of Hell. (They shall be) dwellers therein. It sufficed them and Allah has cursed them and for them is the lasting torment","9:69":"Like those before you, they were mightier than you in power, and more abundant in wealth and children. So they enjoyed with their portion, then you enjoyed with your portion in the same way as enjoyed those who went before you with their portion; and you indulged in purposeless activity as they indulged in purposeless activity. Those people: their deeds went in vain in this world and in the Hereafter. And those people: they (very ones are) the losers","9:70":"Has not reached them the news of those (who went) before them: the nation of Nuh, ’Ad, and Samud, and the nation of Ibrahim, and the residents of Madyan, and the habitations that indulged in forgery, imitation and plagiarism — came to them their Messengers with Al-Bayyinat? So Allah was not (such) that He may do injustice to them, but they had been doing injustice to themselves","9:71":"And the Believing males and the Believing females: some of them are auliya to some (others).

This: it is the supreme achievement","9:73":"O you Prophet! Strive hard against the disbelievers and hypocrites, and be very severe against them, and their abode is Hell, and (it is) an evil abode","9:74":"They swear by Allah what they said (as if they uttered nothing objectionable), although surely, they uttered a statement of disbelief, and they disbelieved after their (accepting) Islam and they resolved which they could not accomplish, and they did not retaliate except that Allah and His Messenger enriched them out of His bounty. And if they repent (and adopt the right Path) it will be better for them, and if they turned back, Allah will punish them with a painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter.

Verily, I fear, if I disobeyed my Nourisher-Sustainer, punishment on the great Day.”","10:16":"Say: “If Allah had willed I would not have recited it to you, nor He had made it known to you. So, verily, I have stayed amongst you a lifetime before this. Do you then not use your sense?”","10:17":"So, who is a bigger transgressor than that who forged a lie against Allah or denied His Ayaat? Surely it (is that) the criminals do not become successful","10:18":"And they obey besides Allah that hurts them not, nor gives them (any) profit and they say: “All these are intercessors to us unto Allah.” Say: “Do you inform Allah of that which He knows not in the heavens, and nor on the earth? He became glorified and became very High in comparison to what they assign as partners (to Him)","10:19":"And mankind is not but one single community, then they (due to various reasons) differed (among themselves). And if a commitment was not already given from your Nourisher-Sustainer, surely (the matter) would have been settled between them regarding what they differ therein","10:20":"And they say: “Why not has been sent to him a Sign from his Nourisher-Sustainer?” So, Say: “Definitely, what is unseen belongs to Allah, so wait you, verily I am with you, from amongst those who wait.”","10:21":"And when We made mankind taste mercy after the adversity that afflicted them, then for them (the evil pastime is) to plot against Our Ayaat. Say: “Allah is Swifter in plotting (against the criminals). Certainly Our messengers (angels) put to record whatever you plot (against Islam).”","10:22":"He it is Who enables you to travel through the land and the sea, till when you are in the ships and (the vessels) started sailing with these (passengers) with a favourable wind and (riders) became very happy with this (vessel), (there) came to this (vessel) a wind, very stormy and came to them the waves from all positions and they became sure that it (the vessel) is overwhelmed and encircled along with them, they invoked Allah, keeping pure for Him the Religion: “Surely if you rescued us from this, truly, we become out of those who are grateful","10:23":"So when He rescued them, immediately they rebel in the earth without any right. O you mankind! Definitely, what is your rebellion (it is) against your ownselves — a brief enjoyment of this worldly life, afterwards unto Us is your place of return; then We shall inform you about that which you used to do","10:24":"Certainly, what is the example of this worldly life (it is) like the rain, We sent it down from the direction of the sky, then got intermingled with it the produce from the earth of which eat humans and cattle, until when the earth adopted its beautiful adornment and got fully beautified and its custodians became sure that they are full controllers over it, Our command reached it by night or by day, then We made it like a clean-mown harvest as if it had not flourished yesterday. Thus We give details to the Ayaat for a nation who think and ponder","10:25":"And Allah calls to the home of peace (through His teachings in Al-Kitab) and guides whom He thinks proper to the Permanent Path","10:26":"For those who have done good in perfection is the perfect reward and much more. And humiliation shall not cover their faces and nor disgrace. They are the companions of Paradise. They, therein (are) dwellers","10:27":"And those who have earned evil deeds — the recompense of an evil deed is the like thereof, and disgrace shall cover them, there is not for them against Allah a defender. As it were, their faces got covered from the portion of the night that completely darkens (the sight). They are companions of the Fire. They will be dwellers therein","10:28":"And the Day We shall gather them all together, then We shall say to those who did set partners: “(Stop) at your place! You and your partners.” Then We broke the link between them. And their partners (whom they assigned in the Dominion of Allah) said: “You had not been paying obedience to us","10:29":"So Allah became Sufficient as a Witness between us and between you. Definitely, we had been truly unaware of your obedience (to us).”","10:30":"Then and there every Nafs will test what she sent before and they were brought back to Allah, their rightful Maula (Protector). And vanished from them whatever they had been inventing in falsehood","10:31":"Say: “Who provides you sustenance from the direction of the sky and from the earth? Or who owns the hearing and the sights? And who brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affair?” Then immediately they say: “Allah.” Then say: would you, then, not pay obedience (to Allah)?”","10:32":"Such is Allah, your Nourisher-Sustainer in truth. So what else (could there be) after the truth except losing the track? Then where are you being dispersed (away from the true-path)","10:33":"Thus proved true the statement of your Nourisher-Sustainer against those who disobeyed that they will not Believe","10:34":"Say: “Is there of your (assigned) partners that may initiate the creation (and) afterwards may repeat it?” Say: “Allah initiates the creation (and) afterwards shall repeat it. So how do you indulge in falsehood?”","10:35":"Say: “Is there of your (assigned) partners that may guide to the truth?” Say: “Allah guides to the truth. Is then That Who guides to the truth more worthy That He should be obeyed, or he who himself gets no guidance except when he is provided guidance. Then what is to you? How do you make opinion?”","10:36":"And the majority of them do not follow but (only) conjecture. Certainly, conjecture does not make (one) unconcerned regarding the truth to any extent. Surely, Allah is All-Aware of what they do","10:37":"And this Al-Quran is not such as could be falsely produced from (somebody) besides Allah; rather (it is) a verification and confirmation to what is in its two hands and details to Al-Kitab [the word 'Qur'an' means some thing which is read by emitting words. When Allah's Book is subjected to Qir'at, it confirms what is available in the written copies of the scripture already available anywhere in the world, and it also contains details to all the verdicts available in the Book]. There is no doubtful matter or interpolation therein, (it is) from the Nourisher-Sustainer of the worlds","10:38":"Do they say: ’ he has forged it ’ ? Say: ’Then come with a Surah similar to it and call upon whom you could besides Allah if you are truthful.”","10:39":"Nay! They have denied which they did not comprehend in the knowledge thereof, and yet the true understanding of it has not come to them. The same way denied those who (went) before them. Then ponder what was the final end of the transgressors","10:40":"And of them is that who Believes therein, and of them is that who does not believe therein. And your Nourisher-Sustainer knows more about the Mufsidun","10:41":"And if they have denied you, then say: “For me is my action and for you is your action. You are absolved-ones from that which I do and I stand absolved from that which you do.”","10:42":"And out of them are those who listen to you. Could you then make the deaf to hear even though they had been (those who) do not use intellect","10:43":"And among them is that who looks at you. Could then you give guidance to the blind even though they had not been using (their) sight","10:44":"Truly! Allah wrongs not mankind to any extent but mankind wrong their own selves","10:45":"And the Day He gathers them as if they stayed not except an hour of a day. They will recognise each other amongst them. Definitely, got ruined those who denied the meeting with Allah and they did not become guided","10:46":"And whether We show you (in your lifetime) some of what We promise them or We cause you to die — then unto Us is their returning place. Further on Allah is a Witness over what they do","10:47":"And to every Ummah (there is) a Messenger. So when their Messenger has come, (their case) got settled amongst them in justice. And they will not be wronged","10:48":"And they say: “When this Promise (will be implemented) if you are those who speak the truth?”","10:49":"Say: “I possess no power of harm, and nor of benefit for my Nafs except what Allah thought proper. For every Ummah (there is) a term appointed. When their appointed term approached, then they do not delay by an hour and nor they advance (even a moment).”","10:50":"Say: “Have you (ever) pondered if His punishment reached you by night or by day? What is that portion thereof the Mujrimun make haste (for that)","10:51":"Whether at that time when, what has already befallen, you developed Faith therein? What (happened to you? Is it) at this stage (that you have developed your Belief?) And indeed, you used to hasten it on (to yourself).”","10:52":"Then it was said to those who transgressed: “Taste you the everlasting punishment. Would you be rewarded (any thing else) except what you used to earn?”","10:53":"And they ask you for opinion and interpretation: “Whether it (i.e., the Day of Resurrection and punishment and reward therein) is a reality?” Say: “Of course! My Nourisher-Sustainer is (Himself) The Witness. Definitely, it is a sure reality and you are not of those who can obstruct (its appearance).”","10:54":"And if there had been with every Nafs that has transgressed, whatever is on the earth, she would have offered it as a ransom (to be redeemed of her transgression). And they kept hidden the regret when they saw the punishment; and the matter got decided amongst them in full justice. And they will not be wronged (on the Day of Resurrection and Accountability)","10:55":"Behold! Surely, belongs to Allah whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Beware! truly, the Promise from Allah is true, but the majority among them do not know","10:56":"He (it is Who) gives life and brings death; and unto Him you shall be returned","10:57":"O you mankind: “Definitely, has come to you Mauizah from your Nourisher-Sustainer and Shifah le-ma-fi-as-Sudoor and Huda and Rahmah for the Believers","10:58":"Say: “In the Bounty of Allah and in His Mercy through this, they must rejoice. That is better than what they amass","10:59":"Say: “Have you (ever) pondered? What Allah has provided you as provision, so you have (on your own) made out of it lawful and unlawful.” Say: “Has Allah permitted you or do you invent a lie against Allah?”","10:60":"And what is the idea of those who invent a lie against Allah about the Day of Resurrection? Truly, Allah is full of grace to mankind but most of them do not pay thanks","10:61":"In whatever involvement you may be and whatever you may recite thereof from Qur’an — and you do not produce any action but We are over you as Witnesses when you people are involved in it. And nothing hides (itself) from your Nourisher-Sustainer (not) even the weight of a particle on the earth and nor in the heaven — and nor smaller than this and nor larger — but (it is recorded) in a manifest record","10:62":"Behold! Verily, the auliya of Allah (protectors and helpers for His System of Guidance) — there is no fear over them and nor they shall go in grief","10:63":"those who Believed and they had been paying obedience","10:64":"for them are glad tidings in the life of this world and in the Hereafter.

He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower","10:66":"Behold! Verily, to Allah belongs whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is on the earth. And do not obey those who invoke besides Allah, the partners. They do not obey except conjecture and nothing they (do) but they harbour delusions","10:67":"He it is Who has appointed for you the night so that you may rest therein, and the day as one which makes things visible. Surely, in this are indeed signs for a nation who listen","10:68":"They (who have deviated from the Book of Allah) said: “Allah has begotten a son.” His Glory keeps Him absolved of it. He is Free of all needs. To Him belongs what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. For this (false accusation) you have no proof with you. Do you say concerning Allah what you know not","10:69":"Say: “Verily, those who forge a lie against Allah will not achieve success\" —","10:70":"a brief enjoyment in this world, then unto Us will be their returning place; then We shall make them taste the severest punishment because they used to disbelieve","10:71":"And reproduce before them the news of Nuh when he said to his nation: “O my nation! If it came very hard on you: my presence and my missionary pursuit with the help of Ayaatillahe, then in Allah I have put my trust.

My reward is not (due on anyone) except on Allah, and I have been commanded that I may become out of the Muslims.”","10:73":"So they denied him. So We delivered him and those with him in the Ark and We appointed them as the successor-generations (who inherited the earth) while We drowned (in the great deluge all) those who belied Our Ayaat. Then ponder how was the final end of those who were warned","10:74":"Then We raised after him Messengers over the (future) nation of these people, so they came to them with Al-Bayyinat, but they would not Believe what they had already rejected beforehand. Thus We put up a seal on the hearts of those who break the limits","10:75":"Then We raised after them Musa and Harun to Firaun and his chiefs with Our Signs. But they behaved arrogantly and they happened to be a nation of criminals","10:76":"So when came to them Al-Haqq from Us, they said: “Without doubt, this is surely magic, fully manifest.”","10:77":"Musa said: “Do you say about Al-Haqq when it has reached you: Is this magic? But the magicians never succeed.”","10:78":"They said: “Have you come to us to deviate us from that we found following it our fathers; and you desire that the greatness (and position) in the land becomes restricted to you two? And we are not (becoming) Believers for you two.”","10:79":"And Firaun said (to his administrators): “Produce before me every expert magician.”","10:80":"And when the magicians came, Musa said to them: “Place on the ground whatever you want to put down.”","10:81":"Then when they dropped (their items) on the ground, Musa said: “What you came alongwith is sorcery. Surely, Allah, very soon, will prove it false. Verily, Allah does not reform the work of Al-Mufsidun","10:82":"And Allah will establish Al-Haqq as true with the help of His statements (therein) even if the Mujrimun felt aversion","10:83":"But did not Believe in Musa (anyone) except the younger generation of his nation because of the fear of Firaun and their chiefs, lest they should put them to persecution and torture; and verily, Firaun behaved as an arrogant tyrant on the earth, and indeed he was surely of the Musrifun (those who breahead of state the limits, indulge in transgression)","10:84":"And Musa said: “O my nation! If you have developed Faith in Allah then put your trust in Him if you are (really) Muslims.”","10:85":"So they said: “In Allah we have put our trust. Our Nourisher-Sustainer! Make us not a trial for the nation of the transgressors","10:86":"And save us by Your Mercy from the nation of disbelievers.”","10:87":"And We sent inspiration to Musa and his brother that: 'Both of you specify for the nation of you two the houses in Egypt. And regard your (such) houses as Qiblah and establish salat and give glad tidings to the Believers.’","10:88":"And Musa said: “Our Nourisher-Sustainer!

So you both stick to your stand and you two do not follow the path of those who do not know (the requirements of Faith).”","10:90":"And We separated the sea with Bani Israiel, and Firaun and his forces chased them in rebellion and enmity (against Allah and Islam) until when drowning overtook him, he said: “I have Believed that it (is a fact that there is) no god except That in Whom the Bani Israiel have developed Faith and I am out of the Muslims.”","10:91":"(Allah made him realise): “At this stage?

Verily, I (will prove myself as) ever-guarding, ever-knowing.”","12:56":"And thus We established (vast authority) for Yusuf in the country. He stays and moves therein as and when he likes. We reach with Our mercy on whom We think proper and We do not allow to go waste the reward of those who do righteousness in perfection","12:57":"And indeed, the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who have Believed and used to pay obedience (to Allah through the teachings in Al-Kitâb)","12:58":"And Yusuf’s brethren came and they entered unto him. So he recognised them but they, regarding him, were those who recognised (him) not","12:59":"And when (Yusuf through his subordinate staff) furnished them forth with the rations due to them, (in accordance with the details of the family-members as provided by the brethren), he said: “Come to me with the brother of yours, from your father. Do you not see that I give you full measure and that I am of the best of hosts","12:60":"But if you do not come to me with him, then there shall be no measure (of corn) for you with me, nor shall you come near me.”","12:61":"They said: “Soon we shall make his father to part with him. And surely, we are indeed about to do (it).”","12:62":"And (Yusuf) asked his staff-members: “Put back their money (which has been charged for the ration-supplied) into their shopping bags, so that they might recognise it when they go back to their family-members, in order that they might return back (to us).”","12:63":"So when they returned to their father, they said: “O our father! (Bringing in) measure (of corn) has been banned to us (unless our half-brother from you accompanies us), so send with us our brother, (only then) we get our measure, and indeed we, for him, will surely be protectors.”","12:64":"(Yaqub) said: \"Would I trust you regarding him, except as I trusted you regarding his brother aforetime? So Allah is the Best as Protector, and He is a Better Bestower of Mercy among those who bestow mercy","12:65":"And when they unsealed their purchases, they found their sum (paid charges) returned to them. They said: “O our father! What else do we desire? This, our money has been returned to us. And (now) we make (more) purchases for our family and we shall protect our brother, and we shall add one more measure of a camel’s load. This quantity would be oversufficient.”","12:66":"(Yaqub) said: “I will never send him with you until you provide me a firm assurance from Allah (i.e., you make Allah a Witness over the assurance) that you will come to me with him unless you are (all) encircled.” So when they gave him their assurance, he said: “Allah is the Disposer of affairs over what we utter.”","12:67":"And (Yaqub further) said: “O my dear sons! Do not enter (all) through one entrance, rather enter through different gates, and I am of no benefit to you against Allah (if He has some adverse plans) in any way. The decision is not (a legitimate right) except for Allah. In Him I have put my trust. And in Him, let all, who entrust the trust, put their trust.”","12:68":"And when they entered in the manner their father had commanded them, it was not that it could benefit them against Allah in any way, except that a desire in the mind of Yaqub which he fulfilled. And indeed he (i.e., Yaqub) was surely possessed of knowledge because of what We taught him. But the majority of mankind do not know (these facts)","12:69":"And when they went towards Yusuf, he made his (real) brother to stay with him. He said: “Surely I, I am your (real) brother, so grieve not for what they had been doing (with us both).”","12:70":"So at length when (Yusuf) had furnished them forth with their rations, he put the drinhead of state-cup in the shopping bag of his brother. Later on an announcer announced: “O you in the caravan, surely you are indeed thieves.”","12:71":"(The brethren) said while they came closer to them (i.e., to the staff-members): “What is that which you misplace and (then) search?”","12:72":"They said: “We misplace and search the drinhead of state-cup of the head of state; and for him who comes with it (is the reward of) a camel-load.” (Now Yusuf himself said): “And I am that who gives a surety for this (reward).”","12:73":"(The brethren) said: “Allah be Witness! Indeed, you people knew that we have not come that we make mischief in the land, and we are not thieves.”","12:74":"They (Yusuf’s men) said: “So what should be the punishment for that (theft) if you are (proved to be) liars?”","12:75":"They (the brethren) said: “The punishment for it — he in whose shopping bag it is found, so he is (the) ransome for it . Thus we punish the wrong-doers.”","12:76":"So, (Yusuf) began (the search) through their bags before the bag of his (real) brother. Then he brought it out of his brother's bag. Thus did We plan for Yusuf. (It) was not (possible for Yusuf) that he may detain his brother under the law (and constitution) of Al-Malik, except when Allah wills it. We raise in ranks whom We think proper. And over all those endued with knowledge is the All-Knowing (Allah)","12:77":"(Half-brothers together) said: “If he steals, so without doubt did steal a brother-german to him, before.” So Yusuf kept it (i.e., the emotional reaction to this false charge) hidden in himself and he did not make it evident before them; (and only) said: \"You people are in a dangerous form, and Allah knows better what you allege.”","12:78":"They said: “O you Al-Aziz! Verily, for him (is his) father, a very, very old man, so detain one of us in his place. Indeed we: we see you out of those who do righteousness in perfection.”","12:79":"(Yusuf) said: “(I seek) refuge of Allah that we may detain except that with whom we found our property. Indeed, in that case we are surely transgressors","12:80":"So when they lost all hope from him they collected at one place all alone, discussing in privacy. Said their eldest: “Don’t you know that your father did take an assurance from you in Allah’s Name, and before this how you damaged (the promise) about Yusuf? So I will never leave the place until my father gave permission to me, or Allah gives judgement in my favour, and He is the Best of judges","12:81":"Go back to your father and say, ‘O our father! Verily, your son has committed theft, and we did not directly see except what we came to know, and we are not protectors for what is unseen and hidden","12:82":"And ask the town where we had been and the caravan in which we reached (you), and indeed we are surely those who speak the truth.”","12:83":"(Yaqub) said: “Nay! Your ownselves have given for you a plan. So (I can give nothing except) desirable patience. May be Allah will bring them all back to me. Truly He, Only He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.”","12:84":"And (Yaqub) turned away from them and said: “Ya-asafa-ala-Yusuf [Alas, (my) grief for Yusuf’! (Please note that the word ‘Yusuf’ itself gives such a meaning in classical Arabic. The proper names of most of the Prophets are such that they point to some historical/personal incidents related to them. This we appreciate when the spelling and pronunciation as given in Al-Kitâb are put to this test. The pronunciation and spellings as given in ‘Old Testament’ and ‘New Testament’ have completely damaged this interesting aspect of knowledge)]. And his both eyes became white resulting from sorrow, and he (was) one who was suppressing, controlling and bearing (it)","12:85":"They said: “By Allah! You take decision that you will go on remembering Yusuf until you become exhausted or you be out of those who perish (in grief).”","12:86":"(Yaqub) said: “Surely, I complain of my sorrow and grief to Allah (Alone), and I know from Allah what you do not know","12:87":"O my sons! Go and enquire about Yusuf and his brother, and do not give up hope of Allah’s Mercy. Certainly it is that one does not despair of Allah’s Mercy except the nation of disbelievers.”","12:88":"So when they entered unto him (i.e., unto Yusuf), they said: “O you Al-Aziz! A hard time has hit us and our family, and we have come with merchandise, meagre in value/made available with difficulty. Then complete for us the measure and apply charitable charges to us. Verily, Allah does reward the charitable.”","12:89":"(Yusuf) said: “Did you come to realise what you did with Yusuf and his brother (- german) when you were ignorant (of the Law of Allah)?!”","12:90":"They said: “What? Surely, you, indeed you are Yusuf?” He said: “I am Yusuf, and this is my brother. Certainly, Allah has bestowed His abundant Grace over us. Certainly it is that one who pays obedience and shows perseverance, then surely Allah does not allow to go waste the reward of those who do good in perfection.”","12:91":"They said “By Allah! Verily, Allah preferred you over us, and side by side we became, indeed, the sinners.”","12:92":"He said: “There is no blame on you (from me) this day; Allah will forgive you, and He is More Merciful of those who bestow mercy","12:93":"Go with this shirt of mine, and lay it down on the face of my father, he will be one who can see clearly and powerfully. And come (back) to me with your family-members altogether”","12:94":"And when the caravan departed, their father said: “Definitely I, indeed I get the smell of Yusuf (ie, I feel the presence of Yusuf), if it is not that you blame me of talhead of state illogically.”","12:95":"(People around) said: “By Allah, surely you are indeed in your persistent error.”","12:96":"Then when the bearer of the happy news arrived, he cast it (ie, the shirt) over his face, then and there he reverted to one who can see clearly. He said: “Did I not say to you, ‘surely I know from Allah what you do not know.”","12:97":"They said: “O our father! Seek forgiveness for us regarding our sins; indeed, we have been sinners.”","12:98":"He said: “Soon I invoke my Nourisher-Sustainer in forgiveness for you. Verily He, only He is the Oft-Forgiving, the continuously Merciful","12:99":"Then, when they (all the family-members together) entered unto Yusuf he made his parents sit close to himself and said: “Enter Egypt, if Allah willed, as those in complete security and peace.”","12:100":"And he brought his parents up on the throne and they (i.e., the father, the mother, the brother-german and the ten half-brothers — altogether) fell down prostrate (before Allah) in appreciation to him (when they witnessed the position and high rank of Yusuf). And (Yusuf) said: “O my dear father! This (becomes) the interpretation (in physical form) of my dream (which I saw as vision) before. Indeed, my Nourisher-Sustainer has made it a reality. And indeed, He did kindness to me when He brought me out of the prison, and He came with you (all) out of the rural-area, after Satan had sown enmity between me and between my brothers. Certainly, my Nourisher-Sustainer is (the) Keenest Observer for whom He thinks proper. Truly He! Only He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise","12:101":"My Nourisher-Sustainer! You have indeed bestowed on me of the sovereignty, and you taught me the interpretation of Al-Ahadees (‘The narrations’), the Initiator of the heavens and the earth! You are my Wali in this world and the Hereafter; cause me to die as a Muslim and intermingle me with the righteous.”","12:102":"This is of the news of the hidden and unseen, which We reveal in inspiration to you. And you were not near them when they jointly prepared their stratagem and they plot (against Yusuf)","12:103":"And the majority of mankind is not becoming Believers even if you desired vehemently","12:104":"And you do not ask them, over it (on transmitting them the correct news about events through reciting the Ayaât of Al-Kitâb) any of the reward. It (i.e., Al-Kitâb) is not but a Message to the worlds","12:105":"And how many a sign in the heavens and the earth they pass by, while they show aversion therefrom","12:106":"And the majority of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners [in His Dominion (in their concepts, beliefs as well as practical deeds]","12:107":"Have they felt secure that comes to them, out of the torment of Allah, Ghashiyah? Or comes to them the Hour, all of a sudden while they perceive (it) not","12:108":"Tell (them): “This is my way of life, I invite to Allah on the basis of sound knowledge, I as well as who has followed me.

Do you not then use (your) intellect","12:110":"Until when the Messengers almost lost all hope (of reform) and they became sure that they were indeed rejected and belied, there came to them Our Assistance, so was saved and rescued that whom We think proper.

(This Al-Kitâb) is not (a collection of) forged and concocted Hadees.

And that which has been sent to you from your Nourisher-Sustainer is the Truth, but the majority of mankind do not believe","13:2":"Allah is That Who raised the heavens without a pillar which you may see, then He set (Himself) over the throne.

Rather, when both give identical evidence the punishment gets averted from the female — indicating that the evidence given by her has more credence and it prevails over the evidence given by her husband. Also note that ‘curse of Allah’ has been mentioned to warn the male, while much milder phrase ‘wrath of Allah’ has been used to warn the female. And the most important point evident and manifest over here is that the word Azaab in Verse No. 2 and Verse No. 8 refers to one and the same punishment — ‘to flog one hundred stripes in public.’ Allah’s Book makes no distinction between a married and an unmarried person, or between a male and a female regarding this punishment. No punishment, other than flogging, is mentioned for Zina anywhere, throughout the Text of Al-Kitab. We must now ponder as to why Allah placed the first verse in this Surah which acts as a pre-amble as well as a warning. Allah, the All-Knowing and All-Aware knew beforehand that books written and produced by humans would attempt to override the ordainments of the Book of Allah and create confusion about the law of punishment applicable to Zina]","24:10":"And if (there is) not the Grace of Allah over you, and His Mercy (you would be disturbing your marital lives and breahead of state up your families without reason) — and that Allah is the One Who accepts repentance, the All-Wise","24:11":"Verily, those who came forward with the slander (a false charge against a chaste personality) are a small group out of you people.

[This verse gives a start to the directions and admonitions to control and regulate the behaviour of the society. This counselling continues in many verses that follow. The wordings in this verse indicate that the incident of slander was cooked up on the basis of something which was noticed and misunderstood when a person entered in a house out of a sudden, without ashead of state permission of the inmates. Those who have not pondered over the Divine words have wrongly accepted another incident which was forged to malign the Last Prophet’s marital life]","24:28":"And if you do not find therein anyone, then do not enter it until the permission is granted for you. And if it is said to you: 'Go back’. Then you go back. That is more desirable of you.

Verily, it is I, Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise","27:10":"And put you down your rod!\" But when he marked it (that) it moves, as if it (is) a snake, he turned being one who turns his back and did not return. (It was said): “O Musa! Fear not. Verily, the Messengers fear not in My Presence","27:11":"except that who has done wrong, (and) afterwards has brought in replacement good after evil; then surely, I am Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful","27:12":"And put your hand into your bosom, it will come forth white without any disease. (These are) among the nine credentials to Firaun and his nation. Surely, they are a nation of those who are Fasiqun","27:13":"So when Our enlightening Credentials came to them, they said: “This is manifest magic.”","27:14":"And they insulted and mocked these (credentials) — although their ownselves did get influenced by these — wrongfully and arrogantly. So see what was the end of the Mufsidun","27:15":"And surely, indeed We bestowed knowledge to Daud and Sulaiman, and they both said: “Selective Praise suits Allah (Alone) Who has preferred us in rank above many of His Believing Ibad.”","27:16":"And Sulaiman inherited (the possessions and qualities of) Daud. And he said: “O mankind! We have been taught the language of the birds, and we have been bestowed from all things. Surely, this indeed: it is the evident grace","27:17":"And there were made to assemble, before Sulaiman, his regiments of jinns, and humans, and birds. So they are set in groups (ready to move) —","27:18":"until when they entered unto the valley of the ants, one she-ant said: “O you ants! Enter your dwellings, lest Sulaiman and his regiments crush you, while they perceive not.”","27:19":"So (Sulaiman) smiled, (becoming) one who laughs at her utterance and said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Grant me (the initiative and desire) that I may pay thanks for Your Grace that You have showered upon me and upon my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds with which You may agree, and admit me under cover of Your Mercy, among your righteous Ibad","27:20":"And (Sulaiman) made the (military) review of the (regiments of the) birds, and said: “What is (gone wrong) with me that I do not see the hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees","27:21":"I will surely punish him with a severe punishment, or I will surely slaughter him, or he must return to me with some convincing reasoning.”","27:22":"But (the hoopoe) tarried not long. So (he came back and) said: “I have surveyed what you survey not thereof. And I have returned to you from (the head of statedom of) Saba with an authentic information","27:23":"Certainly I found a woman; she rules over them, and she has been bestowed with all sorts of things (which a ruler may possess) and to her is a gorgeous throne","27:24":"I found her and her nation: they prostrate to the sun instead of Allah, and Satan has made their deeds fair-seeming to them, and has barred them from the (Right) way, so they receive not the guidance","27:25":"(and) that they do not prostrate to Allah Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth and Knows what you conceal and what you reveal","27:26":"Allah! La-ilaha-illa-Huwa, the Nourisher-Sustainer to the Supreme Throne!”","27:27":"(Sulaiman) said: “Soon We shall see whether you spoke the truth or you are out of those who misquote","27:28":"Go you, with this Kitab (Book) of mine, and deliver it to them; then withdraw from them and see what is that response with which they return (to me)","27:29":"(The female ruler) said: “O you chiefs! Verily, me — has been delivered to me, unto me Kitab-un-Kareem (a Noble Book)","27:30":"Verily, it is from Sulaiman, and verily it (takes a start thus): With the name of Allah — the Bestower of unlimited mercy, the continuously Merciful","27:31":"(and) that: 'Be you not exalted against me and come to me as Muslims.' ”","27:32":"She said: “O you chiefs! Advise me in (this) case of mine. I am not a lady who takes decision until you are present with me (to give your assent).”","27:33":"They said: “We are possessors of (great) might and possessors of (capacity for) intense war, but the decision lies with you; so think over what is that which you will command.”","27:34":"She said: “Verily, the sovereign rulers, when they entered any habitation, they despoiled it and made the more honourable of its citizens as the more disgraced ones, and thus they will do","27:35":"And verily, I am going to send them (my men) with a present, then (I will be) one who will watch and see with what the messengers return.”","27:36":"So when (the messengers with the royal gift) came to Sulaiman, he said: “Will you provide me aid and assistance in the form of wealth and provisions? So, what Allah has given me is better than what He has given you. Nay, you rejoice in your gift","27:37":"Go back to them. Then verily, we shall come to them with (military) forces — there is no capacity with them (i.e., with the forces of Saba) for (facing) these (Muslim regiments). And we shall surely drive them out from this (land of Saba) in disgrace, and they (will be) those who have surrendered.”","27:38":"(Sulaiman now addressed the chiefs in his state and) said: “O you chiefs! Which of you comes to me with her throne prior to that they may come to me as Muslims?”","27:39":"An Ifrit (strong one) from the jinns said: “I will come to you with that before you rise from your sitting. And verily, I am, for this, indeed strong and trustworthy.”","27:40":"Said that with whom was knowledge from Al-Kitab : “I will come to you with it even earlier than ' the margin of your eyelid returns to you' (i.e., within the twinkling of an eye).\" So when he saw it placed before him, he said: \"This is by the Grace of my Nourisher-Sustainer so that He may test me whether I become grateful or I become ungrateful. And whoever pays thanks (to Allah, it is) for his own self, and whoever became ungrateful — then certainly my Nourisher-Sustainer is Free of all wants, Bountiful.”","27:41":"(Sulaiman) said: “Disguise and transform in her interest, her throne (by removing all signs and engravings that depict polytheism or disbelief). We shall see whether she receives guidance or she becomes of those who do not receive guidance.”","27:42":"So when she came, it was said (to her): \" Is this like your throne?” She said: “As though it is that very one. And Al-Ilm (‘The Knowledge’) has been delivered to us even before this and we have become Muslims.”","27:43":"And (Sulaiman’s effort) stopped her from that which she used to worship besides Allah. Surely, she used to be of a nation of disbelievers","27:44":"It was said to her: “Enter the palace.” But as she saw it, she assessed it to be a wide expanse of water running in waves and she tucked up (her clothes) off her both calves (so that she may cross it over gracefully). (Sulaiman) said: “Truly, it is a palace (underneath which runs a river, simulating the delights in Paradise) paved smooth with slab of crystal-clear glass. She said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Verily, I have wronged myself and I have accepted Islam in the presence of Sulaiman in complete devotion to Allah, the Nourisher-Sustainer to the worlds.”","27:45":"And surely, indeed We sent to Samud (people) their brother Salih, (saying) that: “Pay obedience to Allah.” Then when they (broke up into) two sects, they quarrel among each other","27:46":"He said: “O my nation! Why do you hasten in evil before good? Why don’t you ask Allah for forgiveness so that you: you may be showered mercy","27:47":"They said: “We augured ill omen from you and whoever is with you.” He said: “Your (belief about) ill omen is (under record) with Allah; nay, you are a people put under test and trial.”","27:48":"And there were in the city nine bands of men: they create mischief in the land and do not indulge in (any) reform","27:49":"They said : \" Swear one to another by Allah that we shall make a secret night attack on him and his household; afterwards we will surely say to his heir-attorney: ‘We witnessed not the slaying place of his household and verily, we are surely those who tell the truth","27:50":"And they devised a plot and We planned an stratagem while they perceive (it) not","27:51":"Then see how was the final end of their plot — that We destroyed them and their nation, all together","27:52":"So these are their houses in utter ruin as they transgressed. Surely, in this is indeed a lesson for a nation who know","27:53":"And We rescued those who Believed and used to obey (Allah)","27:54":"And (bring to mind) Lout when he said to his nation: “Do you indulge in Al-Fahisha while you see (the evil aspect thereof)","27:55":"Is it (that) surely you people indeed approach men in sexual lust instead of women? Nay, you are a nation: you behave senselessly","27:56":"So there was no answer from his nation except that they said: “Drive out the family of Lout from your town. Verily, they are humans who remain clean and sanctified.”","27:57":"So We saved him and his household except his wife. We destined her to be of those who buried themselves under dust and debris","27:58":"And We rained down over them a rain (of stones). So evil became the rain cast over those who were warned (in advance)","27:59":"Say: “Selective Praise suits Allah (Alone), and peace be upon His Ibad whom He selected and chose (for His Message). Is Allah better, or (all) that they ascribe as partners (to Allah)?”","27:60":"Is That One Who created the heavens and the earth and sent down for you water from towards the sky (better or other gods)?

He weakens a group amongst them (who were regarded Muslims), he slaughters their sons and lets their females survive. Surely, he was of the Mufsidun","28:5":"And (on the other hand) We wish that We may do special favour unto those who have been made weak in the land and We make them aimma (imams) and we set them as the inheritors (of the state)","28:6":"And We may set effective establishment for them on the earth, and We make Firaun and Haman and the forces of these two from amongst them see what they used to fear and guard against","28:7":"And (to implement My long-term scheme and stratagem) We sent Wahi (Inspiration) to the mother of Musa (saying) that: “Suckle him, but when you became afraid regarding him (that he might be slaughtered under orders and policy of Firaun), then drop him into the river; and do not fear, and do not grieve. Verily, We are Who bring him back to you, and Who appoint him (one) of (Our) Messengers.”","28:8":"Then the household of Firaun picked him up (from the waters of the river) so that he becomes to them an enemy and a (cause of) grief (in accordance with the plan of Allah). Verily, Firaun and Haman and the forces of these two (under effect of Allah’s Plan) became those who did blunder","28:9":"And the (pious and Muslim) wife of Firaun said: “This babe must be welcomed as a comfort of the eye for me and for you. Slay him not, perhaps he may give benefit to us or we will adopt him as a son.” And they do not perceive (how the Plan of Allah is unfolding itself)","28:10":"And the heart of the mother of Musa got perturbed and became restless. If she could she would have definitely made it evident had We not placed restrictions on her heart so that she remains of those who are Believers","28:11":"And she said to his (Musa's) sister: “Follow him in his movement.\" So she (the sister) watched him (in the style of a stranger) from afar, while they perceive not (the purpose of the girl moving along the flow of the river)","28:12":"And We prohibited unto him the foster-sucklings beforehand, (so Musa refused all foster-mothers provided to him — till the time his sister reached him). So she said: “Shall I direct you people to a household: they will rear him for you, and they, to him, will be sincere well-wishers and trainers?”","28:13":"So We restored him to his mother that her eye may feel satisfaction and she might not grieve and that she might realise that the Promise of Allah is True. But the majority of the people do not know","28:14":"And when he attained his full strength and became perfect We bestowed unto him Hukman (decision-power) and Ilman (knowledge, in accordance with Allah’s Book). And thus do We reward the Muhsinun (those who do good in perfection without expecting any reward from men)","28:15":"And he entered the city at a time of unawareness from its residents, and he found therein two male-adults fighting among themselves — this (one) from his group, and this (one) from (the group of) his enemy. Then he who was from his group asked him for assistance against that who was from (the group of) his enemy. So Musa struck him with a fist and he (through this blunt injury) completed (his life-span) to him (i.e., the man died). (Musa) said: “This is out of Satan’s handiwork; indeed he is an enemy, a manifest misleader.”","28:16":"(Musa) said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Verily, I have wronged myself, so forgive me.” So He forgave him. Surely, He: He is the Oft-Forgiving, the continuously Merciful","28:17":"(Musa) said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! With what (swiftness) You showered grace over me, so I will never be a helper for criminals","28:18":"He faced the morning in the city as one who is apprehensive; he also feels cautious. So, behold! That one who sought his help the day before, (again) calls him for help. Musa said to him: “Surely, you are indeed an evidently misguided one.”","28:19":"So when as he intended that he may get hold of that: he is an enemy to both of them, he said: “O Musa! Do you intend that you may slay me as you killed a person yesterday? You do not intend but that you become a tyrant in the land; and you do not intend that you become of those who bring reform.”","28:20":"And there came a male-adult, from the farther end of the city: he runs hastily. He said: “O Musa! Verily, the chiefs (of the state) are tahead of state counsel together about you that they may kill you, so escape (immediately). Truly, I am to you of those who (are well-wishers and) give sincere advice","28:21":"So (Musa) escaped from there as one who is apprehensive and in fear — he feels very cautious. He said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Rescue me from the nation of Zalimun (transgressors)","28:22":"And when he turned his attention to the way leading to Madyan, he said: “It may be, my Nourisher-Sustainer: that He guides me to the rightness of the Path","28:23":"And when he arrived at the water (-supply point) of Madyan he found thereat a group of people: they provide water (to their flocks). And he found besides them two women: they keep (their flocks) back. He said: “What is the problem with you?” Both the females said: “We do not water (our flocks) until the shepherds remove (their flocks). And our father is a very old man.”","28:24":"So he watered (the flocks) for both of them. Then he turned back to a shade and said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Truly I am, for what You have bestowed on me out of good and palatable — one who is in need","28:25":"Then there came to him one of those two. She walks shyly, bashfully and modestly. She said: “Verily, my father calls you that he may pay you a reward for how you watered (our flocks) for us.” So when he came to him and narrated unto him the incident, he said: “Fear you not. You have escaped from the nation of the criminals.”","28:26":"One of those two (damsels) said: “O my father! Hire him. Verily, the best whom you hired (if you agree) is strong and trust worthy.”","28:27":"(The father) said (to Musa): \"Surely, I intend that I may give you in Nikah (wedlock) one of my two daughters — these two, on condition that you assist me (in my household work) eight years, but if you extended (it to) ten (years) then (it is) of your own accord. And I do not intend that I may burden you. Very soon you find me, if Allah willed (it so) out of the righteous ones","28:28":"(Musa) said: “That (stands settled) between me and between you. Whichever of the two terms I fulfilled, then there will be no injustice to me, and Allah is Surety over what we say.”","28:29":"So when Musa completed the prescribed period and moved with his family, he perceived in the direction of the mount (something like) fire. He said to his family: “Wait, surely I have perceived a fire; may be, I come to you therefrom with a news or a burning brand from the fire, so that you may warm yourselves.”","28:30":"So when he reached it, he was called from the side of the blessed valley, within the auspicious platform, from the direction of the tree, informing him that: “O Musa! Verily, I, I am Allah, the Nourisher-Sustainer to the worlds.”","28:31":"And that: “Put down your rod!” But when he saw it: it moves as if it is a snake, he turned away showing his back and did not return. (Allah called him again): “O Musa! come closer and fear not. Verily, you are of those who have found peace and protection","28:32":"Put your hand in your bosom, it will come forth white without a disease, and draw your limb close to your side (as a preventive) from (becoming a cause of) fear. These are two credentials from your Nourisher-Sustainer unto Firaun and his chiefs. Verily, they have become a nation of rebellious and disobedients.”","28:33":"He said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! I have indeed killed (without intention) from amongst them a man, so I fear that they will kill me","28:34":"And my brother Harun — he is more eloquent, in comparison to me, in speech, so send him alongwith me as a help — he will verify and confirm me. Verily I, I fear that they will belie me.”","28:35":"(Allah) said: “Soon We will strengthen your arm through your brother and set for both of you a shield, so they shall not close-up to either of you. With Our Ayaat, you two and whoever followed you two will be the victors (i.e., those who prevail).”","28:36":"So when Musa came to them with Ayaatina Bayyinatin (‘Our Manifest Signs’), they said: “This is not but forged magic; and we did not hear about this (type of counsellings and admonitions) among our initial fathers.”","28:37":"And Musa said: “My Nourisher-Sustainer knows better about that who came with the Guidance from His Presence, and that for whom becomes a happy ending in the staying-place (of the Hereafter). Certain it is that the transgressors do not attain success","28:38":"And Firaun said: “O you chiefs! I knew not for you any god other than me; so prepare for me energy-power, O Haman, on the ground, then build and manufacture for me a Sarhan in order that I catch information about the Ilah (God) of Musa; and surely, indeed, I regard him out of the liars.”","28:39":"And he and his forces behaved arrogantly and defiantly on the earth without due right, and they thought that they would not be returned towards Us","28:40":"So We seized him and his forces, then We threw them into the sea. So behold how was the final end of the transgressors","28:41":"And We have made them aimmah (imams or leaders), they will invite (people) to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped","28:42":"And We made attached to them in this world a curse, and on the Day of Resurrection, they (will be) out of those who stand despised and disgraced","28:43":"And surely, indeed We gave Musa Al-Kitab, after We had destroyed the earlier generations, as Basaira linnas (Eye Sights for mankind) and Hudah (Guidance), and Rahmah (Mercy), so that they might remind (themselves and remind others)","28:44":"And you were not on the western side (of the valley, along the mountain) when We completed to Musa the command (directing him to proceed to Firaun); and you are not among the witnesses","28:45":"But We brought forth generations, then the life became prolonged for them. And you became not a dweller among the residents of Madyan (that) you (may) reproduce unto them Ayaatina, but We, We remained those who send Messengers","28:46":"And you were not by the side of the mountain when We did call (Musa to appoint him as a Prophet). But (you too are appointed as a Prophet and Messenger) as a mercy from your Nourisher-Sustainer so that you may warn a nation — (there) has not come to them out of a warner (in the near-past) before you, in order that they may remind themselves and remind others","28:47":"And if had it not been (for the fact) that an affliction befalls them because of what their hands have sent before (them) and they may say: “My Nourisher-Sustainer! Why didn’t You send unto us a Messenger so that we might follow Your Ayaat and we become out of the Believers ?”","28:48":"But when Al-Haqq has come to them from Us, they said: “Why he has not been delivered the like of what was delivered to Musa?” Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Musa before? They said: “Two magics, each helping the other.” And they said: “Verily, we are disbelievers to all (this).”","28:49":"Say: “Then come over with a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than these two [i.e., Musa and the Divine Book (so that)] I may follow it, if you are truthful.”","28:50":"But if they responded you not, then know that what (is a fact is that) they follow their vain desires. And who is more astray than that who followed his (own) desire without guidance from Allah? Verily, Allah does not guide the nation of the transgressors","28:51":"And surely, indeed We have kept uninterrupted for them Al-Qawl (‘The Word’ or ‘The Statement’), so that they may remind themselves and remind others","28:52":"Those to whom We gave Al-Kitab (‘The Scripture’) before this, they Believe in this (re-delivery of the same original, to you)","28:53":"And when it is reproduced to them, they said: “We have Believed in this. It is Al-Haqq (‘The Truth’) from my Nourisher-Sustainer. Indeed we, we had been Muslims (even) before this","28:54":"Those will be given their reward twice because they remained patient, and they repel evil with good, and they spend out of that which We have given them as provision","28:55":"And when they listened something Laghw they avoided it and said: “To us our deeds, and to you your deeds. Peace be to you. We seek not (involvement among) the ignorants","28:56":"Verily, you: you do not guide whom you exceedingly desired, but Allah guides whom He thinks proper. And He knows better about those who have received guidance","28:57":"And they said: “If we follow Al-Hudah (The Guidance) alongwith you, we would be snatched away from our land.” So, have We not established for them Haraman Aaminan (Secure Sanctuary — City of Makka and its precincts)? Are brought to that fruits of all kinds as a provision from Ourselves, but most of them know not","28:58":"And how many a town We have destroyed, they felt proud of their economic well being. So these are their residential-suites which have not been occupied as residences after them except reluctantly. And We became: We as the inheritors","28:59":"And your Nourisher-Sustainer is not a destroyer to the habitations until He raises in their Um (the parent habitation or the mother-site) a Messenger — he reproduces unto them Ayaatina (‘Our Verses’) and We are not a destroyer to the towns except when their residents are transgressors","28:60":"And whatever you have been given in any form, so it is an enjoyment of the life of this world and its adornment, and that which is with Allah is better and more lasting.
