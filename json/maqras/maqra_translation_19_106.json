And whatever of good you spend is for (the benefit of) yourselves, when you only spend looking for God's attention (and His pleasure). And whatever of good you spend will be paid back to you (in full), and you will not be wronged"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":273,"Text":"(Charity) is for the poor who are restricted in God's way and cannot travel on the earth, but the ignorant ones assume that they are rich because of their self respect, you know them by their appearance, and they do not ask (beg) people insistently. And whatever of good you spend, indeed God knows about it"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":274,"Text":"Those who spend their wealth (in God's way) during the night and the day, secretly or openly, then they have their reward with their Master and they have no fear and no sadness"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":275,"Text":"Those who consume usury only stand (or rise) like someone who is driven to madness by Satan’s touch. This is because they said that the sale (and doing business) is like the usury, while God permitted the sale and prohibited the usury. So anyone whom an advice from his Master came to him and he stopped, then his past (profits) is his and his case is with God, and anyone who goes back (to usury), then they will be inhabitants of the fire remaining in there forever"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":276,"Text":"God destroys the usury and increases the charities. And God does not like any disbelieving sinner"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":277,"Text":"Those who believed and did good works and performed the mandatory prayer and gave the mandatory charity will have their reward with their Master and they have no fear and no sadness"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":278,"Text":"You who believe, be cautious of God and leave what is left of the usury if you are believers"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":279,"Text":"If you do not do it (stop usury), then be informed about a war from God and His messenger, and if you repent (from usury) then your principal capital is yours, you will not be wrong and you will not be wronged"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":280,"Text":"And if he (the debtor) is having difficulty (financially or otherwise) then postpone until it is easy (for him to repay), and if you are charitable (and forgive the loan) it is better for you if you knew"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":281,"Text":"And be cautious of a day when you are returned to God in it, then every person is paid back (in full) for what they earned, and they will not be wronged"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":282,"Text":"You who believe, when you borrow from each other for a limited period, then write it (to have a record). And let a writer write it (the loan details) between you in justice. A writer should not refuse to write as God taught him. So he shall write, and the borrower should dictate, and he should be cautious of God, his Master, and should not reduce (or eliminate) anything from it. And if the borrower is retarded or is a child or is unable to dictate, then his guardian should dictate in justice. And ask two witnesses from among your men to witness, and if there are not two men, then one man and two women from the witnesses who are acceptable to you, so if one of the two makes a mistake (or forgets) then the other one of the two may remind the other one. And the witnesses should not refuse (to testify) if they are called upon. And they should not be reluctant to write it no matter how small or large, along with its term. This is fairer in God’s view, and more upstanding for the testimony, and closer that you do not have doubts. Except if it is a face to face transaction that (the actual merchandise or money) changes hands between you, then there will be no blame on you if you do not write it. And take witness when you buy and sell. And the writer and the witness should not be harmed, and if you do (harm them) it is indeed disobedience on your part. And be cautious of God, and God teaches you (what to do). God knows everything"}]}
