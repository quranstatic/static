The pagans labelled the Quran as poetry and the Prophet as a poet while the difference is obviously vast. A. The Quran invites to a straight course aiming at a specific Purpose and a useful end. The Prophet's words together with his deeds accord, he does not say something today and cancels it tomorrow nor does he yield to emotions and desires but insists on a divine course of action and does not change nor deviate. On the other hand poets are captives of their emotions, their imagination and of the changing atmospheres and temperaments. When pleased they say one thing and when displeased they say another thing, whereas the Quran adheres eternally to the same thing. B. Poets may be good poets (poets of literary merit), poetic antiquarian (poet with another quality), poeticule (insignificant ), poetaster (a writer of trashy verse) a rhymester. Some of them engage in feigning and devising fables and others aim to please. C.
