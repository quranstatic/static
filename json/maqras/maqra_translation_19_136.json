God guides whomever He wills. What charity you give benefits you when you contribute only to please God. Your contributions will be paid back to you, and you will not be cheated"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":273,"Text":"Give to the poor who are wholly committed to the path of God and who are unable to travel in the land. The unaware considers them rich because of their self-restraint. You will recognize them by their character traits. They are not always asking people to help them. God knows what you contribute"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":274,"Text":"All those who contribute their money at night or during the day, both secretly and publicly, will receive a reward from their Lord. They will not be afraid, nor will they grieve"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":275,"Text":"Those who profit from usury will rise up on the Day of Resurrection like someone tormented by Satan's touch because they say, \"Selling is like usury, but God allowed selling and forbade usury.\" So whoever stops when receiving his Lord's good advice may keep what was previously his, and his matter is with God.

Let a legal clerk draw it up between you. The clerk should not refuse to write as God has taught him. The one who owes should dictate and always be mindful of God, his Lord. No amount should be withheld from him. If the one who owes is foolish, weak, or unable to dictate himself, let his legal guardian dictate and have it witnessed by two men, or, if there are not two, by one man and two women whom you approve as witnesses. If one of [the women] forgets, the other will remind her. Witnesses should not refuse when they are called upon. Do not think it unimportant to write it down, whether a small or large amount, along with its specified terms. That is more equitable to God, more reliable for testimony, and more likely to preclude doubt, except when it is a current business [that] you manage among yourselves. [In that case], not writing it down is not wrong. Always have witnesses present whenever you trade with one another, and do not let any harm be done to either the legal clerk or witnesses. If you do, you will be sinning. Be mindful of God, and God will teach you. God knows everything"}]}
