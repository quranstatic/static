We gave Da´ood the book of ´Zaboor´ (the Psalms)"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":164,"Text":"(We sent inspiration to) the messengers We have mentioned to you earlier, and (also to) the messengers We never mentioned to you. (But) with Musa, Allah spoke directly _ (not just through angels, or by inspiration)"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":165,"Text":"Messengers were the bearers of good news and (dire) warnings. After the messengers, mankind should have no pleas or pretext to offer before Allah; and Allah is the most Powerful and the Wisest"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":166,"Text":"(Skeptics may doubt), but Allah Himself testifies to (the truth of) what He has revealed to you, (Oh Muhammad, SAW). He has sent to you this revelation with His (unerring and infallible) knowledge. The angels testify (to that fact) also!

Do not (overstate and) exaggerate your religious beliefs; do not say anything except the truth about Allah. The Messiah, Jesus son of Mary was in fact (nothing more than) the messenger of Allah and His word which He cast upon Mary. (Jesus was) a soul created by Him. So, believe in Allah and His messenger. Do not say (that Allah is) three! Desist! It is better for you (if you desist). Verily, Allah is (only) One. He is (too glorified and) too exalted to have a son. Everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him. Allah suffices as a Disposer of all matters and things! (He needs no mediator)"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":172,"Text":"Never was (Jesus) the Messiah, too arrogant to be treated as the created servant of Allah, nor are the angels who are the closest (to Allah).

Say, \"Allah gives you instructions concerning the inheritance of distant relatives. If a man passes away and has no (living parent or) child, but has a sister, then she inherits half of what he leaves behind. (Similarly) he would inherit from his sister, if she was childless. If a man was survived by two sisters (and no direct heir) they both would inherit two-thirds of what he leaves behind. If the deceased had (no direct heirs, but) brothers and sisters, then the share of the male shall be equal to the share of two females. Allah clarifies matters for you, lest you go astray. Allah is very well Aware of all things"}]}
