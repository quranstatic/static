Those who horde gold and silver and do not spend (anything out of it) for the cause of God, should know that their recompense will be a painful torment"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":35,"Text":"on the Day of Judgment and that their treasures will be heated by the fire of hell and pressed against their foreheads, sides and back with this remark, \"These are your own treasures which you hoarded for yourselves. See for yourselves what they feel like"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":36,"Text":"According to the Book of God, from the day He created the heavens and the earth, the number of months are twelve, four of which are sacred. (This is part of the law) of the religion. Do not commit injustice against your souls during the sacred months but fight all the pagans just as they fight against all of you. Know that God is with the pious ones"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":37,"Text":"To disregard the observation of the sacred months and to observe it during the non-sacred months is to add more to one's disbelief. This causes the unbelievers to go further astray. One year they (the pagans) consider a sacred month not sacred, (and observe it during a non-sacred month) but the next year they consider it sacred at the right time. By dealing with the sacred months in such a manner, they think that they have observed the laws of God, but, in fact, they have changed them. Their evil deeds seem attractive to them but God does not guide the unbelieving people"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":38,"Text":"Believers, why is it that when you are told to march for the cause of God, you seem to linger at home.

When the unbelievers expelled him and he was one of the two people in the cave telling his friend, \"Do not worry; God is with us,\" then God gave him confidence and supported him with an army which you did not see and He defeated the cause of the disbelievers and made His own cause stand supreme. God is Majestic and All-wise"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":41,"Text":"Whether unarmed or well equipped, march and fight for the cause of God with your possessions and in person. This would be better for you, if only you knew it"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":42,"Text":"Had the gain been immediate or the journey shorter, they (hypocrites) would certainly have followed you, (Muhammad), but it was too far for them. They will swear by God, \"Had we had the ability, we would certainly have marched with you.\" They destroy only themselves and God knows that they are lying"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":43,"Text":"May God forgive you! (Muhammad), why did you not let them join the army so that you could discern the liars from the truthful ones"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":44,"Text":"Those who believe in God and the Day of Judgment do not ask you whether they should fight for the cause of God with their property and in person, or not.
