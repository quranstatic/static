And Allah is Mighty, Wise"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":20,"Text":"Allah had promised you many spoils that you would receive, so He gave these to you sooner, and stopped the hands of the people from (harming) you. And (He did this) so that it becomes a sign for believers, and so that He guides you to the right path"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":21,"Text":"And (there is) another (victory) that has not come within your power as yet, (but) Allah has encompassed it.

And (Allah would have allowed you to fight,) had there not been believing men and believing women whom you did not know that you might have trampled them, and thus a painful situation might have arisen for you because of them unknowingly; (This situation was avoided) so that Allah may admit to His mercy whom He wills.
