It is they who will have shackles around their necks. And it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever"},{"SurahNumber":13,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"They ask you ˹O Prophet˺ to hasten the torment rather than grace, though there have ˹already˺ been ˹many˺ torments before them. Surely your Lord is full of forgiveness for people, despite their wrongdoing, and your Lord is truly severe in punishment"},{"SurahNumber":13,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"The disbelievers say, “If only a sign could be sent down to him from his Lord.” You ˹O Prophet˺ are only a warner. And every people had a guide"},{"SurahNumber":13,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"God knows what every female bears and what increases and decreases in the wombs. And with Him everything is determined with precision"},{"SurahNumber":13,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"˹He is the˺ Knower of the seen and the unseen—the All-Great, Most Exalted"},{"SurahNumber":13,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"It is the same ˹to Him˺ whether any of you speaks secretly or openly, whether one hides in the darkness of night or goes about in broad daylight"},{"SurahNumber":13,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"For each one there are successive angels before and behind, protecting them by God’s command.

He sends thunderbolts, striking with them whoever He wills. Yet they dispute about God. And He is tremendous in might"},{"SurahNumber":13,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"Calling upon Him ˹alone˺ is the truth. But those ˹idols˺ the pagans invoke besides Him ˹can˺ never respond to them in any way. ˹It is˺ just like someone who stretches out their hands to water, ˹asking it˺ to reach their mouths, but it can never do so. The calls of the disbelievers are only in vain"},{"SurahNumber":13,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"To God ˹alone˺ bow down ˹in submission˺ all those in the heavens and the earth—willingly or unwillingly—as do their shadows, morning and evening"},{"SurahNumber":13,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"Ask ˹them, O Prophet˺, “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?” Say, “God!” Ask ˹them˺, “Why ˹then˺ have you taken besides Him lords who cannot even benefit or protect themselves?” Say, “Can the blind and the sighted be equal?

The currents then carry along rising foam, similar to the slag produced from metal that people melt in the fire for ornaments or tools. This is how God compares truth to falsehood.
