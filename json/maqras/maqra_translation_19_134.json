And whatever alms you give shall be repaid to you in full: you shall not be wronged"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":273,"Text":"As for the poor who are preoccupied with fighting in the cause of God, and cannot travel the land in quest of a livelihood: the ignorant take them for men of wealth on account of their modest behaviour. But you recognize them by their look â€• they never importune people for alms. Whatever alms you give are known to God"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":274,"Text":"Those that give alms by night and by day, in private and in public, shall be rewarded by their Lord and have nothing to fear or to regret"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":275,"Text":"Those that devour usury shall rise up before God like him that Satan has demented by his touch; for they claim that trading is no different from usury. But God has permitted trading and made usury unlawful. He that has received an admonition from his Lord and mended his ways may keep his previous gains; God will be his judge. Those that turn back shall be the inmates of the Fire, wherein they shall abide for ever"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":276,"Text":"God has laid His curse on usury and blessed almsgiving with increase.

None shall be wronged"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":282,"Text":"Believers, when you contract a debt for a fixed period, put it in writing. Let a scribe write it down for you with fairness; no scribe should refuse to write as God has taught him. Therefore let him write; and let the debtor dictate, fearing God his Lord and not diminishing the sum he owes. If the debtor be an ignorant or feeble-minded person, or one who cannot dictate, let his guardian dictate for him in fairness. Call in two male witnesses from among you, but if two men cannot be found, then one man and two women whom you judge fit to act as witnesses; so that if either of them make an error, the other will remind her. Witnesses shall not refuse if called upon to give evidence. So do not fail to put your debts in writing, be they small or large, together with the date of payment. This is more just in the sight of God; it ensures accuracy in testifying and is the best way to remove all doubt. But if the transaction be a bargain concluded on the spot, it is no offence for you if you do not put it into writing. See that witnesses are present when you barter with one another, and let no harm be done to either scribe or witness. If you harm them you will commit a transgression. Have fear of God; God teaches you, and God has knowledge of all things"}]}
