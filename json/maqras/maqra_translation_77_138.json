A great many religious leaders, rabbis, priests, monks, mullahs, yogis, and mystics devour the wealth of mankind in falsehood, and debar them from the Path of Allah. All those who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in the Cause of Allah, to them give tidings (O Prophet) of a painful doom"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":35,"Text":"On the Day when it will all be heated in the fire of Hell and their foreheads, flanks and backs will be branded with it. \"Here is what you hoarded for yourselves, now taste what you had hoarded"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":36,"Text":"Allah has ordained twelve months in one year. This has been Allah's Ordinance since the day He created the heavens and the earth. Four of these Months are Sacred, forbidden for all warfare. (Mankind, through international treaties, must agree to shun all kind of warfare during these four months. This will give them a cooling off period that sense may prevail over emotions). This is the Firm Religion, the right way. So, do not wrong yourselves by fighting during the Sacred Months. However, you may fight the idolaters in any or all these months if they fight against you in any or all of them (2:194). And know that Allah is with those who restrain themselves.

When the disbelievers drove him out of his home, they were just two men. They had to seek refuge in a cave. The Messenger said to his companion, \"Grieve not. Surely, Allah is with us.\" Then Allah sent His reassuring peace upon him, and supported him with invisible forces of faith and courage (9:26). He made the word of the disbelievers utterly low.
