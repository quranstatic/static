And the wealth, you spend, shall be recompensed to you, and you will not be wronged"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":273,"Text":"For those needy people, confined to Allah's Path, unable to move about in the land, and whom the ignorant do not consider to be poor because of the abstinence. You recognize them by their looks. They do not ask for things from people persistently. And Allah indeed becomes instantly aware of anything you spend"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":274,"Text":"For those who spend their wealth, by night and by day, secretly and openly, their reward is with their Lord. And there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":275,"Text":"Those who consume Ar-Riba live not but like those whom Satan makes to stumble on in life, under his spell. That is because they assert, \"Business is just like Ar-Riba.h\" And Allah has made business lawful and Ar-riba unlawful. He, then, to whom admonition has come from his Lord and has since abstained from Ar-Riba — to him belongs what happened in the past. And to Allah returns his deed.And those who rebel — they shall be inhabitants of the Hell-fire, therein to remain forever"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":276,"Text":"Allah withdraws His blessings from Ar-Riba and causes prosperity in Suadaquaat.

Then, every one shall be repaid in full what one earned. And they shall not be wronged"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":282,"Text":"O you who believe! When you contract a loan among yourselves for a certain period, put it down in writing. And a scribe ought to record it faithfully between you. And the scribe should not refuse to write; as Allah has taught him, so he should write.And the one, upon whom lies the liability, should dictate. And he should fear Allah, his Lord, and omit nothing. Then if the one, upon whom lies the liability, is mentally unsound or weak or is himself unable to dictate, let his guardian dictate for him fairly. And two of you men should bear witness. If two men are not available, then one man and two women, you choose from among those present, should bear witness, so that if one of the women retracts, the other stands by her evidence. And the witnesses must not refuse when they are called to witness. Be not weary of writing a term contract, small or big. With Allah, that's a proper thing to do for better establishment of evidence and for removal of your doubts, unless it be a hand-to-hand commercial transaction commonly done among yourselves, in which case there is no blame on you if you do not put it in writing. And keep witnesses when you do any business. And cause no harm to the scribe, or to the witnesses. And if you do so, it would indeed be wickedness on your part. And fear Allah. And Allah teaches you.And Allah knows everything"}]}
