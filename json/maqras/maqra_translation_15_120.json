{"Id":120,"LanguageCodes":["en","eng"],"Name":"eng-maududi","Author":"Maududi","Language":"English","Description":"English","Direction":"ltr","Source":"","Translations":[{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":233,"Text":"The (divorced) mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years, if the fathers desire the suckling to be completed. In that case the father of the child shall, in the fair known way, be responsible for their food and clothing. But none should be burdened with more than one can bear: neither the mother should be pressed unjustly (to accept unfair terms) just because she is the mother nor should the father be burdened just because he is the father. And the same responsibility for the maintenance of the mother devolves upon the father of the child and his heir. There is no harm if they wean the child by mutual consent and consultation. Moreover, there is no harm if you choose to give your children a suckle by a wet nurse, provided that you pay her fairly. Fear Allah and know it well that whatever you do is in the sight of Allah"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":234,"Text":"If those of you, who die, leave wives behind, they should abstain (from marriage) for four months and ten days. Then when their waiting term expires, they are free to do whatever they choose for themselves, provided that it is decent; you shall not be answerable for this; Allah is fully aware of what you do"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":235,"Text":"It is no offence if you make indirect proposal of marriage to widows during their waiting term or keep it concealed in your hearts: for Allah knows that you will naturally think of them. But be careful not to make any secret engagement. If you have to do anything, do it in an honourable way. And you should not settle anything finally about the marriage until the waiting term expires. Understand it well that Allah even knows what is hidden in your hearts; so fear Him. Also know that Allah is Lenient and Forgiving"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":236,"Text":"It is no sin if you divorce your wives while you have not yet touched them or fixed any dower for them. In such a case, pay them something anyhow. A rich man should pay fairly according to his means and a poor man according to his resources, for this is an obligation on the righteous people"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":237,"Text":"In case you fixed a dower for them and then divorced them before you touched them, you should pay half of the fixed dower. But there is no harm if the woman agrees to forego it or the man, in whose hands is the marriage tie, is generous enough (to pay the dower in full). And if you (men) act generously, it is akin to piety. Do not forget to show generosity in your dealings with one another for Allah sees what you do"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":238,"Text":"Take great care of your Prayers, especially of a Prayer that has excellent qualities of Salat and stand before Allah like devoted servants"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":239,"Text":"Even if you are in danger, you must offer your Prayers anyhow on foot or on horseback. And when you have peace again, remember Allah in the manner He has taught you, which you did not know before"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":240,"Text":"Those of you, who shall die and leave wives behind them, should make a will to the effect that they should be provided with a yearÂ´s maintenance and should not be turned out of their homes. But if they leave their homes of their own accord, you shall not be answerable for whatever they choose for themselves in a fair way; Allah is All-Powerful, All-Wise"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":241,"Text":"Likewise, the divorced women should also be given something in accordance with the known fair standard. This is an obligation upon the God-fearing people"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":242,"Text":"Thus Allah makes clear His commandments for you: it is expected that you will use your common sense"}]}
