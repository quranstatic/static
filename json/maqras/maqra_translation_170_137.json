Enter not the Prophet's houses, unless permission is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation.

Verily, such (behavior) annoys the Prophet, and he is shy of (asking) you (to go); but Allah is not shy of (telling you) the truth. And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts.
