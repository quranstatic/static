There and then were they stamped with humiliation and misery and came within the measure of Allah's wrath. This was in the train of their denial of Allah's revelations and signs demonstrating Omnipotence and Authority and of bringing death unjustifiably upon the Prophets of their own nation. Such vices were a sequel to the disobedience natural to them that it drew after it their addiction to transgression"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":62,"Text":"Nonetheless, those who are disposed to believe in the Prophets who dated far back into the past, and those who profess Judaism and the Christians, the various sects of the Sabeites or Mendaites and of the Sabians, and those who fall in line with the Prophet Muhammad, whoever believes in Allah, His Oneness, Uniqueness, Sameness, Omnipotence, Omnipresence and Ultimate Authority and acknowledges the truth of Resurrection and Judgment and whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety, shall Heaven reward them all for their homage thereto.
