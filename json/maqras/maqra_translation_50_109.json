(Practice as you are admonished to practice, and) do not ask about things which, if made manifest to you, would give you trouble (and make the practice of religion difficult for you).

(Do not busy yourselves with those who follow different ways!) Your responsibility is your selves (so consider how you are faring along your own way).
