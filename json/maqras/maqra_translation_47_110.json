And he who favours their tutelage shall be counted as one of them; Allah does not guide the wrongful to His path of righteousness"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":52,"Text":"And you see those hypocrites whose ill-natured hearts reflect the morbidity inherent in their innermost being, hasten on to win their tutelage and they interpret their thoughts in words, Thus: \"We fear,\" they say, \"lest one day fortune be on their side and we should be overcome and suffer at their hands\". May Allah make victory sit on your helm O Muslims or take matters of fact and circumstance them after His own manner; there and then shall the hypocrites be really sorry and pained at heart for having succumbed to their evil thoughts"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":53,"Text":"And there and then shall say those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand to Ahl AL-Kitab: \"Are these -the hypocrites- not the people who swore fealty to you\". Now have their hopes been doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness; they have come to be great losers"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"O you who have conformed to Islam : He who turns renegade and deserts Islam in favour of another religion shall not frustrate the laws nor the statutes of heaven's realm; Allah shall replace them by people whom He favours and who lift to Him their inward sight; they are humble and meek with their co - religionists and proud - hearted hauty severe toward the infidels; they strive in the cause of Allah not caring what people say.

It is incumbent on you to deny their tutelage. They mock your religion and amuse themselves with its principles. You just entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":58,"Text":"And when you call to prayer, they mockingly mimic and deride the act of worship and amuse themselves with what they hear and see. This is because they are a people who lack the faculty of comprehending intellectually"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":59,"Text":"Ask them O Muhammad: you Ahl AL-Kitab, do you have this vindictive disposition against us only because we believe in Allah and in the Quran revealed to us and in the Scriptures revealed aforetime! \"The fact is that most of you are wicked"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":60,"Text":"Say to them: \"Shall I inform you of what is worse: you stir yourselves against your kind, and worse against yourselves, and far worse is that you have come within the measure of Allah’s wrath\". Accordingly, Allah had decreed they be monkyfied and vested with swinish disposition and their monkey and swine-like character and behaviour be viewed with contempt and they be despised and rejected of men and be worshippers of idols. These and such persons have indeed assumed the worst position in society here and Hereafter and strayed far away from the path of righteousness"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":61,"Text":"When they pay you a visit, be it sociable or in other manner, they declare they have conformed to Islam, when in fact they have come in with minds captivated by infidelity and hostile intentions and come out with the same attributes, and Allah is 'Alimun of what they concealed of private thoughts and feelings"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":62,"Text":"And you see many of them hasten on to commit themselves to an evil line of conduct and to transgression, not to mention their hunger for ill-gotten gain.

Close-fisted be their hands and cursed they are for their evil thoughts expressed in words, but He is open-handed; He yields abundantly as He will and how He will. And the more Allah bestows on you O Muhammad of His bounty, the more do many of them err for infirmity of purpose, and display their transgressive infirmities of themselves and sink deeper in infidelity under the vexations of their minds. And We stirred up enmity and hatred among them -the Christians among themselves and between the Christians and the Jews till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they inflame passion for kindling a war against you Muhammad, Allah extinguishes their reason and their alacrity. They strive to spread mischief and create discord on earth, and Allah detests those characterized with prepensed malice"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":65,"Text":"Had Ahl al-Kitab conformed to Allah’s will and acknowledged the mission of His Messenger and -the Quran- sent down to him, and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, We would have dropped the charges against them and cancelled their misfortunes and admitted them to the gardens of bliss and beatitude"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":66,"Text":"And had they adhered to the precepts of AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil and complied with all that was revealed to them from Allah, their Creator, He would have made all grace abound in them, spiritually from the realm above them and materially from the earth beneath their feet. Among them are a people who lift to Allah their inward sight and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety, but many of them are wrongful of actions; evil indeed is what they do"}]}
