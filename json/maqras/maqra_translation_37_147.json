Do you seek to guide those whom God allows to go astray? You cannot guide those whom God allows to go astray"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":89,"Text":"They want you to deny the Truth, so that you may become all alike. Do not take them as your allies until they emigrate in the way of God. If they turn back (to enmity), seize them and kill them wherever you may find them; and take no friend or helper from among them"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":90,"Text":"But make an exception of those who seek refuge with people with whom you have a treaty, or who come over to you because their hearts forbid them to fight against you or against their own people. Had God pleased, He would have given them power over you, so that they would have taken up arms against you. Therefore, if they keep away from you and cease their hostility and propose peace to you, God does not allow you to harm them"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":91,"Text":"You will find others who wish to be safe from you, and from their own people, yet whenever they find an opportunity of inflicting harm, they plunge into it. So if they neither withdraw, nor offer you peace, nor restrain themselves from fighting you, seize and kill them wherever you encounter them. Over such people We have given you clear authority"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":92,"Text":"No believer should kill another believer, unless it be by mistake. Anyone who kills a believer by mistake should free a believing slave and pay blood money to the victim's relatives unless they forego it as an act of charity. If the victim belongs to a people at war with you, but is a believer, then the compensation is to free a believing slave. If he belongs to a people with whom you have a treaty, then blood-money should be handed over to his relatives and a believing slave set free. Anyone who lacks the means must fast for two consecutive months. Such is the penance imposed by God. God is all knowing and wise"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":93,"Text":"If anyone kills a believer deliberately, his reward shall be eternal Hell. God will condemn him and reject him, and prepare for him a terrible punishment"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":94,"Text":"Believers, when you go forth in the cause of God, make due investigation and do not say to those who offer you the greeting of peace, \"You are no believer!\" because you seek the good things of this life. With God there are good things in plenty. You yourself were in the same position before, but God conferred His special favour on you. Therefore, take care to investigate. Surely God is well-aware of what you do"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":95,"Text":"Those believers who stay behind, apart from those forced by necessity, are not equal to those who strive hard in God's cause with their possessions and their persons.

God has promised all a good reward; but far greater is the recompense of those who strive for Him"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":96,"Text":"high ranks conferred by Him as well as forgiveness and mercy. God is forgiving and merciful"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":97,"Text":"When the angels take the souls of those who have wronged themselves, they will ask, \"What was wrong with you?\" They will answer, \"We were too weak on earth.\" The angels will say, \"Was God's earth not spacious enough for you to have migrated to some other place?\" These are the ones whose abode shall be Hell, an evil destination"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":98,"Text":"except such weak ones among men, women and children, as are incapable of adopting any plan or of finding any way out"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":99,"Text":"God may well pardon them.
