Fear your Lord! Indeed, the jolt of that hour (of Judgment) is a terrible thing"},{"SurahNumber":22,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"On that day _ (the Day of Judgment) _ you will see every breast feeding mother oblivious of her suckling infant!

Some of you die young while others are diverted to the age of weakness (and senility) _ the age when (once again) they know nothing after having learnt a few things.

They lose out in this world, and also in the next! That, surely is a real loss"},{"SurahNumber":22,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"Instead of Allah, they pray to such deities that can inflict no harm, and award no benefits.
