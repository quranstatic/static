God chooses whom He wills and brings them together (in faith and in obedience) to Himself, and He guides to Himself whoever turns to Him in devotion"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"And they (who follow the previous Ways) were not divided (into opposing groups) until after the knowledge came to them (of the way they must follow and what that entailed, and only) because of envious rivalry and insolence among themselves. Had it not been for a decree already issued by your Lord, (granting people respite and postponing the final, decisive judgment) until an appointed term, it would indeed have been judged between them. Surely those who (succeeded those opposing groups and) inherited the Book, are in doubting uncertainty about it"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"So (O Messenger) call people to that (the way of life God has laid down for you). Pursue what is exactly right (in every matter) as you are commanded (by God). Do not follow their desires and caprices (who follow other ways, including the followers of the previous Scriptures), and say: \"I believe in whatever Book God has sent down; and I am commanded to bring about equity among you (without discrimination of race or rank by birth or by wealth or by power). God is our Lord and your Lord. To us are accounted our deeds, and to you, your deeds: (let there be) no contention between us and you: God will bring us all together (and settle any difference between us and you). To Him is the homecoming"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"And as for those who contend about God (defying His Lordship or struggling against His Religion) after His call has been accepted (and His Religion recognized as true), their contention is void in their Lord’s sight, and (His) wrath (condemnation) is upon them, and for them is a severe punishment"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":17,"Text":"God is He Who has sent down the Book with truth and the Balance, (setting out the truth and what is right in all matters). And for all you know, the Last Hour may well be near"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":18,"Text":"Those who do not believe in it (derisively) ask it to be hastened; whereas those who believe hold it in awe, and know that it is true (certain to come). Be aware! those who dispute concerning the Last Hour have indeed gone far astray"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":19,"Text":"God is All-Gracious to His servants. He grants provision to whom He wills (in the manner and degree that He wills); and He is the All-Strong, the All-Glorious with irresistible might"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":20,"Text":"Whoever desires (and strives to gain) the harvest of the Hereafter, We increase him in his harvest; and whoever desires the harvest of the world, We grant him out of that, and he has no portion in the Hereafter"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":21,"Text":"Or do they have partners with God who have prescribed for them in the Religion what God has not allowed (and so they judge and act however they wish)? Had it not been for a decree (already issued by God, postponing the final, decisive judgment) between people, it would indeed have been judged between them. Surely for the wrongdoers there is a painful punishment"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":22,"Text":"You will see the wrongdoers (who presume to lay down a way of life in the name of religion other than God’s) full of fear on account of what they have earned, and it will inevitably befall them. As for those who believe and do good, righteous deeds, they will be in the luxuriant meadows of the Gardens. They will have whatever they wish prepared in God’s Presence. That indeed is the great favor"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":23,"Text":"That it is of which God gives the glad tidings to His servants who believe and do good, righteous deeds. Say: \"I ask of you no wage for it (for conveying God’s Religion to you which will bring you this favor), but (I ask of you for) love for my near relatives (on account of my mission).\" Whoever scores a good deed, We increase him in good in respect of it. Surely God is All-Forgiving, All-Responsive (to gratitude)"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":24,"Text":"What? Do they say that he (the Messenger) has fabricated a falsehood in attribution to God? If He so wills, He can seal up your heart (so you would not be able to recite to them anything of Revelation. But what you convey to them is the Revelations from Us.) And God blots out falsehood and affirms the truth to be true by His decrees. Surely, God has full knowledge of what lies hidden in the bosoms"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":25,"Text":"He is the One Who accepts repentance from His servants and excuses evil deeds, and He knows all that you do"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":26,"Text":"He responds with acceptance to (the worship and supplication of) those who believe and do good, righteous deeds, and grants them more out of His bounty (than they asked for).
