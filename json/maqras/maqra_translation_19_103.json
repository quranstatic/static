Whatever good you give away is to your own benefit, when you give desiring only the Face of Allah. Whatever good you give away will be repaid to you in full. You will not be wronged"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":273,"Text":"It is for the poor who are held back in the Way of Allah, unable to travel in the land. The ignorant consider them rich because of their reticence. You will know them by their mark. They do not ask from people insistently. Whatever good you give away, Allah knows it"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":274,"Text":"Those who give away their wealth by night and day, secretly and openly, will have their reward with their Lord. They will feel no fear and will know no sorrow"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":275,"Text":"Those who practise usury will not rise from the grave except as someone driven mad by Shaytan´s touch. That is because they say, ´Trade is the same as usury.´ But Allah has permitted trade and He has forbidden usury. Whoever is given a warning by his Lord and then desists, may keep what he received in the past and his affair is Allah´s concern. But all who return to it will be the Companions of the Fire, remaining in it timelessly, for ever"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":276,"Text":"Allah obliterates usury but makes sadaqa grow in value!

Then every self will be paid in full for what it earned. They will not be wronged"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":282,"Text":"You who have iman! when you take on a debt for a specified period, write it down. A writer should write it down between you justly. No writer should refuse to write; as Allah has taught him, so he should write. The one incurring the debt should dictate and should have taqwa of Allah his Lord and not reduce it in any way. If the person incurring the debt is incompetent or weak or unable to dictate, then his guardian should dictate for him justly. Two men among you should act as witnesses. But if there are not two men, then a man and two women with whom you are satisfied as witnesses; then if one of them forgets, the other can remind her. Witnesses should not refuse when they are called upon. Do not think it too trivial to write down, whether small or large, with the date that it falls due. Doing that is more just in Allah´s sight and more helpful when bearing witness and more likely to eliminate any doubt — unless it is an immediate transaction hand to hand, taken and given without delay. There is nothing wrong in your not writing that down. Call witnesses when you trade. Neither writer nor witness should be put under pressure. If you do that, it is deviancy on your part. Have taqwa of Allah and Allah will give you knowledge. Allah has knowledge of all things"}]}
