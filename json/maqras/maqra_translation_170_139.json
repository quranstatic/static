This is better for (their peace of mind), the cooling of eyAes (in the joy of seeing you), to keep off their sorrow, and for their satisfaction— That all of them (are happy) with what you have to give to them: And Allah knows (all) that is in your hearts: And Allah is All Knowing (Aleem), Most Forbearing (Haleem)"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":52,"Text":"(O Prophet!) It is not lawful for you (to marry more) women after this, or to change them for (other) wives, even though their beauty may attract you, except any (women whom) your right hand should possess (as handmaidens): And Allah is Watchful (Raqib) over all things"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":53,"Text":"O you who believe! Do not enter the Prophet’s houses— Unless permission is given to you— (If you go) for a meal, do not be (so early as) to wait for its preparation: But when you are invited, enter (his house); And when you have taken your meal, go away, without trying to get into idle talk. Verily, such (behavior) does not please the Prophet: And he is (too) shy to ask you to leave, but Allah is not shy (to tell you) the truth. And when you ask (his ladies) for anything you may want, ask them with a screen between (them and you): That allows greater purity in your hearts and theirs. And it is not right for you that you may displease Allah’s Messenger (Muhammad), nor that you may marry his widows after him (after his death at any time). Truly, in Allah’s sight, such a thing is an enormous and evil act"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Whether you openly say anything or hide it, surely, Allah is All Knowing (Aleem) of all things"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"There is no sin (on the women when they go) before their fathers, or their sons, their brothers, or their brothers’ sons, or their sisters’ sons, or their (believing) women, or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess.

Tell your wives and your daughters, and the believing women, that they should wear their outer clothes over their bodies (when outside): That is most suitable (and appropriate), so that they should be known (as believing women) and not be annoyed (or attacked).
