Eat of their fruits when they come to fruition, and give (to the poor and the needy) the due thereof on harvest day. And do not be wasteful (by over-eating or other unnecessary consumption, or by giving to others so much as to leave in need those whose maintenance is your responsibility); indeed He does not love the wasteful"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":142,"Text":"And of the cattle (He has created) some for carrying loads, and some for the sake of their flesh, and skins and fur. Consume from what God has provided for you as sustenance, and do not follow in the footsteps of Satan (by laying down rules other than those of God and adopting ways other than God’s); surely he is a manifest enemy to you"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":143,"Text":"Eight in pairs of cattle: two of sheep, two of goats. Say (to them, O Messenger): \"Is it the two males that God has made unlawful or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females may contain? Inform me about this with sound, authoritative knowledge, if you are truthful (in your claim that God has made them unlawful)"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":144,"Text":"And likewise of camels there are two, and of oxen there are two. Say: \"Is it the two males that God has made unlawful or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females may contain? Or were you present there to witness when God laid down this (the commandment you attribute to Him) for you?\" Who is more in wrong than he who fabricates falsehood in attribution to God, and thus leads people astray without sound, authoritative knowledge? Indeed, God does not guide wrongdoing people (to the truth and the attainment of their goals)"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":145,"Text":"Say (O Messenger): \"I do not find in what has been revealed to me anything made unlawful to one who would eat except it be carrion or blood outpoured (not that which is left in the veins of such organs as the liver and spleen), or the flesh of swine, which is loathsome and unclean, or that which is profane having been slaughtered in the name of other than God (or without pronouncing God’s Name over it). Yet whoever is constrained by dire necessity (to eat thereof) provided he does not covet nor exceed (the bounds of the necessity): (no sin shall be on him). Your Lord is indeed All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":146,"Text":"And for those who are Jews We have made unlawful all beasts with claws, and of oxen and sheep We have made unlawful for them their fat, save that which is in their backs or entrails, or that which is mixed with the bone.
