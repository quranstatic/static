Let them not dishearten theeâ€”those who compete with one another in ingratitude among those who said: We believed with their mouths while their hearts believe not. ^And among those who became Jews^ are ones who hearken to lies, ones who hearken to folk of others who approach not thee. They tamper with the words out of context. They say: If you were given this, then, take it, but if you are not given this, then, beware! And for whomever God wants to test, thou wilt never have sway over him against God at all. Those are whom God wants not to purify their hearts. For them in the present is degradation. And for them in the world to come is a tremendous punishment"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":42,"Text":"They are ones who hearken to lies, the ones who devour the wrongful.

The Prophets give judgment with it, those who submitted to God, for those who became Jews and the rabbis and learned Jewish scholars who committed to memory the Book of God and they had been witnesses to it. So dread not humanity, but dread Me. And exchange not My signs for a little price.

So give judgment between them by what God caused to descend. And follow not their desires that drew near thee against The Truth. For each among you We made a divine law and an open road. And if God willed, He would have made you one community to try you with what He gave you so be forward in good deeds. To God is your return altogether.
