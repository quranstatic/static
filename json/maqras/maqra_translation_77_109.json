Many among the rabbis and monks do indeed consume the wealth of people in legally invalid, wrongful ways (such as changing the Book’s commandments in return for worldly benefit, bribery, and using religion as a means of worldly gain) and bar them from God’s way. Those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend it in God’s cause (to exalt His cause and help the poor and needy): give them (O Messenger) the glad tidings of a painful punishment"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":35,"Text":"On that day, it (that hoarded wealth) will be heated in the fire of Hell and therewith their foreheads and their sides and their backs will be branded (and they will hear): \"This is the treasure which you hoarded up for yourselves; taste now what you were busy hoarding"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":36,"Text":"The number of the months, in God’s sight, is twelve as determined and decreed by God on the day when He created the heavens and the earth (and set them moving in the present conditions). Four of them are sacred (in that fighting is forbidden during them). This is the upright, ever-true Religion (the order that God has established for the operation of the universe and life of humanity). Do not, therefore, wrong yourselves with respect to these months. Nevertheless, fight all together against those who associate partners with God just as they fight against you all together; and know well that God is with the God-revering, pious who keep their duties to Him"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":37,"Text":"The postponement of a sacred month, and therefore making changes (for such aims as to make fighting in the Sacred Months lawful and cause the season of the Pilgrimage to fall in the period of the year they wish) is but an increase in unbelief (for it means making the unlawful lawful and changing the nature of many lawful and unlawful acts done in those months and therefore recognizing no law). By doing so, those who disbelieve are (further) misled, declaring it (the month they postpone) permitted in one year and forbidden in another, in order that they may conform to the number of the months that God has declared as sacred, (without caring) that they thereby make lawful what God has made unlawful. The evil of their deeds is decked out to be appealing to them. God does not guide the disbelieving people (to truth and to the attainment of their aims)"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":38,"Text":"O you who believe! What excuse do you have that when it is said to you: \"Mobilize (for the campaign of Tabuk) in God’s cause!\" you cling heavily to the earth? Are you content with the present, worldly life, rather than the Hereafter? Yet slight is the enjoyment of the worldly life as compared with the Hereafter"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":39,"Text":"If you do not mobilize (as you are commanded), He will punish you grievously, and instead of you He will substitute another people, and you will in no way harm Him. God has full power over everything"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":40,"Text":"If you do not help him (the Messenger), yet for certain God helped him when those who disbelieve drove him out (of his home during the Hijrah), the second of the two when they were in the cave (with those in pursuit of them having reached the mouth of the cave), and he said to his companion (with utmost trust in God and no worry at all): \"Do not grieve. God is surely with us.\" Then God sent down His gift of inner peace and reassurance on him, supported him with hosts you cannot see, and brought the word (the cause) of the unbelievers utterly low. And God’s word (His cause) is (always and inherently) supreme. God is All-Glorious with irresistible might, All-Wise"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":41,"Text":"Mobilize whether you are equipped lightly or heavily (and whether it be easy or difficult for you); and strive with your wealth and persons in God’s cause. Doing so is what is for your good, if you but know it"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":42,"Text":"Had there been an immediate gain, and an easy journey, those (who stayed behind because of hypocrisy) would surely have followed you, but the difficult journey was too distant for them. Yet they will swear by God: \"If only we had been able to, we would surely have gone forth with you.\" They destroy their own selves, for God knows that they are truly liars"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":43,"Text":"May God give you grace! Why did you give them leave to stay behind until it became clear to you who was speaking the truth and you came to know the liars"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":44,"Text":"Those who believe in God and the Last Day do not ask you for leave to be excused from striving in God’s cause with their wealth and persons. God has full knowledge of the God-revering, pious who keep their duty to Him"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":45,"Text":"Only they ask you for leave who do not truly believe in God and the Last Day and whose hearts are doubting, so that in their doubting they waver between one thing and another"}]}
