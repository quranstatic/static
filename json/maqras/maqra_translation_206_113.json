Do not place yourself ahead of Allah, and His messenger. Fear Allah! Indeed Allah hears all and knows all"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Oh you who believe! Do not raise your voice, (or stress your views), over that of the prophet.

Let not one ethnic group ridicule another ethnic group. It may just be that those being mocked are actually better. Similarly, do not let (some) women deride other women, because the women being laughed at, may happen to be better. Do not defame or slander each other. Do not yell (racial, ethnic or other) slurs and epithets at each other. After entering faith, it is not right to insult others with disdainful names.

Some suspicions are, in fact, outright sins. Do not engage in (unwarranted) curiosity; and do not speak ill of others behind their back. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother?
