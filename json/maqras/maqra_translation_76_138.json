Verily, with Allah is immense Reward"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":23,"Text":"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Even if your parents and siblings take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith, take not them as allies. Whoever does that, does wrong to himself.

This is the Promise of Allah who is Knower, Wise"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":29,"Text":"Fight against those who reject belief in Allah and the Last Day, and hold not Sacred what Allah and His Messenger have declared Sacred, nor acknowledge the Divine System, among those who received the Scripture, until they pay JIZYA, the tax, with willing submission, and feel themselves subjects of the State as law-abiding citizens. (As citizens of the State they must pay taxes, as the Muslims contribute toward the Just Economic Order of Zakat. In return, the State will guarantee them internal and external security, and equal rights of citizenship. JIZYA will always be less than Zakat, and will be payable only by the able-bodied Non-Muslim citizens of the State.

And they take as their Lord, the Messiah son of Mary. Yet they were commanded to worship but One God. There is no god but He. Praise and Glory to Him, He is far too Glorious for what they ascribe to Him. (*Talmud shows the Jewish superstition of ascribing divinity to Ezra, rabbis, saints, doctors of law and learned men. And the doctrine of Papal infallibility, divinity of saints and praying to them are common in the Roman Catholic Church)"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":32,"Text":"They seek to extinguish Allah's Light (the Qur'an) by their utterances (61:8).
