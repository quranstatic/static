We had granted him such riches that his treasure-chests alone would have been a burden for a body of strong men ('miftah = key. 'maftah = chest under lock and key). Behold, his people said to him, \"Exult not, for Allah does not love those who exult (in riches).\" (Korah, a cousin of Moses, was the chief slave driver for Pharaoh, and for his wealth and advisory position he was next in power only to Pharaoh, and equal to Haman.

Merit in the Sight of Allah is far better for anyone who believes and works for equity among people.
