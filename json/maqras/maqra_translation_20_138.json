If one is trusted in this manner, he shall return the collateral or the bond when due, and be mindful of Allah, his Lord. Do not withhold any testimony by concealing what you have witnessed. Anyone who withholds a testimony is noxious to his own sensitivity. Allah is Aware of all your actions"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":284,"Text":"To Allah belong all things in the heavens and all things in the earth. Whether you reveal or conceal your intentions and actions, Allah will bring you to account for them. He has appointed Laws of forgiveness and retribution. Allah has Power over all things and events and He has appointed due measure for everything"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":285,"Text":"The Messenger has full Conviction in what is revealed unto him from his Lord and so do the believers. Each one has full conviction in Allah, His angels, His Scriptures and His Messengers. They say, \"We make no distinction between any of His Messengers\" (since they were one in Purpose). And they say, \"We hear and we obey, so grant us the protection of forgiveness, our Lord. We journey through life on Your Way"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":286,"Text":"Allah tasks not and expects not from anyone more than his capacity. Any challenges that come your way, afford you a chance to expand your \"Self\". For the \"Self\" is what it earns and against it is only what it deserves. Pray, \"Our Lord! Take us not to task if we forget or miss the mark! Our Lord! Do not place a burden on us as you did place on those before us. Our Lord! Impose not on us what we have not the strength to bear!

There is no god but He. He is the Almighty, the Wise.

He it is Who has revealed to you (O Prophet) the Scripture. In it some verses are Literal, while some verses are Allegorical. The verses that pertain to Permanent Values have been presented literally. These verses, MUHKAMAT, are the Essence of the Divine Law. On the other hand, abstract phenomena, historical events, and the World of the Unseen are described in similes, metaphors and allegories for your understanding (MUTASHABIHAT). But those who are given to crookedness in their hearts pursue the allegories and try to give them literal meanings, thus creating dissension. None knows their final meaning (of such as the Essence of God, His Throne, His Book of Decree, the Eternity) but Allah. Those who are well founded in knowledge understand why the allegories have been used and they keep drawing lessons from them (74:31). They proclaim the belief that the entire Book is from their Lord. As the human knowledge evolves, many of the other allegories will unfold their literal meaning (41:53). But only the men and women of understanding will bear this fact in mind. (Each of the verses in the Qur'an is MUHKAM, Absolute Truth and you can understand which ones are to be taken literally and which ones are to be taken allegorically, by the context (11:1), (47:20). And each verse in the Book complements the other"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"They say, \"Our Lord!

They will be fuel for the Fire"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Like Pharaoh's people and the ones before them, these people reject Our Revelations, and so Allah will seize them for their trailing behind in humanity. Allah's Law of Requital is strong in pursuing and grasping"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"(O Messenger) Say to the rejecters, \"Soon you shall be overcome and then will be gathered together to Hell, a miserable bed to lie on"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"(Only recently at Badr), there was a Sign for you in the two armies that met in combat. One was fighting in the Cause of Allah, the other denying Him. With their own eyes the two armies saw each other as twice their number. (The believers in their motivation saw the manifold enemy just twice their own numbers, while the deniers saw the smaller opponents twice the size they actually were). But Allah strengthens people with His support according to His Laws. (Allah helps those who help themselves). This must be a lesson for people of vision for all times"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"Beautiful for mankind is love of the joys that come from women and children, and heaps of gold and silver, and branded horses, and cattle and well-tilled land.
