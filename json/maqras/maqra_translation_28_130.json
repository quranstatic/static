There did Allah give you one distress after another by way of requital to teach you not to grieve for that which had escaped you, nor for that which had befallen you. And Allah is Well-Aware of all that you do"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":154,"Text":"Then after the distress, He sent down security for you. Slumber overtook a party of you, while another party was thinking about themselves (as how to save their ownselves, ignoring the others and the Prophet SAW) and thought wrongly of Allah - the thought of ignorance. They said, \"Have we any part in the affair?\" Say you (O Muhammad SAW): \"Indeed the affair belongs wholly to Allah.\" They hide within themselves what they dare not reveal to you, saying: \"If we had anything to do with the affair, none of us would have been killed here.\" Say: \"Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death,\" but that Allah might test what is in your breasts; and to Mahis that which was in your hearts (sins), and Allah is All-Knower of what is in (your) breasts"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":155,"Text":"Those of you who turned back on the day the two hosts met (i.e. the battle of Uhud), it was Shaitan (Satan) who caused them to backslide (run away from the battlefield) because of some (sins) they had earned.

Be not like those who disbelieve (hypocrites) and who say to their brethren when they travel through the earth or go out to fight: \"If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed,\" so that Allah may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. It is Allah that gives life and causes death. And Allah is All-Seer of what you do"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":157,"Text":"And if you are killed or die in the Way of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from Allah are far better than all that they amass (of worldly wealths, etc)"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":158,"Text":"And whether you die, or are killed, verily, unto Allah you shall be gathered"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":159,"Text":"And by the Mercy of Allah, you dealt with them gently. And had you been severe and harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about you; so pass over (their faults), and ask (Allah's) Forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affairs. Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allah, certainly, Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him)"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":160,"Text":"If Allah helps you, none can overcome you; and if He forsakes you, who is there after Him that can help you?
