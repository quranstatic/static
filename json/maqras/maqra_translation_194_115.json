Allah chooses for His service whom He wills, and guides to His Way only those who turn to Him in repentance"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"The people did not become divided into sects until after knowledge had come to them out of envy among themselves. Had your Lord not issued the word to defer their punishment till an appointed time, the matter would have already been settled between them. The fact is that those who were made to inherit the Book after them, are surely in disquieting doubt concerning it"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Therefore, call them to the true Deen, stay firm on the Right Way as you are commanded and do not follow their vain desires. Tell them: \"I believe in whatever Allah has revealed from the Book and I am commanded to do justice between you. Allah is Our Lord and your Lord. We are responsible for Our deeds and you for yours. Let there be no dispute among us. Allah will bring us all together on the Day of Judgment and decide as to who is right and who is wrong, and to Him is the final return"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"Those who dispute concerning Allah after pledging obedience to Him, their dispute is futile in the sight of their Lord, on them is His wrath and for them there will be a terrible punishment"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":17,"Text":"It is Allah Who has revealed this Book (Al- Qur'an) with the truth, and the Balance (to distinguish between right and wrong). What will make you realize that perhaps the hour of doom may be fast approaching"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":18,"Text":"Only those who deny it seek to hasten it on; but the believers dread its coming and know that its coming is the truth. Behold! Those who dispute concerning the hour of doom are far astray"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":19,"Text":"Allah is very Kind to His servants. He gives sustenance to whom He pleases. He is the Powerful, the Almighty"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":20,"Text":"He who desires the harvest of the hereafter, shall be given a many fold increase in his harvest; and he who desires the harvest of this world, a share of it shall be given to him: but in the hereafter he shall have no share at all"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":21,"Text":"Have they made shoraka' (partners with Allah) who, in the practice of their faith, have made lawful to them what Allah has not allowed? Had a decision of making the decision on the Day of Judgment not been issued already, the matter would have certainly been decided between them; surely the wrongdoers will have a painful punishment"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":22,"Text":"You will see that the wrongdoers will be fearing the bad consequences of their deeds which will surely befall them. While those who believe and do good deeds shall dwell in the luxurious gardens of paradise, and shall receive from their Lord all that they wish for; that will surely be the magnificent blessing"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":23,"Text":"Such a blessing is the good news which Allah gives to His servants who believe and do good deeds. O Prophet, say to them: \"I do not ask you any recompense except your love for being my close relatives.\" He that does a good deed shall be repaid many times over. Surely Allah is oft-Forgiving, most-Appreciative"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":24,"Text":"Do they say: \"He has forged a falsehood against Allah?\" But if Allah so willed, He could have sealed your heart. In fact Allah blots out falsehood and vindicates the truth by His words.
