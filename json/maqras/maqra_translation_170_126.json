And should you recall any one from those whom you kept aside, there is no blame on you. It is more likely, in this way, that their eyes will stay content, and they will not grieve, and all of them will be happy with whatever you give to them. Allah knows whatever lies in your hearts, and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":52,"Text":"No women are lawful for you after this, nor is it lawful that you replace them (the present wives) with other wives, even though their goodness may attract you, except the bond-women you own. And Allah is watchful of every thing"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":53,"Text":"O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet, unless you are permitted for a meal, not (so early as) to wait for its preparation. But when you are invited, go inside. Then, once you have had the meal, just disperse, and (do) not (sit for long) being keen for a chat. This (conduct of yours) hurts the Prophet, but he feels shy of (telling) you (about it), but Allah is not shy of the truth. And when you ask any thing from them (the blessed wives of the Prophet), ask them from behind a curtain. That is better for the purity of your hearts and their hearts. It is not allowed for you that you hurt Allah’s Messenger, nor that you ever marry his wives after him. Indeed, it would be an enormity in the sight of Allah"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"If you disclose any thing, or conceal it, Allah is All-Knowing about every thing"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"There is no sin for them (the wives of the Prophet) in (appearing without Hijāb before) their fathers, or their brothers, or the sons of their brothers, or the sons of their sisters, or their own (Muslim) women, or their slave-girls. And (O wives of the Prophet,) fear Allah. Surely, Allah is witness to every thing"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":56,"Text":"Surely, Allah and His angels send blessings to the Prophet.
