Do you hope that those people (whose hearts have become more hardened than rocks and who have continually shown disloyalty to God,) will believe you (and believe in the Prophet Muhammad, and in the Book he brought and the Religion he preaches)? (It is surely not possible) when there has been a party among them that hear the Word of God, and then, after they reasoned and judged it (to be the Word of God), have tampered with it knowingly"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":76,"Text":"When they meet those who believe, they declare (hypocritically), \"We believe (in what you believe in);\" but when they are alone with one another in private, they say (chiding each other): \"Will you tell them what God has disclosed to you, that they might use it as an argument against you before your Lord? Do you have no sense"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":77,"Text":"Do they not know that surely God knows what they keep concealed and what they disclose"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":78,"Text":"Among them are the illiterate folk who do not know anything about the Book except fancies from hearsay, and merely follow their conjectures"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":79,"Text":"Woe, then, to those who write the Book with their hands (interpolating into it their readings of the Scriptures and their explanatory notes thereto, stories from their national history, superstitious ideas and fancies, philosophical doctrines and legal rules) and then in order to sell it for a trifling price (such as worldly benefit, status, and renown), they declare: \"This is from God.\" So woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they have earned (of the worldly income and the sin thereby)"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":80,"Text":"They say (despite all that): \"The Fire will not touch us at all except for a certain number of days.\" Say, then, (to them): \"Have you made a covenant with God and received a promise from Him? If so, God will never break His covenant. Or do you say things against God that you do not know"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":81,"Text":"(It is indeed the case that you speak in ignorance. The truth is,) rather, that whoever earns an evil (by his free will) and his vices engulf him – those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":82,"Text":"While those who believe and do good, righteous deeds, those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":83,"Text":"And (remember) when We took a promise from the Children of Israel: You shall worship none save God (as the only Deity, Lord and Sovereign), and do good to parents in the best way possible, and to the near (relatives), to the orphans, and to the destitute; and speak kindly and well to the people; and establish the Prayer, and pay the Prescribed Purifying Alms. But then you turned away in aversion, all except a few of you; in fact you are a people always avoiding your compacts and responsibilities"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":84,"Text":"And (remember also) when We took a promise from you: you shall not shed blood among yourselves, and shall not expel one another from your habitations. You confirmed it, and you yourselves were (and still must be) witnesses to it"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":85,"Text":"Then, here you are, killing one another, and expelling a party of your own from their habitations, conspiring against them in iniquity and enmity. If you take them as captives, you hold them to ransom, and if they are brought to you as captives, you ransom them; yet their expulsion was made religiously forbidden to you. Then (like a people having no sense) do you believe in part of the Book, and disbelieve in part? What else, then, could be the recompense of those of you who act thus than disgrace in the life of this world? On the Day of Resurrection, they will be consigned to the severest of punishment. God is not unaware and unmindful of what you do"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":86,"Text":"Such are the ones who have bought the present, worldly life (the life of corporeal desires and ambitions) in exchange for the Hereafter. So (in consequence of this exchange) the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be helped (not saved from the punishment in any of the ways they resort to in the world such as bribery, influence, or unjust intercession)"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":87,"Text":"(That is their just deserts. For) We assuredly granted Moses the Book, and after him sent succeeding Messengers (in the footsteps of Moses to judge according to the Book, and thus We have never left them without guides and the light of guidance.) And (in the same succession) We granted Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs of the truth (and of his Messengership), and confirmed him with the Spirit of Holiness. Is it (ever so) that whenever a Messenger comes to you with what (as a message and commandments) does not suit your selves, you grow arrogant, denying some of them (the Messengers) and killing others"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":88,"Text":"(Despite all such favors, affection, forgiveness, advice and truths, they refuse to believe, and by way of excuse they ask derisively: \"Do we need any of what you have to tell?\" Recognizing that what they are told has no effect on them) they say: \"Our hearts have become covered (callous, no longer having any ability to believe).\" No! Rather, because of their unbelief God has cursed them (excluded them from His mercy and set a seal on their hearts and hearing and a veil on their eyes.) So, little do they believe (or can admit of the truth)"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":89,"Text":"And when there has (now) come to them a Book from God, confirming what (of the truth) they already possess – and though before that they were asking for a victory over the (tribes of al-Aws and Khazraj who were then) unbelievers, (saying: \"The Last Prophet will come and we will defeat and destroy you under his leadership\") – and when there has come to them what they recognize (as well as their own sons), they have disbelieved in it. Then God’s curse (rejection) is on the unbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":90,"Text":"How evil is that for which they have sold themselves: (they have disbelieved in what God has sent down) begrudging that God should send down out of His grace the Book (and bestow Messengership) on whomever He wills of His servants. So they have earned wrath upon wrath. And, (as with other unbelievers who, defeated by their haughtiness, malicious envy, racial prejudice, worldly desires and ambitions, knowingly reject the truth) for those unbelievers is a shameful, humiliating punishment"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":91,"Text":"And when they are told (since the sign of a believer is believing in whatever God has sent down): \"Believe in that which He has sent down (on Muhammad, namely the Qur’an),\" they retort: \"We believe in only what was sent down on us,\" and they disbelieve in what is beyond that, though it is the truth, confirming what (of the truth) they already possess. Say (to them, O Messenger): \"Why then did you kill the Prophets of God before, if indeed you are believers (loyal to what was sent down on you)"}]}
