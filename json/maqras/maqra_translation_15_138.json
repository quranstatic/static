No human being shall be burdened with more than he or she is well able to bear. No mother shall be made to suffer because of her child, nor shall a father be made to suffer because of his child. If the father dies, his heir will assume these responsibilities. If both parents decide with mutual consent, there shall be nothing wrong in entrusting your children to foster-mothers. You shall mutually ensure, in a fair manner, the safety of the child you are handing over.

Do not tie the wedding knot nor sign the martial contract until the waiting period has ended. Know that Allah understands human psyche, and that which is in your hearts. Take heed of Him and know that Allah is Forgiving, Clement. He does not wish to impose hardship on you. His Laws protect your society from harm by absolving your imperfections. (Allah, the Clement never gets enraged and His Rule is the Rule of Law)"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":236,"Text":"And, there is no blame on you if you nullify the marriage before you have touched the women with whom you have signed the marital contract, and before you have appointed the marital gift. This would be an unexpected situation involving emotional trauma. Therefore, show compassion by giving her as generous a gift as you can afford. This would be an act of equity and it is a binding duty on all those who wish to be counted among the benefactors of humanity"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":237,"Text":"And if unexpected circumstances lead you to divorce women before you have touched them, but after the marital gift has been fixed, give them half the amount unless they volunteer to forgo it.
