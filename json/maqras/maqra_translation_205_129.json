He knew whatever was in their hearts, thus, He granted them confidence and rewarded them with an immediate victory"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":19,"Text":"and the booty which they received from it (the Battle). God is Majestic and All-wise"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":20,"Text":"God has promised that you will receive much booty. He has enabled you to receive this at this time and has protected you from enemies to make it an evidence (of the Truth) for the believers. He will guide you to the right path"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":21,"Text":"Besides these, there were other gains which you could not receive, but God has full control over them. God has power over all things"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":22,"Text":"Had the disbelievers fought against you, they would have run away from the battle and would have found no guardian or helper"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":23,"Text":"This is the tradition of God which existed before, and you will never find any change in His tradition"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":24,"Text":"It is He who kept peace between you and the people of the valley of Mecca after having given you a victory over them. God is Well Aware of what you do"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":25,"Text":"It was the disbelievers who kept you from the Sacred Mosque and prevented your sacrificial offering from reaching its proper place. God would not have kept you from fighting the disbelievers, had there not been believing men and women (among them) whom you did not know and whom you might have unknowingly harmed. God did this because He grants mercy to whomever He wants. Had they been distinguishable from the believers, We would certainly have punished them with a painful torment"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":26,"Text":"Since the disbelievers held zealous ignorance in their hearts, like that of the pre-Islamic age of darkness, God gave confidence to His Messenger and to the believers, binding them to the principle of piety which they deserve.

God is a Sufficient witness to this Truth"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":29,"Text":"Muhammad is the Messenger of God and those with him are stern to the disbelievers yet kind among themselves. You can see them bowing and prostrating before God, seeking His favors and pleasure. Their faces (foreheads) are marked due to the effect of their frequent prostrations. That is their description in the Torah and in the Gospel they are mentioned as the seed which shoots out its stalk then becomes stronger, harder and stands firm on its stumps, attracting the farmers. Thus, God has described the believers to enrage the disbelievers. God has promised forgiveness and a great reward to the righteously striving believers"}]}
