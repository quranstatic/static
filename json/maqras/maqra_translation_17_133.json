To Jesus, son of Mary, We gave clear proofs and supported him with the holy spirit. If God had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought ˹among themselves˺ after receiving the clear proofs.

But God does what He wills"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":254,"Text":"O believers!

He ˹fully˺ knows what is ahead of them and what is behind them, but no one can grasp any of His knowledge—except what He wills ˹to reveal˺.

So make it rise from the west.” And so the disbeliever was dumbstruck.

God asked, “How long have you remained ˹in this state˺?” He replied, “Perhaps a day or part of a day.” God said, “No! You have remained here for a hundred years! Just look at your food and drink—they have not spoiled. ˹But now˺ look at ˹the remains of˺ your donkey! And ˹so˺ We have made you into a sign for humanity.
