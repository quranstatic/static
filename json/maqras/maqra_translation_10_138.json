(They are historical relics of Allah since Abraham and Ishmael worked there to build the Ka'bah. Rites and rituals in themselves are not the end. They must be treated only as devotional means to a higher goal (22:28)). Therefore, do every good deed possible that will benefit the community. Allah is Appreciative and fully rewards such people. He is all Knowing"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":159,"Text":"Allah has defined the objectives of the Pilgrimage to the Sacred Masjid in this Book (22:28).)

They are the ones whose repentance I accept. And I am the Acceptor, the Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":161,"Text":"Behold, those who reject the Truth and die as rejecters, for them is the rejection of Allah and the Universal Laws and of the human society combined. (Allah's Rule in the Universe is the Rule of Law. Hence, anyone who lives contrary to the changeless Divine Laws only harms himself)"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":162,"Text":"Since the 'Self' survives after physical death, such men and women logically keep suffering relentlessly"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":163,"Text":"And (remember that) your God is One God.

Behold, there are ample Signs for you in the Universe. In the creation of the heavens and the earth, the alternation of night and day, the ships that roam the ocean for the benefit of mankind, the water that Allah sends down from the heights, thereby giving life to the land after it had been lifeless - and the variety of creatures that are dispersed on the earth, the currents of winds and the clouds they carry at various heights, are clear Signs for those who exercise their intellect. (The Universe is too organized to be the result of an accident)"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":165,"Text":"Yet, among mankind are those who consider idols and saints to possess the Attributes of Power and Control like Allah does, and revere them as only God should be revered. But the true believers revere Allah more than all else. (7:3). Oh, that those who relegate the Truth could but see, as see they will when they are made to suffer!

(In matters of eating and drinking, follow that the Qur'an is telling you, and not what people say). Eat of what is on earth, Lawful, clean, wholesome, decent and pleasing, and of your liking, and let not your selfish desire lead your reason and judgment, step by step into error. Behold, your rebellious desire (Satan) is an enemy that lays bare even your hidden imperfections.

Behold, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":174,"Text":"Verily, those who (start making their own lists of the lawful and the unlawful try to) conceal the Book of Allah - They purchase a small gain with it. They eat into their bellies nothing but Fire. Allah will not even address them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will make them grow to further evolution of the 'Self'. For them will be a painful doom (since they infringed upon the Divine Authority of Law-giving)"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":175,"Text":"They are the ones who are buying error in exchange for Guidance, and buying torment in exchange for security.
