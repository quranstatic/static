Allah is free of all wants, and the most Forbearing"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":264,"Text":"Oh you who believe! Do not mar (and void) your charity by stressing your generosity, and by inflicting (emotional) abuse. Do not be like those who spend their wealth (in charity) solely to be seen _ (to gain public esteem). They neither believe in Allah nor in the life-to-come. Their example is that of the boulder covered by a thin layer of topsoil. When a rainstorm strikes, (the topsoil washes off and) the rock is left bare. They wonÂ´t be able to benefit from the good deeds they earn. Allah does not guide the nation of unbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":265,"Text":"(On the other hand) the example of those who spend their wealth seeking the acceptance and approval of Allah, and with the certainty of belief (that they would be rewarded), is that of fertile garden on high ground. In case there is a heavy rainfall, its yield doubles. But even light moisture suffices. Allah watches (vigilantly) over everything you do"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":266,"Text":"Would any of you like to own a fertile garden _ right through which run the rivers _ containing date palms and grape-vines, and yielding all kinds of fruit?

Do not pick out the worst and the worthless things to give in charity, which you would yourself accept _ if you do at all _ (reluctantly and) with disdain. Know it (for sure) that Allah is Self-sufficient and Praiseworthy (in His own right)"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":268,"Text":"Shaitan scares you with (the prospect of) poverty, and bids you to adopt (lewd and) shameless conduct, while Allah promises you His forgiveness and (His) bounties! Allah is the Bounteous, the most Aware"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":269,"Text":"He grants wisdom to whomever He wants. The one given the wisdom has really been granted an abundant (and enduring) wealth.

The wrong doers do not have any helpers"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":271,"Text":"It is good if you (give openly and) let your charity be known.
