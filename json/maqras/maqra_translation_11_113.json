Rather, pious is he who believes (firmly) in Allah, the last day, the angels, the scriptures, and the prophets. (Pious is he, who) spends his wealth (in charity) _ out of love for Him _ on his kinsfolk, the orphans, the poor, and the wayfarer. (Pious is the one who) gives (help) to those who ask (for help), and (spends money) to free slaves. And (pious are those who) establish ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´, and fulfill the pledges made by them. Those who endure and display fortitude during poverty and adversity, and during times of crises. Such are the people who are sincere! Such are the pious ones"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":178,"Text":"´Qisas´ _ (just retribution and blood money) _ is prescribed to you in cases involving (manslaughter and) murder. (If) the free man (murders), then (that) free man (should be charged). If a slave, then (that) slave, and if a woman, then (that) woman. (The offender alone and no one else is accountable). If the offender receives forgiveness from the victim´s brother (and guardian), then compliance of (the rules of) blood money and a fair award to the victim´s family is obligatory. This is the relief (and a reprieve) from your Lord. A mercy (from Him)! There is the painful punishment for anyone who transgresses after that"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":179,"Text":"Oh people endowed with (knowledge and) insight! (The principle of) ´Qisas´ embodies (the gift of) life for you! Perhaps, you would adopt piety"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":180,"Text":"You are being instructed. If death approaches any of you and he leaves behind wealth, then let him draw up a will in a fair manner, and let him bequeath his belongings to his parents and kinsfolk. That is an obligation upon the pious"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":181,"Text":"Later on, if the one who hears the will falsifies it, then (of course) the one who changes the will shall incur the sin. Of course Allah hears all, and knows all"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":182,"Text":"But the one who, fearing that the testator had sinned and veered off (the just course), corrects and adjusts the will, incurs no sin. Allah is the most Forgiving, the most Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":183,"Text":"Oh you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you just as it was prescribed for those before you. Perhaps you would attain piety"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":184,"Text":"(Fasting is obligatory for) a certain number of specified days. But if any of you is sick or on a journey, then the same number of other days (may be substituted). The one who suffers hardship (because of fasting) may (redeem himself and) feed a needy person. If he, of his own accord, does better (and feeds more than one person), then he would do so for his own good. However, it is much better for you to fast, if you only knew"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":185,"Text":"Ramadhan is the month during which the Qur´an was revealed. It is (not only) the guidance for mankind, (but is also) the self-evident proof of (the truth of) that guidance, and (it is) the criterion (of the right and the wrong conduct). Whoever among you lives to see that month, must observe fasts (during that month). Whoever among you is sick or on a journey, (must fast) the same number of other days. Allah wants to make matters easy for you; He does not want to impose hardships on you. So complete the period (of fasting). Glorify Allah (and thank Him) for the guidance He has granted. Perhaps, you would be grateful"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":186,"Text":"And when My servants ask about Me (tell them that) in fact, I am (always) nearby. I answer the prayers and pleas of the callers when they implore Me. Therefore, they should submit to Me and believe in Me. Perhaps, they would be led along the right path"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":187,"Text":"It is permissible for you to approach your wives (sexually) during the night of the fasting (day). They are (like) your garments _ (close to you: they clothe your nakedness, and your passions) _ and you are (like) their garments. Of course, Allah knows that you (had succumbed to desire and) were cheating yourself (by engaging in sexual activity during the nights of fasting). He has accepted your repentance and has pardoned you. Now, you may have (social and sexual) relations with your wives (during the night of fasting). Seek from their company that _ (peace and progeny) _ which Allah has ordained for you. (You may) eat and drink until the white streak (of dawn) becomes visible (on the horizon) against the darkness. Thereafter, complete the fast till nightfall. Do not have (sexual) contact with your wives when you confine yourself in a mosque (to worship). These are the bounds of Allah. Do not approach them (much less exceed them). Thus, Allah makes His revelations manifestly clear for mankind. Perhaps, you would fear (Allah) and attain piety"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":188,"Text":"Do not usurp each other´s possessions unfairly _ by foul means and fraud. Do not, knowingly and sinfully, give (bribes, or false) statements to a judge (or others in authority, intending) to usurp the (rights and) possessions of others"}]}
