Say to them: \"It may well be quite soon"},{"SurahNumber":17,"VerseNumber":52,"Text":"This shall be the Day when He summons you all from the graves and you rise praising the O Allah and ascribing His glory"},{"SurahNumber":17,"VerseNumber":53,"Text":"Tell My servants O Muhammad who declare or state in words a specified fact, thought, opinion or intention, an event or a remark or the like to say what is friendly, favourable and laudatory and to keep a civil tongue in their heads, for AL-Shaytan is on the alert for an occasion to divide mankind and set them at variance and to stir up enmity among them. Indeed AL-Shaytan has always been to man an avowed enemy"},{"SurahNumber":17,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Allah, your Creator, knows best your disposition. He has mercy on you if He will or if He will He inflicts you with punishment, and We did not send you to the people to be their tutelary guardian"},{"SurahNumber":17,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"Allah, your Creator, knows best all creatures, the animate and the inanimate in the heavens and on earth and We invested some prophets with more privileges than we invested others and We gave David the Psalms"},{"SurahNumber":17,"VerseNumber":56,"Text":"Say to the infidels who incorporate with Allah other deities \"Ask earnestly or humbly or make a devout supplication to those objects of worship whom you suppose share with Allah His divine nature and you shall realize that they shall utterly fail to respond.

Among them were the Thamudites to whom We sent the she â€“camel- as an evident and undoubted sign, but they mistreated her without due regard and wronged themselves.

We only made you see the vision of glory We presented to you in your night journey through the spiritual world to test the inclination of the people and their spiritual and moral attributes. The same purpose was also served by the accursed tree growing in the bottom of Hell to feed the sinners. We purposed that the infidels be moved with a mingled feeling of dread and veneration toward Allah and realize the evil consequence of disobeying and denying Him. But on the contrary, it only makes them sink deeper under the vexations of their minds, run riot and transgress the goal"},{"SurahNumber":17,"VerseNumber":61,"Text":"We said to the angels: \"Prostrate yourselves to Adam in adoration\", and they prostrated to him in comely order, praise and admiration except Iblis AL- Shaytan-to-be who said: \"Shall I prostrate myself before him whom You created from clay"},{"SurahNumber":17,"VerseNumber":62,"Text":"And he added: \"Do you see that creature whom you treated with more honour than you treated me!\" \"If You grant me respite from death till The Day of Judgement, I will bridle his progeny, control them and misguide them excepting a few"},{"SurahNumber":17,"VerseNumber":63,"Text":"Reprieve is granted\", said Allah, \"wherefore you and those of them who follow you shall suffer the fatal consequence.
