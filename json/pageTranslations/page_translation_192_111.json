Surely, a great number among the scholars (of religious matters) and (those posing as God-) fearing people definitely eat up the possessions of the people in an undesirable way and they obstruct people from the Way of Allah.

So taste what you have been collecting as a treasure.”"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":36,"Text":"Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in one year) in Kitabullah (since) the Day He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are sacred and protected (i.e., the last four months of every lunar year. See Verse number 28 of this Surah, and also Verses 1st to 5th). This is the Established Religion (and it creates an atmosphere of peace and tranquility throughout the world during the month of Fasting and the three-months’ season of Hajj). So wrong not therein your ownselves (by initiating armed encounters). And do indulge in Qital with Mushrikun collectively as they make Qital with you collectively (if and when they pay no regard to the ‘protected’ status of the closing four months). And be aware that Allah is with those who are righteous"}]}
