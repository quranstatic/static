Do not exceed the limits in your way of life; and do not comment about Allah except (what is) The Truth. Without doubt Al-Maseeh, Iesa, Ibn-e-Maryam is Rasulullah (Messenger of Allah) and His Kalimah, which He bestowed on Maryam and a Ruh (Spirit) proceeding from Him. So Believe in Allah and His Messengers and utter not:' Trinity (‘three’)!' Desist (from such utterances, concepts and beliefs; that would be) better for you. Certainly, what is a fact is that Allah is a single deity. He stands absolved and exalted that there happens for Him a son. To Him belongs whatever (is) in the heavens and whatever (is) in the earth. And Allah sufficed as an Advocate (to the Believers)"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":172,"Text":"Al-Maseeh (The Messiah) will never reject in pride that he becomes an Abd to Allah and nor the closest Angels. And whoever abstains in pride from His obedience, and he exhibits undue and unjust pride, then very soon He shall gather them towards Him en masse"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":173,"Text":"Then, as for those who Believed and did righteous deeds so He will fully pay them their rewards and shall increase (for) them out of His Bounty.
