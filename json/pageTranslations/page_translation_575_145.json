He knows that you will not keep count of it and has relented unto you; so recite that which is easy for you of the Quran. He knows that some of you will be sick, while others travel upon the earth, seeking God’s Bounty, and others fight in the way of God. So recite that which is easy of it, perform the prayer, give the alms, and lend unto God a goodly loan—whatever good you send forth for your souls, you will find it with God better and greater in reward. And seek God’s Forgiveness. Truly God is Forgiving, Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O thou who art covered"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"arise and warn"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Thy Lord magnify"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"Thy garments purify"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"And defilement shun"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"Grant not favor, seeking gain"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"And for the sake of thy Lord be patient"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"For when the trumpet is blown"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"that Day shall be a difficult day"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"for the disbelievers, not of ease"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Leave Me alone with the one whom I created"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"and to whom I gave vast wealth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"and sons at his side"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"and made smooth the way for him"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Yet he desires that I give more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"Nay!
