Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness and a great reward"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O you who believe, do not decide [any matter of importance] before Allah and His Messenger, and fear Allah, for Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"O you who believe, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor speak loudly to him as you speak loudly to one another, lest your deeds become worthless without you realizing it"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Indeed, those who lower their voices in the presence of the Messenger of Allah are those whose hearts Allah has tested for righteousness.
