There and then did the Muslims return, by the grace of Allah and His bounty, unharmed and not even touched physically in any way. They espoused the cause of Allah and His satisfaction and were consequently qualified to receive His blessings, and Allah’s bounty is plentiful, full flowing"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":175,"Text":"It was only AL-Shaytan hiding behind those with characteristics befitting him, who inspired terror in the hearts and minds of those who were submissive to them, who in turn tried to transmit it to some of you!

Nor did Allah intend to endow you people with the prerogative of divination nor with power of knowing the unknown or realizing the unseen or the invisible. Yet He chooses from His Prophets whom He will and gives them knowledge of events to come according to His will.

To Allah shall be the inheritance of the realms of the Heavens and the Earth, and Allah is 'Alimun of all that you do"}]}
