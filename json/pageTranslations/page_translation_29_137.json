They are Libas [i.e., body-cover, or screen] for you and you are Libas for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which Allah has ordained for you (offspring), and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your fast till the nightfall. And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I`tikaf in the Masjids. These are the limits (set) by Allah, so approach them not. Thus does Allah make clear His Ayat to mankind that they may acquire Taqwa"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":188,"Text":"And eat up not one another's property unjustly (in any illegal way, e.g., stealing, robbing, deceiving), nor give bribery to the rulers (judges before presenting your cases) that you may knowingly eat up a part of the property of others sinfully"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":189,"Text":"They ask you (O Muhammad) about the crescents. Say: \"These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage.\" It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, etc.) that you enter the houses from the back, but Al-Birr is from Taqwa. So enter houses through their proper doors, and have Taqwa of Allah that you may be successful"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":190,"Text":"And fight in the way of Allah those who fight you, but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allah likes not the transgressors"}]}
