But do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animal has reached the place of sacrifice. If any of you are ill or have a head injury, the expiation is fasting or sadaqa or sacrifice when you are safe and well again. Anyone who comes out of ihram between ´umra and hajj should make whatever sacrifice is feasible. For any one who cannot, there are three days´ fast on hajj and seven on your return — that is ten in all. That is for anyone whose family does not live near the Masjid al-Haram. Have taqwa of Allah and know that Allah is severe in retribution"}]}
