Before you rise for ´salat´ (for prayers), wash your face and your hands up to your elbows, run your (wet) hands across your head, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. Clean yourself (by bathing) if you are unclean (following a sexual experience). In case you are ill, or on a journey, or if you have been to the toilet, or if you have had (sexual) contact with (your) women and you do not find water to clean yourself, then perform ´tayyamum´. Find a (rock or a) slab of earth and (after touching it) run your hands over your face and hands. Allah does not want to burden you with inconveniences. Rather, He wants to purify you and complete His blessings upon you. Perhaps, you would be grateful"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"Bear in mind the blessings Allah bestowed upon you _ His covenant by which He has bound you; (you ratified that covenant), when you said, \"We hear and we obey.\" Fear Allah and do your duty!

Remain steadfast and be the just and upright witness for Allah. Do not let your hatred (and prejudice) for a people compel you to be unfair. Be just! That is closer to righteousness. And Fear Allah! Indeed, Allah is well Aware of what you do"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"Allah has promised forgiveness and a rich reward for those who believe and do righteous deeds"}]}
