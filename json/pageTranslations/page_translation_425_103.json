And if you desire any you have left alone, there is nothing wrong in that. This makes it more likely they will be comforted and not be grieved, and all of them will be content with what you give them. Allah knows what is in your hearts.

Allah is watchful over all things"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":53,"Text":"You who have iman! do not go into the Prophet´s rooms except when you are invited to come and eat. Do not wait there while the food is being cooked. However, when you are called, go in, and when you have eaten, disperse, not remaining there to chat with one another. Doing that causes annoyance to the Prophet though he is too reticent to tell you so. But Allah is not reticent with the truth. When you ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a screen. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts. It is not right for you to cause annoyance to the Messenger of Allah or ever to marry his wives after him. To do that would be a dreadful thing in Allah´s sight"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Whether you divulge a thing or conceal it, Allah has knowledge of all things"}]}
