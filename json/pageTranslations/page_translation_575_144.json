And God measures the night and the day. He knows that you will not be able to keep-up, so He pardons you. So read what is made easy of the Qur'an. He knows that there will be sick among you, and others that go forth in the land seeking from the bounty of God, and others who are fighting in the cause of God, so read what you can of it. And hold the contact prayer and contribute towards purification and lend God a loan of righteousness. And whatever you put forth yourselves, you will find it with God, for it is better and a greater reward. And seek the forgiveness of God, for God is Forgiving, Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O you who are cloaked"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Stand and warn"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"And your Lord magnify"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"And purify your garments"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"And abandon that which afflicts"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"And do not give for a return"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"And to your Lord be patient"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"So when the horn is sounded"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"That will be a very difficult Day"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"Upon the rejecters it will not be easy"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"So leave Me alone with he whom I have created"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"And I gave him abundant wealth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"And sons to bear witness"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"And I made everything comfortable for him"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Then he is greedy, wanting that I give more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"No. He was stubborn to Our revelations"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":17,"Text":"I will exhaust him in ascending"}]}
