They say, \"Had we had the matter in our hands, we would not have been killed there.\" Tell them, \"Even if you had stayed in your own homes, your sworn enemies could have attacked you and slain you while you were in your beds. God wanted to test you and purge what existed in your hearts"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":155,"Text":"God knows what the hearts contain. Because of some of your bad deeds, those of you who ran away, when you faced the enemy, were misled by Satan.
