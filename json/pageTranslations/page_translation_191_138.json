{"Id":138,"LanguageCodes":["en","eng"],"Name":"eng-shabbirahmed","Author":"Shabbir Ahmed","Language":"English","Description":"English","Direction":"ltr","Source":"","Translations":[{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":27,"Text":"Allah will turn in Mercy to the worthy according to His Laws. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":28,"Text":"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! The idolaters have made their hearts unclean (and the Sacred Masjid of Makkah is the House of Pure Monotheism. Only those who believe in the Divine System can administer this Sacred House (9:18)). So let not the Idolaters come close to it after this year. If you fear scarcity of trade, Allah will enrich you with His Bounty. This is the Promise of Allah who is Knower, Wise"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":29,"Text":"Fight against those who reject belief in Allah and the Last Day, and hold not Sacred what Allah and His Messenger have declared Sacred, nor acknowledge the Divine System, among those who received the Scripture, until they pay JIZYA, the tax, with willing submission, and feel themselves subjects of the State as law-abiding citizens. (As citizens of the State they must pay taxes, as the Muslims contribute toward the Just Economic Order of Zakat. In return, the State will guarantee them internal and external security, and equal rights of citizenship. JIZYA will always be less than Zakat, and will be payable only by the able-bodied Non-Muslim citizens of the State. In addition, these able-bodied citizens would be exempt from compulsory military service)"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":30,"Text":"The Jews say, \"Uzayr is God's son,\" while the Christians say, \"The Messiah is God's son.\" They only utter baseless themes with their mouths, following in spirit assertions made in earlier times by people (like the Greeks and Zoroastrians) who denied the Truth! Allah condemns them. They are surely deluded. (Some Jews in the Arabian Peninsula used to believe that Osiris, the Egyptian idol, was God's son while others thought of Ezra, who restored the Torah after it had been lost in the Babylonian Exile, as God's son)"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":31,"Text":"They take their rabbis, priests and monks to be their Lords* besides Allah. And they take as their Lord, the Messiah son of Mary. Yet they were commanded to worship but One God. There is no god but He. Praise and Glory to Him, He is far too Glorious for what they ascribe to Him. (*Talmud shows the Jewish superstition of ascribing divinity to Ezra, rabbis, saints, doctors of law and learned men. And the doctrine of Papal infallibility, divinity of saints and praying to them are common in the Roman Catholic Church)"}]}
