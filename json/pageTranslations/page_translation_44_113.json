Do not mar (and void) your charity by stressing your generosity, and by inflicting (emotional) abuse. Do not be like those who spend their wealth (in charity) solely to be seen _ (to gain public esteem). They neither believe in Allah nor in the life-to-come. Their example is that of the boulder covered by a thin layer of topsoil. When a rainstorm strikes, (the topsoil washes off and) the rock is left bare. They wonÂ´t be able to benefit from the good deeds they earn. Allah does not guide the nation of unbelievers"}]}
