And Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you can never calculate it (unable to pray the whole night), so He has turned to you (in Mercy). So, recite from the Qur’an as much as may be easy for you. He knows that there may be some sick among you, and some others who travel through the land to seek Allah’s Bounty; and yet, some others who fight in Allah’s cause. So recite as much of it (Qur’an) as may be easy for you, establish prayer, pay obligatory charity, and lend to Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you will send before you (leave the world) for yourselves, you will certainly find it with Allah, which is better and greater in reward. And seek the forgiveness of Allah. Surely, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O you (Muhammad) enveloped (in garments)"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Arise and warn"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Proclaim (the greatness of) your Lord (Allah)"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"and purify your garments"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"and keep away from filth (idols)"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"and don’t give a thing to have more (obey Allah not as a Favor to Him)"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"and be patient for the sake of your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"When the trumpet will be sounded"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"surely, that Day will be a hard Day"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"not easy for the disbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Leave Me alone to deal with whom I created alone (without any means, including Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah, a bitter opponent of the prophet)"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"and Allah granted him abundant resources"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"and children by his side"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"and made life smooth and comfortable for him"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Yet, he desires that I should give more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"Nay!
