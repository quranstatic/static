By it the Prophets who always sincerely submitted to Allah, judged the Jews. And the rabbis and the priests judged according to Allah's Scripture as they were commanded to observe. For to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's Book, and they were witnesses to it. So, fear not people, but fear Me and do not trade away My Revelations for petty gains.
