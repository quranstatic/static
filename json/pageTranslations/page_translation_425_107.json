That makes it likelier that they will be comforted and not feel unhappy, and all of them will be pleased with what you give them.

Allah is watchful over all things"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":53,"Text":"O you who have faith! Do not enter the Prophetâ€™s houses for a meal until you are granted permission, without hanging around for it to be readied. But enter when you are invited, and disperse when you have taken your meal, without cozying up for chats. Such conduct on your part offends the Prophet, and he is ashamed of [asking] you [to leave]; but Allah is not ashamed of [expressing] the truth. When you ask [his] womenfolk for something, do so from behind a curtain. That is more chaste for your hearts and theirs. You should not offend the Apostle of Allah, nor may you ever marry his wives after him. Indeed that would be a grave [sin] with Allah"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Whether you disclose anything or hide it, Allah indeed knows all things"}]}
