God determines the division of night and day. He knows that you will not be able to keep a measure of it and He has relented towards all of you, so recite as much of the Quran as is easy for you. He knows that some of you will be sick, some of you travelling through the land seeking God’s bounty, some of you fighting in God’s way: recite as much as is easy for you, keep up the prayer, pay the prescribed alms, and make God a good loan. Whatever good you store up for yourselves will be improved and increased for you. Ask God for His forgiveness, He is most forgiving, most merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"You, wrapped in your cloak"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"arise and give warning"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Proclaim the greatness of your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"cleanse yourself"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"keep away from all filth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"do not be overwhelmed and weaken"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"be steadfast in your Lord’s cause"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"When the Trumpet sounds"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"that will be a Day of anguish for the disbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"They will have no ease"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"[Prophet], leave Me to deal with the one I created helpless"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"then gave vast wealth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"and sons by his side"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"making everything easy for him––"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"yet he still hopes I will give him more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"No!
