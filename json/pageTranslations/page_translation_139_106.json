Then leave them playing in their useless discussions"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":92,"Text":"And this book (Quran), which We sent it down is blessed, confirming that which was before it, and so that you warn (the people of) the mother town (Mecca) and around it. And those who believe in the hereafter believe in it, and they guard their mandatory prayer"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":93,"Text":"And who is more wrong than someone who makes up a lie (and attributes it) to God, or says that it was revealed to me while nothing was revealed to him, and anyone who says: I am going to send down like what God sent down. And if you see when the wrongdoers are in the tug of the death and the angels open their hands (saying): eject your souls, today you are punished a humiliating punishment for what you were unjustifiably saying against God and for being arrogant about His signs (and not accepting them)"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":94,"Text":"And you have certainly come to Us individually as We created you the first time, and you left behind your backs whatever We gave you, and We do not see your mediators with you, those you claimed were partners (of God) in you.
