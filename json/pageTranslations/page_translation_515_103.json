And their likeness in the Injil is that of a seed which puts up a shoot and makes it strong so that it thickens and grows up straight upon its stalk, filling the sowers with delight — so that by them He may infuriate the kuffar. Allah has promised those of them who have iman and do right actions forgiveness and an immense reward"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"You who have iman! do not put yourselves forward in front of Allah and of His Messenger; and have taqwa of Allah.
