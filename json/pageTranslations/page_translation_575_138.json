Your Lord is fully Aware (that you are dedicated to your Mission). There are nights when you stay up working two thirds, one half, or one third of the night as do your companions. But Allah has designed night and day. You and your companions cannot over-work indefinitely. So He turns to you in kindness. (He does not ordain for you hardship). Inculcate, then, as much of the Qur'anic teachings in their hearts as you may do with ease. He knows that among you are sick people, and others have to earn their living and travel for it. And those who have to fight in the Cause of Allah. Recite and convey the Qur'an, then, at ease. And establish the Divine System and set up the Just Economic Order. And lend unto Allah a goodly loan. Whatever good you send forth for your 'Selves' you will find with Allah, better and more excellent in reward. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Behold, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O You founder of the most Benevolent Order"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Rise up to the occasion and post danger signs on the highway of life"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Establish the Greatness of your Lord on earth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"Keep a meticulous character!
