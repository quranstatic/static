But, there were believing men and women in their midst whom you did not know. Unwittingly, you would have killed them, and unknowingly you would have suffered the sin (of having killed the believers). Therefore, Allah restrained your hands, so that He might admit into His mercy whomever He wants. Had they (the believing men and women) stood apart, We would have punished the disbelievers with the painful punishment"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":26,"Text":"Right then, the unbelievers displayed arrogance; they bolstered their hearts with an ignorant and boastful zealotry. Allah conferred a comforting calm over His messenger, and the believers. He imposed upon them (the self-restraint, and) the words of piety. They were worthy of that (honor); they deserved it! Allah is well Aware of every single thing"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":27,"Text":"Of course, Allah caused His messenger to witness a true vision in his dream. (It shall come true)!

Besides this one, He has arranged another victory for you in the near future"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":28,"Text":"He it is, Who has sent His messenger with the guidance, and the religion of truth. So He may cause it to prevail over all (false) religions, (over all ism, and in all walks of life). Allah is a sufficient Witness"}]}
