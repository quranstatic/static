God justly evaluates the night and the day. He knows that you will not be able to sustain it, so He will not require it of you. Read from the Qur'an what you can. He knows that some of you may be ill; and others travelling through the land, seeking God's bounty; yet others will be fighting in God's cause. So read from it what is easy for you, and observe the prayers, and pay The purifying alms, and lend God a loan of goodness. Whatever good you advance for yourselves, you will find it with God, improved and increased for you. Ask God's forgiveness, for God is Forgiving and Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"You, wrapped in your shroud"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"arise and give warning"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"glorify your Lord' greatness"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"purify your clothing and"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"avoid all filth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"Do not give out of a desire for gain"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"But be steadfast for your Lord's cause"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"When the Trumpet is blown"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"that Day will be a difficult day"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"not easy for the unbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Leave Me alone with the one I created"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"to whom I gave great wealth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"sons around him"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"and for whom I smoothed all things"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Then he desires that I should add more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"No!
