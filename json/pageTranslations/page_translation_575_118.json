But God measureth the night and the day: He knoweth that ye cannot count its hours aright, and therefore, turneth to you mercifully. Recite then so much of the Koran as may be easy to you. He knoweth that there will be some among you sick, while others travel through the earth in quest of the bounties of God; and others do battle in his cause. Recite therefore so much of it as may be easy. And observe the Prayers and pay the legal Alms, and lend God a liberal loan: for whatever good works ye send on before for your own behoof, ye shall find with God. This will be best and richest in the recompense. And seek the forgiveness of God: verily, God is forgiving, Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O THOU, ENWRAPPED in thy mantle"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Arise and warn"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Thy Lord - magnify Him"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"Thy raiment - purify it"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"The abomination - flee it"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"And bestow not favours that thou mayest receive again with increase"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"And for thy Lord wait thou patiently"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"For when there shall be a trump on the trumpet"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"That shall be a distressful day"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"A day, to the Infidels, devoid of ease"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Leave me alone to deal with him whom I have created"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"And on whom I have bestowed vast riches"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"And sons dwelling before him"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"And for whom I have smoothed all things smoothly down"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Yet desireth he that I should add more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"But no! because to our signs he is a foe"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":17,"Text":"I will lay grievous woes upon him"}]}
