If the person slain is from your enemies but himself is a believer, the penalty is to set free a believing slave. If the person slain is one of those with whom you have a peace treaty, the penalty is the same as that for a slain believer. If this is not possible, the defendant has to fast for two consecutive months, asking God to accept his repentance. He is All-knowing and All-wise"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":93,"Text":"The punishment for one who purposely slays a believer will be to live in hell fire forever. God is angry with him and has condemned him. He has prepared for him a great torment"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":94,"Text":"Believers, if you march with arms for the cause of God, make sure that you know whom to fight. Do not accuse anyone who claims himself to be a Muslim of disbelief just for worldly gains. There is abundant bounty with God. Before, you were also like them, but God bestowed His favors upon you. Thus, make sure that you know whom to fight. God is Well Aware of what you do"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":95,"Text":"Among the believers, those who stay at home without a good reason are not equal to those who strive for the cause of God in person or with their property. To those who strive for His cause in person or with their property, God has granted a higher rank than to those who stay at home. God has promised that everyone will receive his proper share of the reward but He will grant a much greater reward to those striving for His cause than to those who stay home (for no reason)"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":96,"Text":"God will grant those who strive high ranks, forgiveness, and mercy. He is All-forgiving and All-merciful"}]}
