There is not a secret consultation between three, but He makes the fourth among them -- nor between five but He makes the sixth -- nor between fewer nor more, but He is in their midst, wherever they may be: in the end He will tell them the truth about their conduct, on the Day of Judgement. For God has full knowledge of all things"},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"Have you not seen how those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels yet revert to that which they were forbidden to do? And they conspire to indulge in wrongdoing, aggressive behaviour and disobedience to the Messenger. When they come to you, they greet you, but not in the words God would use, and inwardly they wonder, \"Why does God not punish us for what we say?\" Hell will be a fitting punishment for them: they will burn in its flames -- a wretched fate"},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"Believers, when you confer together in private, do not confer in support of sin and transgression and disobedience to the Messenger, but confer for the promotion of virtue and righteousness. Fear God, before whom you shall all be gathered"},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"Conspiracy for evil purposes is the work of Satan, by which he means to bring grief to believers.

That is best for you and most conducive to purity. But if you cannot find anything to give, know that God is Forgiving and Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"Do you fear that you will not [be able to] give in charity before your consultation? Then if you are unable to do so, [know that] God has turned to you in His mercy; then observe your prayers and pay the prescribed alms and obey God and His Messenger. God is aware of all that you do"}]}
