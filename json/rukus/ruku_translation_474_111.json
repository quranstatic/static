(This life is) like (the) rain: its vegetation brought the sowing-tillers to wonder; afterwards it dries up, so you see it turned yellowish, then it becomes straw. While in the Hereafter is severe torment, as well as Forgiveness from Allah, and (His) Agreement (and Assent). And what is the life devoted to this immediate world (alone) except a deceitful enjoyment"},{"SurahNumber":57,"VerseNumber":21,"Text":"Race one with another towards Forgiveness proceeding from your Nourisher-Sustainer, and towards Paradise — the dimension thereof is as the dimensions of the heaven and the earth (together). It has been prepared for those who have Believed in Allah and His Messengers. This is the Bounty of Allah. He bestows it whom He thinks proper. And Allah is the Possessor of the Supreme Bounty"},{"SurahNumber":57,"VerseNumber":22,"Text":"Has not reached out of a calamity inside the earth and nor inside your ownselves, but it (has come) in record before We bring it into action.

(See Verses 43/63, 61/6)]; and sent down alongwith them Al-Kitab and Al-Mizan (‘The Balance’) so that humans may establish (themselves) with justice. And We sent down iron; therein (is material for) violent warfare and benefits for mankind, and so that Allah may distinguish and comes to know who helps Him and His Messengers unseen.
