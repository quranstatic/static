It had to be done without divorcing any of the existing wives. The solution: suspend the limit of four wives for the prophet). Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful.

The woman was the prophet´s first cousin"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":51,"Text":"You are being given the right! You may live apart from, or take up residence with whichever wife you want.
