This (conduct of yours) hurts the Prophet, but he feels shy of (telling) you (about it), but Allah is not shy of the truth. And when you ask any thing from them (the blessed wives of the Prophet), ask them from behind a curtain. That is better for the purity of your hearts and their hearts. It is not allowed for you that you hurt Allah’s Messenger, nor that you ever marry his wives after him. Indeed, it would be an enormity in the sight of Allah"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"If you disclose any thing, or conceal it, Allah is All-Knowing about every thing"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"There is no sin for them (the wives of the Prophet) in (appearing without Hijāb before) their fathers, or their brothers, or the sons of their brothers, or the sons of their sisters, or their own (Muslim) women, or their slave-girls.
