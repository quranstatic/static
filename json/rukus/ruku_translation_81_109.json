Be upholders and standard-bearers of justice, bearing witness to the truth for Godâ€™s sake, even though it be against your own selves, or parents or kindred. Whether the person concerned be rich or poor, (bear in mind that) God is nearer to them (than you are and more concerned with their well-being). So do not (in expectation of some gain from the rich or out of misplaced compassion for the poor) follow your own desires lest you swerve from justice. If you distort (the truth) or decline (to bear truthful witness), then know that God is fully aware of all that you do"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":136,"Text":"O you who believe! Believe in God and His Messenger (Muhammad) and the Book He has been sending down on His Messenger in parts and the (Divine) Books He sent down before.

Assuredly, God will gather the hypocrites and the unbelievers all together in Hell"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":141,"Text":"(The hypocrites are) those who wait to see what befalls you: thus if a victory comes to you from God, they say, \"Were we not with you?\" but if the unbelievers meet with a success, they say (to them:) \"Did we not gain leverage over you (by not joining the believers and weakening them from within) and did we not defend you from the believers?\" God will judge between you (and them) on the Day of Resurrection, and never will God allow the unbelievers to find a way (to triumph) over the (true) believers"}]}
