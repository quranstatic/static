Indeed AL-Shaytan has always been to man an avowed enemy"},{"SurahNumber":17,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Allah, your Creator, knows best your disposition. He has mercy on you if He will or if He will He inflicts you with punishment, and We did not send you to the people to be their tutelary guardian"},{"SurahNumber":17,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"Allah, your Creator, knows best all creatures, the animate and the inanimate in the heavens and on earth and We invested some prophets with more privileges than we invested others and We gave David the Psalms"},{"SurahNumber":17,"VerseNumber":56,"Text":"Say to the infidels who incorporate with Allah other deities \"Ask earnestly or humbly or make a devout supplication to those objects of worship whom you suppose share with Allah His divine nature and you shall realize that they shall utterly fail to respond. They have neither the power to relieve you from what is burdensome and exhaustive to the mind nor the influence to avert it either"},{"SurahNumber":17,"VerseNumber":57,"Text":"Those to whom they make a devout supplication -Saints, jinn or angels- are themselves devout servants of Allah seeking the union of their nature with the Divine, and striving which of them shall be the nearest to Allah and the more efficient in serving His purpose!

Among them were the Thamudites to whom We sent the she â€“camel- as an evident and undoubted sign, but they mistreated her without due regard and wronged themselves.

We only made you see the vision of glory We presented to you in your night journey through the spiritual world to test the inclination of the people and their spiritual and moral attributes. The same purpose was also served by the accursed tree growing in the bottom of Hell to feed the sinners. We purposed that the infidels be moved with a mingled feeling of dread and veneration toward Allah and realize the evil consequence of disobeying and denying Him.
