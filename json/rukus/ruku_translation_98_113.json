Allah will surely put you through a trial (during the pilgrimage) by letting the game animals wander within your easy grasp, and within the range of your spears. Thus Allah will mark those who fear Him, despite the fact that they are unable to see Him. There shall be a painful punishment for anyone who strays beyond the bounds thereafter"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":95,"Text":"Oh you who believe! Do not kill (or hunt) a game animal while you are in a state of ´Ihram´ _ (the attire of pilgrimage). The penance for anyone of you who hunts (during ´Ihram´) is an offering at the Kaaba similar to what was killed _ as judged by two just men among you. The atonement (for that act) is the feeding of the poor, or fasting for an equivalent number of days, so he may taste the consequence of his evil act. Allah forgives whatever has happened in the past, but He will exact retribution if anyone repeats (the offense). Allah is the most Powerful; He is the Lord of Revenge"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":96,"Text":"Lawful for you to hunt is the fish _ the game from the sea (or other bodies of water) to eat or to carry with the caravan.
