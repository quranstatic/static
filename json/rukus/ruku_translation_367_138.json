Do not enter the Prophet's homes unless you are given permission. When invited to dine, arrive not too early waiting for preparation of the meal. When you are invited, come at the appointed time, and when you have finished eating, disperse. Linger not in the quest of HADITH (vain talk). Behold, this might hurt the Prophet, and he would be shy to say so. But Allah is not shy of telling you what is Right. And if you ask something you need from the ladies (the household of the Prophet), ask them from behind the curtain. This is good for your hearts and for their hearts. (Respect of privacy is an essential component of mutual respect). It is not for you to hurt the Messenger, nor that you should ever marry his wives after him. Verily, this would be a great offense in the Sight of Allah. (They are their mothers)"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Whether you reveal anything or conceal it, verily, Allah is Knower of all things"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"There is no blame on women to relax their privacy with their fathers, their sons, their brothers, sons of their brothers, sons of their sisters, their womenfolk or their servants.
