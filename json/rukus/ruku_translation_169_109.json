They fight in God’s cause, and they kill or are killed. This is a promise with which God has bound Himself in the Torah and in the Gospel and in the Qur’an. Who could be more faithful to his covenant than God? So (O believers) glad tidings to you because of the bargain you have made with Him! That indeed is the supreme triumph"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":112,"Text":"Those who return in repentance to God, and those who worship God, and those who praise God, and those who travel (with such aims as conveying God’s Message or studying and making investigations for God’s sake or reflecting on God’s signs), and those who bow down in awe of God, and those who prostrate themselves before God in submission, and those who enjoin and promote what is right and good and forbid and try to prevent evil, and those who keep to the bounds set by God: give glad tidings to the believers"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":113,"Text":"It is not for the Prophet and those who believe to ask God for the forgiveness of those who associate partners with God even though they be near of kin, after it has become clear to them that they (died polytheists and therefore) are condemned to the Blazing Flame"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":114,"Text":"The prayer of Abraham for the forgiveness of his father was only because of a promise which he had made to him.
