Anyone who kills a believer by mistake should free a believing slave and pay blood money to the victim's relatives unless they forego it as an act of charity. If the victim belongs to a people at war with you, but is a believer, then the compensation is to free a believing slave. If he belongs to a people with whom you have a treaty, then blood-money should be handed over to his relatives and a believing slave set free. Anyone who lacks the means must fast for two consecutive months. Such is the penance imposed by God. God is all knowing and wise"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":93,"Text":"If anyone kills a believer deliberately, his reward shall be eternal Hell. God will condemn him and reject him, and prepare for him a terrible punishment"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":94,"Text":"Believers, when you go forth in the cause of God, make due investigation and do not say to those who offer you the greeting of peace, \"You are no believer!\" because you seek the good things of this life. With God there are good things in plenty. You yourself were in the same position before, but God conferred His special favour on you. Therefore, take care to investigate. Surely God is well-aware of what you do"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":95,"Text":"Those believers who stay behind, apart from those forced by necessity, are not equal to those who strive hard in God's cause with their possessions and their persons. God has given those who strive with their goods and their persons a higher rank than those who stayed behind. God has promised all a good reward; but far greater is the recompense of those who strive for Him"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":96,"Text":"high ranks conferred by Him as well as forgiveness and mercy. God is forgiving and merciful"}]}
