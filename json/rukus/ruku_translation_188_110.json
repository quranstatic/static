He raised you from the earth and made it the world you live on. Therefore, invoke His forgiveness and in lowliest plight stand repentant to Him of the way you conduct yourselves in life. Allah, my Creator, is indeed in the immediate proximity of the whole and of all in all and He responds to invocation"},{"SurahNumber":11,"VerseNumber":62,"Text":"But they said to him: \"O Saleh, you have been thus far the hope that sprang eternal in our breasts, but we seem to be staking our very future on some dark hope. Do you want us to renounce the system of faith and worship adopted by our fathers! Indeed we question the validity of what you induce us to do and we think it excites suspicion"},{"SurahNumber":11,"VerseNumber":63,"Text":"There did Saleh say: \" My people, pause here and think and think but this: what if Allah has enlightened my thoughts and my innermost being and imparted to me knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light and extended His mercy to me! Then, how can I neglect the duty of relating His message to the people when it has been entrusted to me. This shall be disobedience\". \"if I am to disobey Allah, who then can save me from His punishment!\" \"You people are simply trying to lead me into error and make me lose my way and incur privation of Allah's mercy"},{"SurahNumber":11,"VerseNumber":64,"Text":"My people\", he added, \"this is the she -camel of Allah, representing a distinct sign symbolic of the truth of my mission.

There, they were reduced to a useless form laying prostrate and dead under the ruins of their demolished homes"},{"SurahNumber":11,"VerseNumber":68,"Text":"Devastating was the blast and irretrievable was the disaster that they -the Thamudites- looked as if they never dwelt nor flourished whereat they perished.
