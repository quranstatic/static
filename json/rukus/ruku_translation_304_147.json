That will be the better for you, so that you may be heedful"},{"SurahNumber":24,"VerseNumber":28,"Text":"If you find no one at home, do not go in until permission has been granted you. If you are told to go away, then go away. That is more proper for you.

If any of your slaves desire a deed of freedom, write it out for them, if you find any promise in them, and give them some of the wealth God has given you. Do not force your [slave] maids into prostitution, in order to enrich yourself, when they wish to preserve their chastity. Yet if anyone forces them, once they have been forced, God will be forgiving and merciful to them"},{"SurahNumber":24,"VerseNumber":34,"Text":"We have sent down clear revelations to you and the example of those who passed away before you and an admonition for the God-fearing"}]}
