You did not think that they would leave their homes and they thought that their fortresses would save them from God. The decree of God came upon them in a way that even they did not expect.

People of vision, learn from this a lesson"},{"SurahNumber":59,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Had God not decreed exile for them, He would have certainly punished them (in some other way).

These people are the truthful ones"},{"SurahNumber":59,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"Those who established a community center and embraced the faith before the arrival of the immigrants love those who have come to their town.
