His light is beyond all comparison, (to be perceived by the human mind), it may be likened to the radiance emitting from a lustrous recess where a lamp stands enclosed in a glass tube or encased in glass featuring extraordinary brilliance as if it were an extra ordinary bright star lit by spiritual invisible combustion from a blessed tree, an olive tree (an ancient emblem of peace) standing in the open, never lost to view. It is not confined to the east nor to the west. Its oil almost emits light although not touched by a flame. Majestic light superimposed upon splendorous light attendant upon a manifestation of Allah Who attracts to His spiritual light whom He will, and Allah discourses to people parables by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set forth, and He is 'Alimun of all things"},{"SurahNumber":24,"VerseNumber":36,"Text":"In these sacred houses of prayer which Allah had ordained be erected, remembrance applies to Him whose praises are celebrated and whose attributes are extolled morning and evening"},{"SurahNumber":24,"VerseNumber":37,"Text":"By people whose feet are irresistibly drawn to these sacred places by the invisible and spiritual magnetic influence, people who are not distracted by trade or traffic from applying their remembrance to Allah. Nor are they distracted from religious observances, namely the act of worship alms giving, and holding in awe the Day of Judgement when the hearts sink -connoting extreme fear- and the eyes roll toward all and weep at what they are glad of or afraid of"},{"SurahNumber":24,"VerseNumber":38,"Text":"By consequence shall Allah requite them for every deed at the gauge of the best of what they had accomplished and shall make all grace abound in them, Allah provides livelihood and fits out meritoriously and/ or gratuitously whom He will with what He will and with what is necessary for a certain purpose"},{"SurahNumber":24,"VerseNumber":39,"Text":"As for those who deny Allah and do not acknowledge His Messengers' missions, their hopes shall be doomed to disappointment. Their deeds shall avail them nothing but the frustration or non-fulfillment of expectation, a situation standing similitude exact of a mirage* falsely viewed by the parched and thirsty traveler as water, and when he reaches the spot in question his hopes are doomed to disappointment. He finds what is known to be at variance with fact, an optical illusion. But he finds Allah, the Omnipresent, the truth personified, Who requites him with what is commensurate with his deeds, and Allah is swift indeed in putting the law in execution"},{"SurahNumber":24,"VerseNumber":40,"Text":"Or a world of darkness similar to that found in the depth of an ocean where billowy waves are superimposed upon billowy waves topped by dark clouds creating a coat of darkness superimposed upon coats of darkness where he sits or moves misted with darkness that if he stretches his hand he can hardly see it*. And he whom Allah blinds his mind's eyes and darkens his eyes shall he devoid of spiritual light and his hopes shall he doomed to disappointment"}]}
