Do not take as your intimate friends, anyone other than your own _ (the believers). The others _ (the unbelievers) _ spare no effort to corrupt you. They love to see you in trouble.

If you would only understand"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":119,"Text":"Here you are! You have love (and fondness) for them, but they do not love you at all, (even though) you believe in all the scriptures.
