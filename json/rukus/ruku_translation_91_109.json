Let them not grieve you who would rush in unbelief, as if competing with one another in a race, such of them as say with their mouths, \"We believe,\" but their hearts do not believe, and those of them who are Jews. They are eagerly listening out for falsehoods (especially about you) and eagerly listening out (spying) on behalf of other people who have never come to you (even to learn the essence of your Message); altering any words (whether pertaining to God or not) from their contexts to distort their meanings. They say (about matters referred to you for judgment): \"If such and such judgment is given to you, accept it; but if it is not given to you, then beware!\" Whoever God has willed to put to a trial (to prove his nature, and has failed in this trial), you have no power in anything on his behalf against God. Such are those whose hearts (because of their rushing in unbelief) God does not will to purify. For them is disgrace in the world, and in the Hereafter a tremendous punishment"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":42,"Text":"Listening out for lies and falsehood eagerly, and consuming unlawful earnings greedily! If they come to you (for judgment), you may either judge between them or turn away from them (and decline to give judgment). If you turn away from them, they cannot harm you in any way.

Surely God loves the scrupulously equitable"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":43,"Text":"But how is it that they ask you for judgment when they have the Torah, in which there is Godâ€™s judgment (concerning murder), and still thereafter turn away (from that and from your judgment)?
