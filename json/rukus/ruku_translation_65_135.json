This is Allah’s commandment to you. All women other than these are lawful for you to marry with your wealth in a legal marriage, not adultery. When you consummate your marriage with them, give them their due dowries. There is no sin on you to mutually agree after the [initial] agreement. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":25,"Text":"But if anyone of you cannot afford to marry free believing women, you may marry believing bondwomen in your possession. Allah knows best about your faith; you are from one another. Marry them with the permission of their masters and give them their dowries in fairness – provided that they are chaste, neither given to committing fornication nor having secret paramours. If they commit adultery after marriage, they are liable to half of the punishment prescribed for free women. This is for those of you who fear falling into sin; but if you stay patient, it is better for you. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"}]}
