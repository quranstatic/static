Do not come forward to (stand in) the Prayer while you are in (any sort of) state of drunkenness until you know what you are saying, nor while you are in the state of ritual impurity (requiring the total ablution) – save when you are on a journey (and then unable to bathe) – until you have bathed (done the total ablution). But if you are ill, or on a journey, or if any of you has just satisfied a call of nature, or you have had contact with women, and can find no water, then betake yourselves to pure earth, passing with it lightly over your face and hands (and forearms up to and including the elbows). Assuredly God is One Who grants remission, All-Forgiving"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":44,"Text":"Do you not see and reflect upon those who were given a portion from the Book? They are occupied with buying straying, and desire that you too should stray from the (right) way"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":45,"Text":"(O believers!) God knows best who your enemies are; and God suffices as Guardian and Protecting Friend, and God suffices as Helper"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":46,"Text":"Among those who have become Jews (Judaized) are some who alter the words from their context to distort their meanings, and say: \"We have heard and we disobey,\" and, \"Do hear us, may you turn dumb,\" (while pretending to say: \"Will you hearken to us, O respected one!\"), and \"Listen to us! May you become deaf, O shepherd!\" (while pretending to say: \"Attend to us!\") – thus making a malicious play with their tongues and seeking to revile the (True) Religion. Had they but said, \"We have heard and we obey,\" and \"Listen to us,\" and \"Favor us with your attention!\", it would indeed have been for their own good, and more upright. But God has excluded them from His mercy because of their (willful, persistent) unbelief, and, but for a few, scarcely do they believe"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":47,"Text":"O you who were given the Book (before)! Believe (sincerely) in (the whole of) what We have been sending down (on Muhammad), confirming what (of the truth) you already possess, before We obliterate faces so as to deprive them of seeing, hearing, speaking and smelling, or exclude them from Our mercy as We excluded the Sabbath-breakers. (Bear in mind that) God’s command is always executed"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":48,"Text":"Assuredly God does not forgive that partners be associated with Him; less than that He forgives to whomever He wills (whomever He has guided to repentance and righteousness either out of His pure grace or as a result of the person’s choosing repentance and righteousness by his free will). Whoever associates any partner with God has indeed fabricated a most heinous sin"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":49,"Text":"Do you (O Messenger) not consider those who regard themselves pure and sanctified? No! Rather, it is God Who makes pure and sanctifies whomever He wills (considering the free will of each), and none is wronged even by as much as a tiny hair"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":50,"Text":"Look! how they fabricate falsehood in attribution to God; and that suffices for a flagrant sin (to lead them to their perdition)"}]}
