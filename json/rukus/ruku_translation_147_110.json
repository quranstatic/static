He sent down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain - water to free you people from foreign matter as well as from moral and spiritual pollution and from the incitement of evil instigated by AL-Shaytan (Satan) and by those with characteristics befitting Him, and to do your hearts good and set your feet firm"},{"SurahNumber":8,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"There and then did Allah, your Creator, inspire the angels. Thus: \" I am acting with you\", Allah said: \"and so support the cause of those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and sustain them spiritually and help them take a firm position and set their feet firm\". \"I will inspire terror\", Allah added, \"in the hearts of those who are given to disbelief; strike them above the necks and strike their finger tips, their weak limbs and their failing joints"},{"SurahNumber":8,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"This train of events succeeding one another were occasioned on account of their hostility to Allah and to His Messenger; and he who is hostile to Allah and His Messenger shall realize that Allah punishes severely indeed"},{"SurahNumber":8,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"This is it you infidels, but that is not all; there awaits you the torment to be laid on the damned"},{"SurahNumber":8,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"O you who have conformed to Islam: \"If you happen to meet with the infidels -the enemy to your faith- and you see they are marshaled for fighting you, do not turn your backs upon them nor reverse your course or retreat"},{"SurahNumber":8,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"And he who turns his back, reverses his course or retreats, unless it be a stratagem for gaining advantage over the enemy or for falling back on other troops projected and directed as the larger military movement and operation of the campaign, will have come within the measure of Allah's wrath and be destined to the abode in Hell, and how evil is the destination"},{"SurahNumber":8,"VerseNumber":17,"Text":"You people must realize that it was not you who brought death upon the infidels but it was Allah Who destroyed them. It was not you O Muhammad who aimed when you spattered, but it was Allah Who directed the sand you hurled at your enemy. Nor was it you who deprived them of power when you threw the handful of sand at their faces, but it was Allah Who eclipsed their sight. Nonetheless, Allah has determined to test the quality of those who have conformed to Islam with gracious intentions; on the one hand with His prevenient grace producing the repentance and faith without which the grace of justification cannot be received and on the other hand with the efficacious grace really effecting the end for which it is given; Allah is indeed Sami'un (Omnipresent) with unlimited audition and 'Alimun (Omniscient)"},{"SurahNumber":8,"VerseNumber":18,"Text":"And so, this is it. Meantime Allah defies the infidels; He suspends their volition and renders their stratagem inefficient"},{"SurahNumber":8,"VerseNumber":19,"Text":"And you infidels, if you were looking for victory and judgement; your hopes have been doomed to disappointment; the Ka'ba belongs to those who have conformed to Islam. And if you exercise your faculty of volition toward peaceful existence and desist from the hostile course of action and your prudence gets the better of your pride, it would be to your advantage. But if your pride gets the better of your prudence and you resume hostilities, then the two sides shall inevitably meet again. And your troops, multitudinous as they will be, shall be of no advantage to you, for Allah upholds those whose hearts are faithful to Him"}]}
