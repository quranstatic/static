Truly, (a follower of) mine would be the one who avoids the taste of the water from the river, save a sip or two out of the hollow of his hand.\" But, except for a few, they all drank the water from the river. When Talut, and those who believed in him, crossed (the river), the others said, \"We do not have any strength left today against Goliath and his armies.\" Those who were certain about meeting their Lord, replied, \"How often has it been that a smaller group prevailed over a much larger group, by Allah´s leave?\" And Allah is certainly with the patient ones"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":250,"Text":"As they advanced to confront Goliath and his forces, they implored (Allah), \"Our Lord!

To some of them, Allah spoke (directly). He raised some to higher degrees (of honor) than others. We granted the manifest proofs to Jesus, son of Mary, and We strengthened him with the Holy Spirit _ (the angel Gibrael). Had Allah wished, those who followed the prophets, would not have fought each other, (especially) since they had seen the clear proofs. But they differed (and splintered into groups): some of them believed, while there were some of them who disbelieved. Had Allah wished, they would not have fought (each other). But Allah does what He wants"}]}
