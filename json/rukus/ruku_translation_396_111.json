So pay obedience to Allah as one who keeps Religion pure in relation to Him"},{"SurahNumber":39,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Be careful! The Religion in pristine purity is for Allah (i.e., it originates from Allah). And those who have picked up auliya besides Him (saying), 'we do not obey them except (for the sole purpose) that they may bring us near to Allah — (in) nearness,' surely Allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ.
