Do not enter houses other than your own houses, until you have asked and have been granted permission, and you have sent ‘salam’ (peace and blessing) unto their occupants; this is better for you in order that you may remind (yourself, and remind others). [This verse gives a start to the directions and admonitions to control and regulate the behaviour of the society. This counselling continues in many verses that follow. The wordings in this verse indicate that the incident of slander was cooked up on the basis of something which was noticed and misunderstood when a person entered in a house out of a sudden, without ashead of state permission of the inmates. Those who have not pondered over the Divine words have wrongly accepted another incident which was forged to malign the Last Prophet’s marital life]"},{"SurahNumber":24,"VerseNumber":28,"Text":"And if you do not find therein anyone, then do not enter it until the permission is granted for you. And if it is said to you: 'Go back’. Then you go back. That is more desirable of you.

And they shall not make evident their beauty except for their husbands or their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their own sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their own brothers, or the sons of their own brothers, or the sons of their own sisters, or their own women (i.e., who become their sisters in Islam and are not expected to betray them), or those whom their own right hands held in trust, or such of male employees as have no sexual appetite, or young children who have not become fully aware about the sexual areas of women. And they must not strike with their legs so that it may become known what they hide out of their beauty. And turn you to Allah — altogether, you Believers, so that you may prosper"},{"SurahNumber":24,"VerseNumber":32,"Text":"And arrange marriage for those amongst you who have become single after once remaining in a marital life (due to divorce or death of the marital partner), and (also arrange marriage for) the righteous amongst your males who are under your control and females who are under your control.

And those who seek a document (granting them independence) out of those whom your right hands held in trust — so write them (the document) if you knew in them good. And give them out of the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And compel not the females under your control towards undesirable state (of celibacy) — if they have decided protection (through a marriage-bond) — in order that you may seek the gain of the present life. And whoever compels them, then surely Allah, after their (coming under) compulsion will be Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful (to them)"},{"SurahNumber":24,"VerseNumber":34,"Text":"And surely, indeed We have sent down to you Ayaatin Mobayyinat and the example of those who passed away before you, and an admonition for the righteous"}]}
