They just (ape and) echo the words of the unbelievers of earlier times. Allah´s curse is upon them! How (easily) are they being deceived"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":31,"Text":"Instead of Allah they accepted their scholars, their monks, and (above all) Jesus son of Mary, to be their gods. In fact, they were commanded to worship (none but) the One (true) God. There is no god but He. Exalted is He, far above the partners they associate with Him"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":32,"Text":"They desire to snuff out the light of Allah huffing and puffing at it with their mouths _ (by uttering banalities) _ but Allah insists upon bringing His light to perfection, much to the chagrin of the unbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":33,"Text":"He it is, Who sent His messenger with (true) guidance for an ideal way of life, in order to make it prevail over all the other systems of belief, much to the dislike of the polytheists"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":34,"Text":"Oh you believers! In fact, a lot of rabbis and monks usurp the wealth of others wantonly, and with foul means. They turn people away from the path of Allah.

It was so ordained by Allah at the time when He created the heavens and the earth. Four of those months are sacred. Therefore, do not commit a sin against yourself (by violating the sanctity of these months). Fight against the ´mushriqeen´ _ (those who ascribe partners for Allah) _ on all fronts with unity in your ranks, just as they fight you. Be aware, that surely Allah is with the pious"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":37,"Text":"´Nasi´, (the postponement of the sacred months) is another instance (and example) of disbelief, (a practice) by which the unbelievers are led further astray. They deem a month ´not sacred´ one year and declare it to be sacred the next, in order to make up the numbers of sacred months (in a year). Thus, they (find a way to) legitimize what Allah has forbidden. Such an evil course seems pleasing to them. Allah does not guide the nation of unbelievers"}]}
