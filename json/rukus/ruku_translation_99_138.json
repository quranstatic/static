Ask not unnecessary details of the things as the Israelites did to Moses about the cow. This attitude may bring unpleasant consequences for you. But if you ask them as the Qur'an is being revealed, the minor details of Ordinances might be given which will be hard for you to follow. The general rule has been given that all pure and good things are Permissible to you. Your questions are very clearly answered in the Qur'an (5:15), (15:1), (22:40). Allah has absolved you in this respect for Allah is Forgiving, Clement. (The Qur'an is for all times, and while the basic Laws and Principles remain immutable, minor details are intended to be flexible according to temporal and spatial requirements (11:1). \"This day I have perfected your DEEN for you, completed My favor upon you, and chosen for you Islam as the System of Life"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":102,"Text":"Some folk before you asked such questions and then rejected the instructions"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":103,"Text":"Allah did not ordain that certain kinds of cattle and other livestock be marked out, assigned names, and set aside from human use or consumption.

O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! When death approaches you, two equitable persons among you should witness your will. If the pangs of death come upon you when you are traveling far from home, then two equitable persons other than your own people (non-Muslims) may do the witnessing. After you have prayed, let the witnesses swear by God, \"We shall not sell our word for any price, even though it is in favor of a relative, and we will not conceal what we have witnessed before God, or else we will be among the sinners"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":107,"Text":"If the witnesses commit this very violation, then let two others from among the nearest in kin take their place and swear by God, \"Our testimony (that we have heard from the deceased before) is truer than these two, and we have not transgressed the bounds of right, or else, may we indeed be counted among the transgressors"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":108,"Text":"This procedure will encourage an honest testimony to begin with.
