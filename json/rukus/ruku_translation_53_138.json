{"Id":138,"LanguageCodes":["en","eng"],"Name":"eng-shabbirahmed","Author":"Shabbir Ahmed","Language":"English","Description":"English","Direction":"ltr","Source":"","Translations":[{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":110,"Text":"Since you have been empowered by the Qur'an, you are the best suited Community that has been raised up for the good of mankind. It is your duty to enjoin the Right and forbid the Wrong, since you accept the Final Word of God as the Criterion (3:4). The Qur'an clearly educates you on the Permanent Moral Value System and decrees authoritatively what the otherwise vague terms of 'right' and 'wrong', and 'good' and 'evil' might mean. Now if the People of the Scripture had attained this kind of belief, it would have been for their own good. But only few among them are believers, while most of them are drifting away from the Truth"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":111,"Text":"If you truly become worthy of the title of \"The Best Suited Community\" your opponents would scarcely do a trifling harm and if they come to battle against you, they would flee quickly and find no help"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":112,"Text":"Humiliated are they wherever they may be, unless they grasp a bond with God, and a bond with the people. They have incurred displeasure of God, and are committed to disgrace. This is because they have been rejecting the Divine Revelations and have been opposing the Messengers of God, even wrongfully killing some of them. All this, because they rebelled, and persisted in transgressing the bounds of what is right"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":113,"Text":"Not all the People of the Scripture are alike. Among them are those who take a firm stand for the right cause, reflect upon the Revelations of Allah by night and fall in full submission"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":114,"Text":"They believe in Allah as the One True God, and in the Last Day. They advocate what Allah has decreed as virtuous, and forbid what Allah has decreed as vice. They try to lead in acts of social benefit; such are the ones who augment the human potential"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":115,"Text":"No benevolent actions of this kind shall go un-rewarded. Allah knows those who walk aright"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":116,"Text":"The wealth and children of the deniers will not avail them against Allah. They will end up in Hellfire to abide therein. (The punishment to humans is built in, in their actions. Allah is not like human tyrants who punish out of anger or displeasure (3:182), (4:111), (20:15), (7:)"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":117,"Text":"The likeness of what they spend in this life of the world is the likeness of a biting, frosty wind that destroys the harvest of a people who wronged their own \"Self\".

(They spent their wealth on themselves although it was a trust given to them to share with fellow human beings)"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":118,"Text":"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Do not take as intimates others than your own folk. They will do all they can to harm you. They love to see you in distress. Many of them have already voiced their hatred and what they hide in their chests is far worse. We thus clarify Our Commands for you so that you use your intellect"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":119,"Text":"You endear them though they endear you not. You believe in all the Scriptures. When they meet you they say, \" We believe as you believe\"; but as soon as they leave, they bite their fingers out of rage towards you. Say, \"Die in your rage.\" Allah is fully Aware of what is hidden in your hearts"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":120,"Text":"If something good happens to you, it grieves them but if a calamity befalls you, they rejoice at it. Remain steadfast and keep walking aright, and no amount of their plotting or cunning will harm you. Allah's Law Surrounds all that they do"}]}
