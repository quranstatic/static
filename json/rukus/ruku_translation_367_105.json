But when you are invited, feel free to enter, but once you have finished your meal, leave without making conversation. Such behavior annoys the Prophet. He is shy about asking you to leave, but God is not shy about telling you the truth, and when you ask them for something, ask them from behind a screen. That makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs, nor is it right for you to annoy God's messenger, nor should you marry his widows after him at any time. Truly such a thing is in God's sight an enormity"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Whether you reveal anything or conceal it, indeed God has full knowledge of all things"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"There is no blame on these women if they appear before their parents or their sons, their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sisters’ sons, or their maids, or those whom their right hands possess, but be conscious of God, for God is witness to all things"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":56,"Text":"God and His angels send blessings on the Prophet.
