If you yield to the disbelievers, they will drag you back to disbelief—and you will become losers"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":150,"Text":"But no! Allah is your Guardian, and He is the best Helper"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":151,"Text":"We will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers for associating ˹false gods˺ with Allah—a practice He has never authorized. The Fire will be their home—what an evil place for the wrongdoers to stay"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":152,"Text":"Indeed, Allah fulfilled His promise to you when you ˹initially˺ swept them away by His Will, then your courage weakened and you disputed about the command and disobeyed, after Allah had brought victory within your reach.

They say ˹to themselves˺, “If we had any say in the matter, none of us would have come to die here.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Even if you were to remain in your homes, those among you who were destined to be killed would have met the same fate.” Through this, Allah tests what is within you and purifies what is in your hearts.
