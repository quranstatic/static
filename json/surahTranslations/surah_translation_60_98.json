If you have come forth to strive in My Cause and to seek My good pleasure, then how can you show friendship to them in secret? I am aware of what you conceal and what you reveal. And whoever of you (Muslims) does that, then indeed has gone astray from the Right Way"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"If they gain the upper hand over you, they would behave to you as enemies and stretch out their hands and their tongues against you with evil, and they wish that you should become disbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"On the Day of Resurrection, neither your relatives nor your children will benefit you.
