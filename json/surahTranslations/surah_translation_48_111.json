Their marks (are evident) in their facies from the effect of the submissions. This (becomes) their example in At-Taurat, and (another) example for them in Al-Injeel: like a (sown) seed which sent out its shoot, then made it firm, then it became thick, then it stood (straight and stable) on its stem. (Now) it puts the sower to wonder — that He may enrage the disbelievers because of these (happy sowers).
