And Allah assesses the (utility of the) night and the day. He knew (beforehand) that you will never bear it (without getting over-tired), so He has turned to you in affection. So recite as became easy, out of Al-Qur‘an. He knew that soon there would be among you sick people, and others will travel through the earth, they will seek out of the Bounty of Allah; and (still) others will take part in Qital for the Cause of Allah. So recite as became easy out of it and establish As-Salat and pay-up Zakat, and lend to Allah Qarzan Hasanan. And whatever you send in advance for yourselves in the form of Khair (commendable deeds), you will find it with Allah; it (will be) something extremely good and greater as a reward. And seek Forgiveness from Allah. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"}]}
