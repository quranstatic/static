They are all irrigated with the same water, yet We make some taste better than others. Surely in this are signs for those who understand"},{"SurahNumber":13,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"˹Now,˺ if anything should amaze you ˹O Prophet˺, then it is their question: “When we are reduced to dust, will we really be raised as a new creation?” It is they who have disbelieved in their Lord.

The currents then carry along rising foam, similar to the slag produced from metal that people melt in the fire for ornaments or tools. This is how Allah compares truth to falsehood.

This is how Allah sets forth parables"},{"SurahNumber":13,"VerseNumber":18,"Text":"Those who respond to ˹the call of˺ their Lord will have the finest reward. As for those who do not respond to Him, even if they were to possess everything in the world twice over, they would certainly offer it to ransom themselves.

And how ˹horrible˺ was My punishment"},{"SurahNumber":13,"VerseNumber":33,"Text":"Is ˹there any equal to˺ the Vigilant One Who knows what every soul commits? Yet the pagans have associated others with Allah ˹in worship˺. Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Name them! Or do you ˹mean to˺ inform Him of something He does not know on the earth? Or are these ˹gods˺ just empty words?” In fact, the disbelievers’ falsehood has been made so appealing to them that they have been turned away from the Path.
