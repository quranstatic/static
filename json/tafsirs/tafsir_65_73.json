And this includes his community. (When ye (men) put away women) He says: tell your people, when you want to divorce women, (put them away for their (legal) period) divorce them when they become pure from their menses and they have not had sexual intercourse with them (and reckon the period) reckon their periods of purity following three periods of menstruation which are followed by major ritual ablution which, for this denotes the end of the waiting period (and keep your duty to Allah) and fear Allah, (your Lord) and do not divorce them when they are not ritually pure, as this goes against the prophetic practice. (Expel them not from their houses) where the divorce has taken place until the waiting period is over (nor let them go forth) until the elapse of the waiting period (unless they commit open immorality) unless they commit an evident sin, i.e. going out during the waiting period without her husbands' permission. Thus, expelling them from their homes during the waiting period is a sin and their going out in their waiting period is also a sin; it is also said that (unless they commit open immorality) means: unless they commit an act of adultery witnessed by four people, in which case they should be stoned. (Such are the limits (imposed by) Allah) these are the legal rulings and obligations of Allah about women regarding expenditure and lodgement; (and whoso transgresseth Allah's limits) and whoever transgresses Allah's legal rulings and obligations and that which He has commanded regarding expenditure and lodgement, (he verily wrongeth his soul) he harms his own person. (Thou knowest not) i.e. the husband does not know: (it may be that Allah will afterward) after the first pronouncement of divorce and before the end of the waiting period (bring some new thing to pass) i.e. love between the husband and wife and return to each other."},{"SurahNumber":65,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"(Then, when they have reached their term) when the waiting period is over, before having major ritual ablution, after the end of the third period of menstruation, (take them back in kindness) before they have major ritual ablution after the third period of menstruation, and then they should be treated with kindness (or part from them in kindness) do not prolong their waiting period, and give them all their rights, (and call to witness) both for divorcing them and taking them back (two just men among you) two free, upright, Muslim men, (and keep your testimony upright for Allah) and give your testimony before the judges for Allah's sake. (Whoso believeth in Allah and the Last) resurrection after death (is exhorted) believes (to act thus) i.e. regarding the expenditure, lodgement and delivering testimony. It is said that from the beginning of the surah up to here was revealed about the Prophet (pbuh) when he divorced Hafsah, and also about six prophetic Companions, among whom was Ibn 'Umar, who divorced their wives when they were in their periods, and so Allah forbade them from doing so, because it does not comply with the prophetic practice of divorce, and taught them about the latter. (And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah) upon committing a transgression and remain steadfast, (Allah will appoint a way out for him) from hardship; it is also said that this means: He will appoint a way out for him from transgression to acts of obedience; it is also said this means: from the Fire into Paradise,"},{"SurahNumber":65,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"(And will provide for him from (a quarter) whence he hath no expectation) this was revealed about 'Awf Ibn Malik al-Ashja'i whose son was captured by the enemy, and who returned later on to his family bringing with him many camels. (And whosoever putteth his trust in Allah) and whoever relies on Allah regarding provision, (He will suffice him. Lo! Allah bringeth His command to pass) His command and decree will come to pass in times of both comfort and hardship; it is also said this means: His command and providence will come to pass. (Allah hath set a measure) an appointed term (for all things) for both comfort and hardship. When Allah explained the waiting period of women who are divorced, Mu'adh stood up and said: O Messenger of Allah! What is the waiting period for those women who despair of menstruation?"},{"SurahNumber":65,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"(And for such of your women as despair of menstruation) because of old age, (if ye doubt) about their waiting period, (their period (of waiting) shall be three months) upon which another man asked: O Messenger of Allah! What about the waiting period of those who do not have menstruation because they are too young? (along with those who have it not) because of young age, their waiting period is three months. Another man asked: what is the waiting period for those women who are pregnant? (And for those with child) i.e. those who are pregnant, (their period) their waiting period (shall be till they bring forth their burden) their child. (And whosoever keepeth his duty to Allah) and whoever fears Allah regarding what he commands him, (He maketh his course easy for him) He makes his matter easy; and it is also said this means: He will help him to worship Him well."},{"SurahNumber":65,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"(That is the commandment of Allah) these are the legal rulings and obligations of Allah (which He revealeth unto you) which He explains to you in the Qur'an.

(And if they are with child) and if the women you divorce are pregnant, (then spend for them) i.e. the husbands should spend for them (till they bring forth their burden) until they give birth to their child. (Then, if they give suck for you) if the mother breastfeeds a child of yours, (give them) i.e. the mothers (their due payment) for breastfeeding (and consult together in kindness) the husband should spend on the mother without stinginess or spendthriftness; (but if ye make difficulties for one another) i.e. regarding expenditure and the mother refuses to breastfeed the child, (then let some other woman give suck for him (the father of the child)) then another woman, other than the mother, should be sought to breastfeed the child."},{"SurahNumber":65,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"(Let him) i.e. the father, (who hath abundance) who is well off (spend of his abundance) according to his wealth, (and he whose provision is measured) and he whose livelihood is tight, (let him spend) on breastfeeding (of that which Allah hath given him) according to what Allah has given him. (Allah asketh naught of any soul) regarding payment for breastfeeding (save that which He hath given it) save according to what he has given it of wealth. (Allah will vouchsafe, after hardship) in expenditure, (ease) after poverty there will be richness, for the one who suffers hardship of living awaits provision from Allah."},{"SurahNumber":65,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"(And how many a community) how many people of a community (revolted against the ordinance of its Lord) transgressed and refused to obey the commands of their Lord (and His messenger) and rejected the messengers and the messages they brought to them, (and we called it to a stern account) in the Hereafter (and punished it) in the life of the world (with dire punishment) with severe punishment,"},{"SurahNumber":65,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"(So that it tasted the ill effects of its conduct) it tasted the punishment of its course in the life of the world through being destroyed, (and the consequence of its conduct) in the Hereafter (was loss) will be loss."},{"SurahNumber":65,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"(Allah hath prepared for them) in the Hereafter (stern punishment) an intense punishment, one kind of punishment after the other; (so keep your duty to Allah) so fear Allah, (O men of understanding) O you who possess intellect among people!
