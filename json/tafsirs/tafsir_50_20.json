It was only in later times that people readily accepted their status as prophets. The reason for this is that the prophet appears to his contemporaries as ‘a person just like themselves’. They find it surprising that one whom they have always treated as their equal should suddenly become great and start advising them. But, as time passes, a history of greatness becomes attached to the prophet’s name. So, he starts appearing to succeeding generations as a ‘person greater than themselves.’ That is why, in later periods people did not find it difficult to accept the prophetic status of a prophet. In other words, to the people of the early days, the prophet was a controversial figure, while to the people of later times he acquired the aura of an established personage. The people of the earlier period had to undertake a journey in consciousness in order to fill the gap between them and the prophet, while in the later period, this gap would have been filled by history itself. In the eyes of those who entertain doubts about the prophethood of God’s messenger, everything about him becomes doubtful—even those beliefs that are already enshrined in tradition. However, nothing can act as a shield or an excuse for the doubters. If the rejecters of the prophet were simply to consider the inimitable literary majesty of his book, they would be compelled to accept as a prophet the one who brought that book."},{"SurahNumber":50,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"The history of the prophets shows that their contemporaries were not ready to accept them.

On the other hand, it has been stated in the Quran on more than one occasion that, through him, the Prophet Muhammad, God would cause the religion of Truth to prevail over all other religions. These two statements, in fact, relate to different aspects of the Prophet Muhammad. From one aspect, he was the messenger of God. From another aspect, he was the ‘last of the prophets.’ As a messenger of God, his mission was the same as that of all other prophets, namely, to convey the Truth to the people in a proper manner. But, as he was the last of the prophets, it was the intention of Almighty God to create such conditions through him that the word of God should remain preserved for all eternity, so that there should be no necessity to send any further prophets. This second aspect of the Prophet necessitated that, through him, a revolution be brought about which should end the dominance of polytheism, thereby establishing Islam as a dominant force which would guarantee the continuance of Divine guidance forever."}]}
