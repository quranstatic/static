There are those people whose souls the angels remove with ease, as if they were unraveling him (i.e., his soul from him) due to their briskness. This is the meaning of Allah's statement,\nوَالنَّـشِطَـتِ نَشْطاً\n(By those who free briskly.) This has been mentioned by Ibn `Abbas. In reference to Allah's statement,\nوَالسَّـبِحَـتِ سَبْحاً\n(And by the swimmers, swimming.) Ibn Mas`ud said, \"They are the angels.\" Similar statements have been reported from `Ali, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, and Abu Salih. Concerning Allah's statement,\nفَالسَّـبِقَـتِ سَبْقاً\n(And by the racers, racing.) It has been narrated from `Ali, Masruq, Mujahid, Abu Salih, and Al-Hasan Al-Basri that this means the angels. Then Allah says,\nفَالْمُدَبِّرَتِ أَمْراً\n(And by those who arrange affairs.) `Ali, Mujahid, `Ata', Abu Salih, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, and As-Suddi all said, \"They are the angels.\" Al-Hasan added, \"They control the affairs from the heaven to the earth, meaning by the command of their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.\"\nThe Description of the Day of Judgement, the People, and what They will say\nThen Allah says,\nيَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الرَّاجِفَةُ - تَتْبَعُهَا الرَّادِفَةُ\n(On the Day the Rajifah shakes, followed by the Radifah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"These are the two blasts (of the Trumpet) -- the first and the second.\" Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others have made similar statements. It has been reported from Mujahid that he said, \"In reference to the first, it is the statement of Allah,\nيَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الرَّاجِفَةُ\n(On the Day the Rajifah shakes,) This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الاٌّرْضُ وَالْجِبَالُ\n(On the Day the earth and the mountains shake.) (73:14) The second is Ar-Radifah, and it is like the Allah's statement,\nوَحُمِلَتِ الاٌّرْضُ وَالْجِبَالُ فَدُكَّتَا دَكَّةً وَحِدَةً\n(And the earth and mountains shall be removed from their places, and crushed with a single crushing.) (69:14)\" Concerning Allah's statement,\nقُلُوبٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَاجِفَةٌ\n(Hearts that Day will tremble.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means afraid.\" Mujahid and Qatadah also said this.\nأَبْصَـرُهَا خَـشِعَةٌ\n(Their vision humiliated.) meaning, the eyes of the people. It means that the eyes will be lowly and disgraced from what they will witness of terrors. Allah then says,\nيَقُولُونَ أَءِنَّا لَمَرْدُودُونَ فِى الْحَـفِرَةِ\n(They say: \"Shall we indeed be brought back from Al-Hafirah\") meaning, the idolators of the Quraysh and whoever rejects the Hereafter as they did. They consider the occurrence of the resurrection after being placed in Al-Hafirah -- which are the graves -- as something farfetched. This has been said by Mujahid. They feel that this is something impossible after the destruction of their physical bodies and the disintegration of their bones and their decaying. Thus, Allah says,\nأَءِذَا كُنَّا عِظَـماً نَّخِرَةً\n(Even after we are bones Nakhirah) It has also been recited: (نَاخِرَةً) (Nakhirah) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah, all said, \"This means decayed.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"It is the bone when it has decayed and air enters into it.\" Concerning their saying,\nتِلْكَ إِذاً كَرَّةٌ خَـسِرَةٌ\n(It would in that case be a return with loss.) (79:12) Muhammad bin Ka`b said that the Quraysh said, \"If Allah brings us back to life after we die, then surely we will be losers.\" Allah then says,\nفَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ - فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ\n(But it will be only a single Zajrah. When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) meaning, this is a matter that is from Allah that will not occur twice, nor will there be any opportunity to affirm it or verify it. The people will be standing and looking. This will be when Allah commands the angel Israfil to blow into the Sur, which will be the blowing of the resurrection. At that time the first people and the last people will all be standing before their Lord looking. This is as Allah says,\nيَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً\n(On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praise and obedience, and you will think that you have stayed but a little while!) (17:52) Allah has also said,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ\n(And our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) (54:50) Allah also says,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُ السَّاعَةِ إِلاَّ كَلَمْحِ الْبَصَرِ أَوْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ\n(And the matter of the Hour is not but as a twinkling of the eye, or even nearer.) (16:77) Allah then says,\nفَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ\n(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"As-Sahirah means the entire earth.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and Abu Salih have all said this as well. `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Zayd have all said, \"As-Sahirah means the face of the earth.\" Mujahid said, \"They will be at its (the earth's) lowest part, and they will be brought out to highest part.\" Then he said, \"As-Sahirah is a level place.\" Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said,\nفَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ\n(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) \"Allah says,\nيَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:48) and He says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً - فَيَذَرُهَا قَاعاً صَفْصَفاً - لاَّ تَرَى فِيهَا عِوَجاً وَلا أَمْتاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust. Then He shall leave them as a level smooth plain.You will see therein nothing crooked or curved.) (20:105-107) and Allah says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً\n(And the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away, and you will see the earth as a leveled plain.) (18:47) and the earth will be brought forth which will have mountains upon it, and it will not be considered from this earth (of this life). It will be an earth that no sin will be performed on it, nor will any blood be shed upon it.\""},{"SurahNumber":79,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"The Tafsir of Surat An-Nazi`at (Chapter - 79) Which was revealed in Makkah\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nSwearing by Five Characteristics that the Day of Judgement will occur\nIbn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Salih, Abu Ad-Duha and As-Suddi all said,\nوَالنَّـزِعَـتِ غَرْقاً\n(By those who pull out, drowning.) \"These are the angels who remove the souls from the Children of Adam.\" Among them are those whose souls are removed by the angels with difficulty, as if he is being drowned during its removal.

Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means afraid.\" Mujahid and Qatadah also said this.\nأَبْصَـرُهَا خَـشِعَةٌ\n(Their vision humiliated.) meaning, the eyes of the people. It means that the eyes will be lowly and disgraced from what they will witness of terrors. Allah then says,\nيَقُولُونَ أَءِنَّا لَمَرْدُودُونَ فِى الْحَـفِرَةِ\n(They say: \"Shall we indeed be brought back from Al-Hafirah\") meaning, the idolators of the Quraysh and whoever rejects the Hereafter as they did. They consider the occurrence of the resurrection after being placed in Al-Hafirah -- which are the graves -- as something farfetched. This has been said by Mujahid. They feel that this is something impossible after the destruction of their physical bodies and the disintegration of their bones and their decaying. Thus, Allah says,\nأَءِذَا كُنَّا عِظَـماً نَّخِرَةً\n(Even after we are bones Nakhirah) It has also been recited: (نَاخِرَةً) (Nakhirah) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah, all said, \"This means decayed.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"It is the bone when it has decayed and air enters into it.\" Concerning their saying,\nتِلْكَ إِذاً كَرَّةٌ خَـسِرَةٌ\n(It would in that case be a return with loss.) (79:12) Muhammad bin Ka`b said that the Quraysh said, \"If Allah brings us back to life after we die, then surely we will be losers.\" Allah then says,\nفَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ - فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ\n(But it will be only a single Zajrah. When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) meaning, this is a matter that is from Allah that will not occur twice, nor will there be any opportunity to affirm it or verify it. The people will be standing and looking. This will be when Allah commands the angel Israfil to blow into the Sur, which will be the blowing of the resurrection. At that time the first people and the last people will all be standing before their Lord looking. This is as Allah says,\nيَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً\n(On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praise and obedience, and you will think that you have stayed but a little while!) (17:52) Allah has also said,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ\n(And our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) (54:50) Allah also says,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُ السَّاعَةِ إِلاَّ كَلَمْحِ الْبَصَرِ أَوْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ\n(And the matter of the Hour is not but as a twinkling of the eye, or even nearer.) (16:77) Allah then says,\nفَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ\n(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"As-Sahirah means the entire earth.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and Abu Salih have all said this as well. `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Zayd have all said, \"As-Sahirah means the face of the earth.\" Mujahid said, \"They will be at its (the earth's) lowest part, and they will be brought out to highest part.\" Then he said, \"As-Sahirah is a level place.\" Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said,\nفَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ\n(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) \"Allah says,\nيَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:48) and He says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً - فَيَذَرُهَا قَاعاً صَفْصَفاً - لاَّ تَرَى فِيهَا عِوَجاً وَلا أَمْتاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.

It means that the eyes will be lowly and disgraced from what they will witness of terrors. Allah then says,\nيَقُولُونَ أَءِنَّا لَمَرْدُودُونَ فِى الْحَـفِرَةِ\n(They say: \"Shall we indeed be brought back from Al-Hafirah\") meaning, the idolators of the Quraysh and whoever rejects the Hereafter as they did. They consider the occurrence of the resurrection after being placed in Al-Hafirah -- which are the graves -- as something farfetched. This has been said by Mujahid. They feel that this is something impossible after the destruction of their physical bodies and the disintegration of their bones and their decaying. Thus, Allah says,\nأَءِذَا كُنَّا عِظَـماً نَّخِرَةً\n(Even after we are bones Nakhirah) It has also been recited: (نَاخِرَةً) (Nakhirah) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah, all said, \"This means decayed.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"It is the bone when it has decayed and air enters into it.\" Concerning their saying,\nتِلْكَ إِذاً كَرَّةٌ خَـسِرَةٌ\n(It would in that case be a return with loss.) (79:12) Muhammad bin Ka`b said that the Quraysh said, \"If Allah brings us back to life after we die, then surely we will be losers.\" Allah then says,\nفَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ - فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ\n(But it will be only a single Zajrah. When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) meaning, this is a matter that is from Allah that will not occur twice, nor will there be any opportunity to affirm it or verify it. The people will be standing and looking. This will be when Allah commands the angel Israfil to blow into the Sur, which will be the blowing of the resurrection. At that time the first people and the last people will all be standing before their Lord looking. This is as Allah says,\nيَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً\n(On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praise and obedience, and you will think that you have stayed but a little while!) (17:52) Allah has also said,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ\n(And our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) (54:50) Allah also says,\nوَمَآ أَمْرُ السَّاعَةِ إِلاَّ كَلَمْحِ الْبَصَرِ أَوْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ\n(And the matter of the Hour is not but as a twinkling of the eye, or even nearer.) (16:77) Allah then says,\nفَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ\n(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"As-Sahirah means the entire earth.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and Abu Salih have all said this as well. `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Zayd have all said, \"As-Sahirah means the face of the earth.\" Mujahid said, \"They will be at its (the earth's) lowest part, and they will be brought out to highest part.\" Then he said, \"As-Sahirah is a level place.\" Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said,\nفَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ\n(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) \"Allah says,\nيَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:48) and He says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً - فَيَذَرُهَا قَاعاً صَفْصَفاً - لاَّ تَرَى فِيهَا عِوَجاً وَلا أَمْتاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust. Then He shall leave them as a level smooth plain.You will see therein nothing crooked or curved.) (20:105-107) and Allah says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً\n(And the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away, and you will see the earth as a leveled plain.) (18:47) and the earth will be brought forth which will have mountains upon it, and it will not be considered from this earth (of this life). It will be an earth that no sin will be performed on it, nor will any blood be shed upon it.\""},{"SurahNumber":79,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Mentioning the Story of Musa and that it is a Lesson for Those Who fear Allah\nAllah informs His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ about His Messenger Musa.

(28:41) Allah said;\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَى\n(In this is a lesson for whoever fears.)"},{"SurahNumber":79,"VerseNumber":26,"Text":"Mentioning the Story of Musa and that it is a Lesson for Those Who fear Allah\nAllah informs His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ about His Messenger Musa. He mentions that he sent Musa to Fir`awn and He aided him with miracles. Yet, even after this, Fir`awn continued in his disbelief and transgression until Allah seized him with a mighty and powerful punishment. Thus is the punishment of whoever opposes you (Muhammad ﷺ) and rejects that which you have been sent with. This is why Allah says at the end of the story,\nإِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَى\n(In this is a Lesson for whoever fears.) Allah begins by saying,\nهَلْ أَتَاكَ حَدِيثُ مُوسَى\n(Has there come to you the story of Musa) meaning, have you heard of his story\nإِذْ نَادَاهُ رَبُّهُ\n(When his Lord called him) meaning, He called out speaking to him.\nبِالْوَادِ الْمُقَدَّسِ\n(in the holy valley) meaning purified\nطُوًى\n(Tuwa) According to what is correct, it is the name of a valley, as preceded in Surah Ta Ha. So, He said to him:\nاذْهَبْ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ طَغَى\n(Go to Fir`awn; verily, he has transgressed all bounds.) meaning, he has become haughty, rebellious and arrogant.\nفَقُلْ هَل لَّكَ إِلَى أَن تَزَكَّى\n(And say to him: \"Would you purify yourself\") meaning, say to him, \"Will you respond to the path and way that will purify you\" This means, `will you submit (accept Islam) and be obedient'\nوَأَهْدِيَكَ إِلَى رَبِّكَ\n(And that I guide to your Lord,) meaning, `I will guide you to the worship of your Lord.'\nفَتَخْشَى\n(so that you fear) meaning, `so that your heart will become humble, obedient, and submissive to Him after it was hard, evil, and far away from goodness.'\nفَأَرَاهُ الاٌّيَةَ الْكُبْرَى\n(Then he showed him the great sign.) This means that Musa showed him -- along with this truthful call -- a strong evidence and a clear proof of the truthfulness of what he had come up with from Allah.\nفَكَذَّبَ وَعَصَى\n(But he denied and disobeyed.) meaning, he (Fir`awn) rejected the truth and opposed what Musa commanded him with of obedience. So what happened with him was that his heart disbelieved, and Musa (i.e., his call) could not internally or externally affect it. Along with this, his knowledge that what Musa had come to him with was the truth, did not necessitate his being a believer in it. This is because recognition is the knowledge of the heart, and faith is its action. And it (faith) is to comply with the truth and submit to it.

He has granted them these beneficial things for the period that they need them, in this worldly abode, until the end of time and the expiration of this life."},{"SurahNumber":79,"VerseNumber":33,"Text":"Creating the Heavens and the Earth is more difficult than repeating Creation\nin refutation of the claim rejecting resurrection due to the renewal of creation after its original state, Allah says;\nءَأَنتُمْ\n(Are you) `O people'\nأَشَدُّ خَلْقاً أَمِ السَّمَآءُ\n(more difficult to create or is the heaven...) meaning, `rather the heaven is more difficult to create than you.' As Allah said;\nلَخَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ أَكْـبَرُ مِنْ خَلْقِ النَّاسِ\n(the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of mankind;) (40:57) And His saying;\nأَوَلَـيْسَ الَذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُم بَلَى وَهُوَ الْخَلَّـقُ الْعَلِيمُ\n(Is not the One Who created the heavens and the earth, capable of creating the similar to them. Yes, indeed! He is the Supreme Creator, the All-Knowing.) (36:81) Then Allah says,\nبَنَـهَا\n(He constructed) He explains this by His statement,\nرَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا\n(He raised its height, and has perfected it.) meaning, He made it a lofty structure, vast in its space, with equal sides, and adorned with stars at night and in the darkness. Then Allah says,\nوَأَغْطَشَ لَيْلَهَا وَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَـهَا\n(Its night He covers and He brings out its forenoon.) meaning, He made its night dark and extremely black, and its day bright, luminous, shining and clear. Ibn `Abbas said, \"He did Aghtasha of its night means that He made it dark.\" Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr and a large group have said this as well. In reference to Allah's statement,\nوَأَخْرَجَ ضُحَـهَا\n(And He brings out its forenoon.) meaning, He illuminated its day. Then Allah says,\nوَالاٌّرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ دَحَـهَا\n(And after that He spread the earth,) He explains this statement by the statement that follows it,\nأَخْرَجَ مِنْهَا مَآءَهَا وَمَرْعَـهَا\n(And brought forth therefrom its water and its pasture.) It already has been mentioned previously in Surat Ha Mim As-Sajdah that the earth was created before the heaven was created, but it was only spread out after the creation of the heaven. This means that He brought out what was in it with a forceful action. This is the meaning of what was said by Ibn `Abbas and others, and it was the explanation preferred by Ibn Jarir. In reference to the statement of Allah,\nوَالْجِبَالَ أَرْسَـهَا\n(And the mountains He has fixed firmly,) meaning, He settled them, made them firm, and established them in their places. And He is the Most Wise, the All-Knowing. He is Most Kind to His creation, Most Merciful. Allah then says,\nمَتَـعاً لَّكُمْ وَلاًّنْعَـمِكُمْ\n(As provision and benefit for you and your cattle.) meaning, He spread out the earth, caused its springs to gush forth, brought forth its hidden benefits, caused its rivers to flow, and caused its vegetation, trees, and fruits to grow. He also made its mountains firm so that it (the earth) would be calmly settled with its dwellers, and He stabilized its dwelling places. All of this is a means of beneficial enjoyment for His creatures (mankind) providing them of what cattle they need, which they eat and ride upon.
