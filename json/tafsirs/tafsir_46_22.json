And do not seek to hasten it for them for your people the sending down of the chastisement on them. Some say that he the Prophet seemed by this stage to have become exasperated because of them and desired that chastisement be sent down on them which is why he was enjoined to exercise patience and to refrain from hastening the chastisement for them — for it would befall them eventually without doubt.
