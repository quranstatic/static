You offer you communicate to them the Prophet’s plan s to attack them which he had confided to you and had kept secret at Hunayn communicating this to them out of affection between you and them. Hātib b. Abī Balta‘a sent them a letter to that effect on account of his having children and close relatives idolaters among them. The Prophet s intercepted it from the person to whom he Hātib had given it to deliver after God apprised him of this. Hātib’s excuse for this conduct of his was accepted by the Prophet; when verily they have disbelieved in the truth that has come to you that is in the religion of Islam and the Qur’ān expelling the Messenger and you from Mecca by oppressing you because you believe in God your Lord. If you have gone forth to struggle in My way and to seek My pleasure … the response to the conditional is indicated by what preceded that is to say understand it as being ‘then do not take them as friends’. You secretly harbour affection for them when I know well what you hide and what you proclaim. And whoever among you does that that is to secretly communicate the Prophet’s news to them has verily strayed from the right way he has missed the path of guidance originally al-sawā’ means ‘the middle way’."},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"If they were to prevail over you they would be your enemies and would stretch out against you their hands to kill and assault you and their tongues with evil intent with insults and reviling; and they long for you to disbelieve."},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Your relatives and your children the idolatrous ones for whose sake you secretly communicated the news will not avail you against the chastisement in the Hereafter. On the Day of Resurrection you will be separated passive yufsalu; or read active yafsilu ‘He will separate you’ from them so that you will be in Paradise while they will be alongside the disbelievers in the Fire. And God is Seer of what you do."},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"Verily there is for you a good example read iswa or uswa in both instances meaning qudwa in the person of Abraham in terms of his sayings and deeds and those who were with him of believers when they said to their people ‘We are indeed innocent of you bura’ā’ is the plural of barī’ similar in form to zarīf ‘charming’ and of what you worship besides God. We repudiate you we disavow you and between us and you there has arisen enmity and hate forever wa’l-baghdā’u abadan pronounce both hamzas fully or replace the second one with a wāw until you come to believe in God alone’ except for Abraham’s saying to his father ‘I shall ask forgiveness for you — this statement is excepted from ‘a good example’ so it is not right for you to follow his example in this respect by asking forgiveness for disbelievers. As for his saying but I cannot avail you anything against God’ — that is either against His chastisement or to secure for you of His reward — he Abraham is using it to intimate to his father that he can do nothing for him other than to ask forgiveness for him which saying is itself based on that former statement albeit excepted from it in terms of what is meant by it even if on the face of it it would seem to be semantically part of the good example to be followed Say ‘Who can avail you anything against God’ Q. 4811; his Abraham’s plea of forgiveness for him was before it became evident to him that he his father was an enemy of God as mentioned in sūrat Barā’a Q. 9114. ‘Our Lord in You we put our trust and to You we turn penitently and to You is the journeying these are the words of the Friend of God Abraham and those who were with him in other words they were saying"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"Our Lord do not make us a cause of beguilement for those who disbelieve that is to say do not make them prevail over us lest they think that they are following the truth and are beguiled as a result in other words lest they lose their reason because of us; and forgive us. Our Lord You are indeed the Mighty the Wise’ in Your kingdom and Your actions."},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"Verily there is for you O community of Muhammad (s) laqad kāna lakum is the response to an implied oath in them a good example for those of you who li-man kāna is an inclusive substitution for –kum of lakum ‘for you’ with the same preposition li- repeated anticipate God and the Last Day that is for those who fear these two or who expect reward or punishment. And whoever turns away by befriending the disbelievers should know that God is the Independent without need of His creatures the Worthy of Praise to those who obey Him."},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"It may be that God will bring about between you and those of them with whom you are at enmity from among the disbelievers of Mecca out of your obedience to God exalted be He affection by His guiding them to faith so that they then become your friends. For God is Powerful able to do that — and He did do this after the conquest of Mecca — and God is Forgiving to them of their past deeds Merciful to them also."},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"God does not forbid you in regard to those who did not wage war against you from among the disbelievers on account of religion and did not expel you from your homes that you should treat them kindly an tabarrūhum is an inclusive substitution for alladhīna ‘those who’ and deal with them justly this was revealed before the command to struggle against them.

God knows best the state of their faith. Then if you know them if you suppose them on the basis of their oaths to be believers do not send them back to the disbelievers. They the women are not lawful for them nor are they the disbelievers lawful for them. And give them that is to say their disbelieving husbands what they have expended on them on such women in the way of dowries. And you would not be at fault if you marry them on that previous condition when you have given them their dowries. And do not hold on read tumassikū or tumsikū to the conjugal ties of disbelieving women your wives for your Islam automatically prohibits you from this or to the ties of those apostatising women who return to the idolaters for likewise their apostatising automatically prohibits you from marrying them and ask for demand the return of what you have expended on these women of dowries in the event of apostasy from those disbelievers to whom they are married. And let them ask for what they have expended on those women who have emigrated as explained above that it may be repaid to them. That is God’s judgement. He judges between you therewith and God is Knower Wise."},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"And if you lose any of your wives that is to say if you lose one or more of them — or it means if you lose anything of their dowries — by their going to the disbelievers as apostates and so you retaliate you embark upon a raid and capture spoils from them then give those whose wives have gone from the spoils the like of what they have expended for their having lost it to the disbelievers. And fear God in Whom you believe. And indeed the believers did what they had been commanded to do in the way of paying back the disbelievers the dowries of their former wives and the believers the dowries of the women who had apostatised. Afterwards however this stipulation was annulled."},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"O Prophet if believing women come to you pledging allegiance to you that they will not ascribe anything as partner to God and that they will not steal nor commit adultery nor slay their children as used to be done during the time of pagandom jāhiliyya when they would bury new-born girls alive fearing ignominy and impoverishment nor bring any lie that they have invented originating between their hands and their legs that is by bringing a foundling which they then falsely ascribe to the husband — it the lie is described in terms of a real child because when a woman gives birth to a child it falls between her hands and legs; nor disobey you in doing what is decent which is that which concords with obedience to God such as refraining from wailing ripping apart their clothes in grief pulling out their hair tearing open the front of their garments or scratching their faces then accept their allegiance — the Prophet s did this but in words and he did not shake hands with any of them — and ask God to forgive them; surely God is Forgiving Merciful."},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"O you who believe do not befriend a people against whom God is wrathful namely the Jews. They have truly despaired of the Hereafter of attaining its reward — despite their being certain of its truth out of obstinacy towards the Prophet even though they know him to be sincere — just as the disbelievers have despaired — they themselves being — of those who are in the tombs that is to say those who are entombed and barred from the good of the Hereafter for they are shown both their would-have-been places in Paradise had they believed and the Fire for which they are destined."}]}
