Thus, Allah says,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا الْحُطَمَةُ - نَارُ اللَّهِ الْمُوقَدَةُ - الَّتِى تَطَّلِعُ عَلَى الاٌّفْئِدَةِ\n(And what will make you know what Al-Hutamah is The fire of Allah, Al-Muqadah, which leaps up over the hearts.) Thabit Al-Bunani said, \"It will burn them all the way to their hearts while they are still alive.\" Then he said, \"Indeed the torment will reach them.\" Then he cried. Muhammad bin Ka`b said, \"It (the Fire) will devour every part of his body until it reaches his heart and comes to the level of his throat, then it will return to his body.\"\nConcerning Allah's statement,\nإِنَّهَا عَلَيْهِم مُّؤْصَدَةٌ\n(Verily, it shall Mu'sadah upon them.) meaning, covering, just as was mentioned in the Tafsir of Surat Al-Balad (see 90:20). Then Allah says,\nفِى عَمَدٍ مُّمَدَّدَةِ\n(In pillars stretched forth. ) \"Atiyah Al-`Awfi said, \"Pillars of Iron.\" As-Suddi said, \"Made of fire.\" Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"He will make them enter pillars stretched forth, meaning there will be columns over them, and they will have chains on their necks, and the gates (of Hell) will be shut upon them.\" This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Humazah, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah."}]}
