Evil indeed is that which they are wont to do."},{"SurahNumber":63,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"That namely their evil deed is because they believed by affirming faith only with the tongue then disbelieved in their hearts that is to say they persist in harbouring disbelief in it; therefore their hearts have been stamped sealed with disbelief. Hence they do not understand faith."},{"SurahNumber":63,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"And when you see them their figures please you on account of their fairness; and if they speak you listen to their speech because of its eloquence. Yet they are by virtue of the enormous size of their figures yet in their lack of comprehension like blocks of timber read khushbun or khushubun that have been propped-up set reclining against a wall. They assume that every cry made like a battle-cry or one made to retrieve a lost camel is directed against them because of the extent of terror in their hearts lest something should be revealed deeming their blood licit. They are the enemy so beware of them for they communicate your secrets to the disbelievers. May God assail them! destroy them! How can they deviate? how can they be turned away from faith after the proofs for it have been established?"},{"SurahNumber":63,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"And when it is said to them ‘Come offer apologies and God’s Messenger will ask forgiveness for you’ they twist read lawwaw or lawū they turn their heads and you see them turning away rejecting this offer disdainful."},{"SurahNumber":63,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"It will be the same for them whether you ask forgiveness for them a’staghfarta the interrogative hamza here has taken the place of the conjunctive hamza or do not ask forgiveness for them God will never forgive them. Indeed God does not guide the immoral folk."},{"SurahNumber":63,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"They are the ones who say to their companions from among the Helpers ‘Do not expend on those who are with the Messenger of God from among the Emigrants until they scatter off’ until they part with him. Yet to God belong the treasuries of the heavens and the earth with what they contain of provision and so He is the provider for the Emigrants and others but the hypocrites do not understand."},{"SurahNumber":63,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"They say ‘Surely if we return from the raid against the Banū al-Mustaliq to Medina the powerful by which they meant themselves will soon expel from it the weaker’ by which they meant the believers. Yet the real might victory belongs to God and to His Messenger and to the believers but the hypocrites do not know that."},{"SurahNumber":63,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"O you who believe do not let your possessions and your children divert you distract you from the remembrance of God from the five prayers; for whoever does that — it is they who are the losers."},{"SurahNumber":63,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"And expend in alms of that with which We have provided you before death comes to any of you whereat he will say ‘My Lord if only law-lā means hal-lā ‘why do You not’; or the lā is extra and the law is optative You would reprieve me for a short time so that I might give charity assaddaq the original tā’ of atasaddaqa has been assimilated with the sād that I might offer alms and become one of the righteous!’ by making the Pilgrimage. Ibn ‘Abbās may God be pleased with both him and his father said ‘Every person who has fallen short of his duty regarding alms and the Pilgrimage will ask to be returned to this world at the moment of death’."},{"SurahNumber":63,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"But God will never reprieve a soul when its term has come.
