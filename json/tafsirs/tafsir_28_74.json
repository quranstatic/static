So the one who was of his faction called to him for help against the one who was of his enemies and so Moses said to him ‘Leave him be!’ and it is said that he replied to Moses thus ‘I am truly considering making you carry this firewood!’.

You merely want to be a tyrant in the land and you do not want to be of the reformers’. The Egyptian heard this and realised that the slayer had been Moses. Thus he hurried off to Pharaoh to inform him of this.

The two women returned to their father quicker than usual and so he asked them why it was so. They told him about the man who had watered their flock for them. So he said to one of them ‘Summon him to come to me’."},{"SurahNumber":28,"VerseNumber":25,"Text":"God exalted be He says Then one of the two women came to him walking bashfully — in other words covering her face with the sleeve of her shirt being shy of him — and said ‘My father invites you that he may pay you a wage for watering our flock for us’. He accepted her invitation while inwardly he disapproved of accepting any wage for it was as though she sought to remunerate him and as though he were of those who would want it which he was not. She walked in front of him but when the wind began to blow off her dress and reveal her legs he said to her ‘Walk behind me and show me the way’ which she did. Finally he came to her father Shu‘ayb peace be upon him who was sitting with some supper in front of him. He said to him ‘Sit and have some supper’. He Moses said ‘I hope that this is not some sort of compensation for having watered their flock for them? For we are People of a House and do not demand compensation for good deeds’. He Shu‘ayb said ‘No. It is simply a custom of mine and of my forefathers to be hospitable to guests and to offer them food’. Thus he Moses ate and informed him of his predicament. God exalted be He says So when he came to him and recounted to him the story al-qasas is a verbal noun with the sense of al-maqsūs ‘that which is recounted’ of his slaying of the Egyptian and their intention to slay him and his fear of Pharaoh he their father said ‘Do not be afraid. You have escaped from the evildoing people’ as Pharaoh had no authority over Midian."},{"SurahNumber":28,"VerseNumber":26,"Text":"One of the two women the one that had been sent by her father either the elder or the younger said ‘O my father hire him employ him in return for a wage that he may tend our flock instead of us. Surely the best man you can hire is the strong the trustworthy man’ in other words hire him on account of his strength and trustworthiness. He Shu‘ayb asked her about him and she told him as mentioned above how he had lifted the rock off the well and that he had said to her ‘Walk behind me’ in addition to his lowering his head when he realised that she was coming towards him refusing to lift it until she left. He Shu‘ayb therefore was keen to have him marry one of his daughters."},{"SurahNumber":28,"VerseNumber":27,"Text":"He said ‘I desire to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine either the elder or the younger one on condition that you hire yourself to me that you are employed by me to tend my flock for eight years. And if you complete ten that is the tending of ten years that completion shall be of your own accord. I do not want to be hard on you by making it the marriage conditional on ten years service. God willing — expressed to seek God’s blessing — you shall find me to be one of the righteous’ of those who fulfil their covenants."},{"SurahNumber":28,"VerseNumber":28,"Text":"He Moses said ‘That which you have said is settled then between me and you.

And God is Guardian Keeper or Witness over what we you and I say’. The contract was agreed in this way. Shu‘ayb bid his daughter to give Moses a staff with which to beat off predatory beasts from his sheep — the staffs of the prophets were in his keeping. It was Adam’s staff made from the myrtle of Paradise that fell into her hands and so Moses took it with Shu‘ayb’s knowledge."},{"SurahNumber":28,"VerseNumber":29,"Text":"So when Moses had completed the term of his tending — of eight years or of ten years which is what is generally assumed — and was travelling with his family his wife with the permission of her father in the direction of Egypt he saw in the distance on the side of the Mount Tūr a fire al-Tūr is the name of a mountain.
