At that time a Badri Companion, Hatib ibn ‘Ali Balta‘a, secretly wrote to the Makkans about the plan in a letter and sent it covertly in the name of some Makkans, so that the Makkans would be grateful to him and in return they would refrain from inflicting harm upon his family members who were staying in Makkah. But this betrayal became known through Revelation and the messenger was caught on the way. Every such action is against the demand of Faith."},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"During the state of war, when the position is that Islam and non-Islam have become polarised on separate fronts, it is the responsibility of the people of Islam to sever their relations with the non-Islamic front, even if their relatives and dear ones are part of it. Being a believer in Truth and at the same time having close relations with the enemies with whom one is at war is totally wrong."},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"In the beginning, Abraham conveyed the message of the oneness of God to his family in the manner of a well-wisher. After he had carried out his mission and had come to the end of his arguments, when his hearers persisted in their rejection of the Truth, he completely separated himself from them. But this was a very difficult stage, because his stated intention to distance himself from them amounted to an invitation to the rejecters of Truth to harass the Faithful in every possible way, ultimately degrading them by the use of force to make up for their own defeat in the field of arguments. That is why Abraham subsequently offered up this special prayer, ‘O, Lord! Do not make us the target of the atrocities of the oppressors.’ To absolve oneself of the responsibility for the guidance of relatives does not entail enmity in the usual sense. It is simply the final expression of firm conviction. From this point of view this action becomes imbued with a missionary value. So, sometimes it happens that a person who is not affected by the language of a ‘message’, is successfully won over by the language of ‘faith’."},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"In the beginning, Abraham conveyed the message of the oneness of God to his family in the manner of a well-wisher.

Those who deny the truth do not expect any human being to be resurrected from his grave. The same is true of those People of the Book who, after embracing Faith have become forgetful of their religious duties and suffer from insensitivity. In spite of their verbal acceptance of the Hereafter, their practical life assumes the same pattern as that of those who deny the truth."}]}
