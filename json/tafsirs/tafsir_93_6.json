The word 'akhirah may be taken in its popular sense of the 'Hereafter' and its opposite ula may be taken in the sense of the present 'world'. With these words, Allah tells the Holy Prophet not to be disturbed by the taunts of the pagans, because they will see in this world that their assumptions and accusations were absolutely false. In the Hereafter, he will be blessed with Divine favours to his heart's content - much more than what he will receive in this fleeting world. The word 'akhirah may also be taken in its primitive sense i.e. 'the later state or condition' as opposed to ula 'the former state or condition'. The verse, in this case, would mean that every succeeding moment of the Holy Prophet's ﷺ life is better than the preceding one. It includes progress in knowledge and wisdom, as well as in degrees of his nearness to Allah, and it also includes progress in economic and political fields."},{"SurahNumber":93,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَ‌بُّكَ فَتَرْ‌ضَىٰ (And of course, your Lord will give you so much that you will be pleased....93:5). Allah does not specify here what he will give him. The statement is open and general. The Holy Prophet ﷺ will be granted everything he desires so much that he will be pleased. Among his desired thing is the progress of Islam; the general spread of Islam in the world; fulfillment of every need of the Ummah; triumph of the Holy Prophet himself over his enemies and raising the word of Allah in the land of the enemy. When this verse was revealed, the Holy Prophet ﷺ said:\nاِذا ! لّا اَرضٰی وَ وَاحدُ مِّن اُمَّتِی فِی النَّار\n'If that is the case, then I will not be pleased as long as one [ single member ] of my Ummah [ remains ] in Fire.' [ Qurtubi ].\nIn a narration by Sayyidna ` Ali ؓ ، the Holy Prophet ﷺ said: \"Allah will accept my intercession for my Ummah [ community ]. Allah will ask: رضیتَ یا محمد '0 Muhammad, are you pleased?' He will reply: یا رَبِّ رَضِیتُ \"My Lord, I am pleased.\" Muslim records from Sayyidna ` Amr Ibn-ul-` As to the effect that the Holy Prophet ﷺ recited a verse concerning the Prophet Ibrahim : (علیہ السلام)\nفَمَن تَبِعَنِي فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَإِنَّكَ غَفُورٌ‌ رَّ‌حِيمٌ\n'...So, one who followsme is surely mine, and the one who\ndisobeys me, then You are Most Forgiving, Very Merciful. [ 14:36] '\nThen he recited a verse which contains the words of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام)\nإِن تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ\n'If You punish them, then, they are Your slaves [ 5:118] '\nThen he raised his hands, he wept and prayed:\nاَللّٰھُمَّ اُمَّتِی اُمَّتِی\n'0 Allah, my ummah, my ummah!'\nAllah sent Jibra'il\tعلیہ السلام to inquire as to why he was weeping [ while Allah knows the reason ]. Jibra'il Amin\tعلیہ السلام came and inquired why he was weeping. The Holy Prophet ﷺ replied: \"I seek my ummah's forgiveness.\" Allah sent Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) back to inform him that He has pardoned them, and that Allah would please him and would not displease him regarding his ummah."},{"SurahNumber":93,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"In response to the unbelievers' taunts, it was briefly mentioned that the Holy Prophet ﷺ has already been blessed with many Divine favours. The Surah elaborates on three of them in particular.\nFavour [ 1]\nأَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيمًا فَآوَىٰ (Did He not find you an orphan, and give you shelter?...93:6). The Holy Prophet ﷺ was an orphan. His father died before he was born, leaving no wealth or property to look after him. The words 'and gave you shelter' signify that the Holy Prophet ﷺ received such deep love and affection from his grand-father, ` Abd-ul-Muttalib, and after him from his uncle, Abu Talib , who took care of him more than their own children."},{"SurahNumber":93,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"Favour [ 2]\nوَوَجَدَكَ ضَالًّا فَهَدَىٰ (And He found you unaware of the way [ the Shari` ah ], then He guided you....93:7). The word dall has two meanings: [ 1] stray; and [ 2] unaware. Here it stands for the second meaning. The verse signifies that before Muhammad k was commissioned as the Prophet ﷺ ، he was unaware of Divine Shari'ah. He was granted the status of the Prophet ﷺ and thus was guided."},{"SurahNumber":93,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"Favour [ 3]\nوَوَجَدَكَ عَائِلًا فَأَغْنَىٰ (and He found you in need, then made you need-free....93:8). The word ail is derived from ` ailah which means 'to be in need'. The verse signifies that Allah found him impoverished and enriched him. This happened in the beginning through a business partnership with Sayyidah Khadijah al-Kubra ؓ then once she became his wife and 'Mother of the Faithful', her entire wealth was devoted to his service.\nAfter elaborating on the three favours of Allah, three injunctions follow:"},{"SurahNumber":93,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"Injunction [ 1]\nفَأَمَّا الْيَتِيمَ فَلَا تَقْهَرْ‌ (Therefore, as for orphan, do not oppress him,...93:9). The word qahr means 'to treat people who are less powerful in an unfair and cruel way'. In the present context, the verse means: 'Since you were a poor orphan, and Allah sheltered you, do not oppress the orphan.' [ In words, 'do not seize their wealth by force and squander it. Do not scorn them, humiliate them or despise them. Rather, you should be kind and gentle to them.'] As a result, the Holy Prophet ﷺ emphasised that the orphan be treated kindly and gently, and has forbidden any hurting attitude towards them. The Holy Prophet ﷺ is reported to have said that the best house of a Muslim is the one in which there is an orphan who is treated kindly, and with love and affection. The worst house is the one in which there is an orphan who is treated badly. [ This is transmitted by Bukhari in Al-Adab-ul- Mufrad, and by Ibn Majah and Baghawi, as quoted by Mazhari ]."},{"SurahNumber":93,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"Injunction [ 2]\nوَأَمَّا السَّائِلَ فَلَا تَنْهَرْ‌ (and as for the beggar, do not scold him....93:10). The verb tanhar is derived from nahr which means 'to scold'. The word sa'il means 'one who asks'. It includes a person who asks people's wealth, that is, a beggar, and it also includes the one who asks a question of knowledge, that is, an academic investigator. The Holy Prophet ﷺ has forbidden to berate either of them. The best course of action is to give the beggar something. If one is unable to give a beggar anything, one should at least apologise to him politely [ so as not to give him any further grief ]. Likewise, anyone who is searching knowledge and asks questions, it is forbidden to respond to him harshly and unkindly. The teacher should reply kindly and politely. However, if the investigator is unreasonable in his approach, it is permissible to scold him to the degree that is necessary."},{"SurahNumber":93,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Injunction [ 3]\nوَأَمَّا بِنِعْمَةِ رَ‌بِّكَ فَحَدِّثْ (And about the bounty of your Lord, do talk....93:11). The verb haddith is derived from tahdith which means 'to talk' meaning, 'just as you were poor and needy, and Allah made you wealthy, then talk about Allah's favours upon you'. Talking about Divine favours to people is one way of thanking Allah. If a person has done something good to another, he should be thanked. Therefore, the Holy Prophet is reported to have said: \"Whoever is not thankful to people on their favours is not thankful to Allah.\" [ This is transmitted by Ahmad. The chain of authorities are reliable - vide Mazhari ].\nThe Holy Prophet ﷺ is reported to have said: \"Whoever has done good to you, you ought to return the good. If you are unable to return the pecuniary good, then praise him in public, because he who praises people in public fulfils his moral obligation.\" [ Al-Baghawi transmitted it from Jabir Ibn ` Abdullah, vide Mazhari ].\nRuling\nIt is obligatory to offer gratitude to Allah on every favour He has bestowed. (But the way of offering gratitude may be different.) If Allah has granted a person wealth, a part of that wealth may be spent with the sincerity in Allah's way. If Allah has given a person strong body, his bodily strength may be utilised in fulfilling Divine obligations. If Allah has granted a person Divine knowledge, he should impart it to others. [ Mazhari ].\nRuling\nIt is sunnah to recite takbir at the beginning of every Surah from Surah Duha to the end of the Qur'an. The wordings of the takbir, according to Shaikh Salih al-Misri, are as follows:\nلَٓا اَلٰہَ اِلَّا اللہُ وَ اللہُ اَکبَرُ\n'There is no god except Allah and Allah is the greatest' [ Mazhari ].\nAccording to Ibn Kathir, the takbir may be recited at the end of every Surah and, according to Baghawi, it may be recited once at the beginning of every Surah. [ Mazhari ]. Either way the requirement of sunnah will be fulfilled. And Allah knows best!\nNote\nIn most Surahs from Surah Duha to the end of Qur'an, Allah's special favours upon the Holy Prophet ﷺ and his special virtues and characteristics are mentioned. In a few of the Surahs, the Day of Judgment and its conditions are mentioned. The earlier part of the Qur'an asserts the greatness and authenticity of the Qur'an, while the later part asserts the greatness of the personality to whom the Qur'an was revealed.\nAl-hamdulillah\nThe Commentary on\nSurah Ad-Duha\nEnds here"}]}
