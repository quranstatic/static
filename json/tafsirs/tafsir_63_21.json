(And Allah knoweth) and Allah bears witness (that thou art) O Muhammad (indeed His messenger) without the need for the testimony of the hypocrites, (and Allah beareth witness) and Allah knows (that the Hypocrites are speaking falsely) that the hypocrites lie in their oath, because they do not know it nor are their hearts conscious of it."},{"SurahNumber":63,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"(They make their faith) they make their oath by Allah (a pretext) to escape being killed (that they may turn (men) from the way of Allah) and bar people from Allah's religion and obedience in secret.
