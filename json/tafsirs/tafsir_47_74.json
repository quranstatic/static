Thus in the same manner of clarification does God strike for mankind similitudes of themselves that is how He clarifies for them their states in other words the disbeliever has his work rendered void while the believer is forgiven."},{"SurahNumber":47,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"So when you encounter in battle those who disbelieve then attack them with a striking of the necks fa-darba’l-riqābi is a verbal noun in place of the full verbal construction that is to say fa’dribū riqābahum ‘then strike their necks’ in other words slay them — reference is made to the ‘striking of the necks’ because the predominant cause of being slayed is to be struck in the neck. Then when you have made thoroughly decimated them bind spare them take them captive and bind firmly the bonds al-wathāq is what is used to bind yūthaqu a captive. Thereafter either set them free by grace mannan is a verbal noun in place of the full verbal construction that is to say either show them grace by setting them free unconditionally; or by ransom ransoming them with payment or with Muslim captives until the war that is to say its participants lay down its burdens its heavy loads of weaponry and other things so that either the disbelievers surrender or enter into a treaty. This last clause constitutes the ‘purpose’ of enjoining the Muslims to slaying and taking captive. So shall it be dhālika is the predicate of an implied subject such as al-amr ‘the ordinance’ in other words ‘the ordinance of God regarding them is as mentioned’. And had God willed He could have Himself taken vengeance on them without any fighting but He has commanded you to do it that He may test some of you by means of others from among them by way of battle so that the slain among you will end up in Paradise while those slain among them will end up in the Fire. And those who are slain qutilū a variant reading has qātalū ‘those who fight’ — this verse was revealed on the day of the battle of Uhud after the dead and the wounded had become numerous among the Muslims — in the way of God He will not let their works go to waste He will not render them void."},{"SurahNumber":47,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"He will guide them in this world and in the Hereafter to what benefits them and rightly dispose their minds their condition in both with that guidance and disposal in this world being for those who were not slain but who have been included in the statement ‘and those who were slain’ qutilū because of the predominance therein of those who were slain."},{"SurahNumber":47,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"And He will admit them into Paradise which He has made known which He has pointed out to them so that they are guided to their dwellings in it and to their spouses and servants without asking to be shown the way."},{"SurahNumber":47,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"O you who believe! If you help God that is to say His religion and His Messenger He will help you against your enemy and make your foothold firm He will make you stand firm while you fight on the battleground."},{"SurahNumber":47,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"And as for those who disbelieve from among the people of Mecca wa’lladhīna kafarū is the subject the predicate of which is an implicit ta‘isū ‘they shall be wretched’ as indicated by what follows wretchedness shall be their lot that is destruction and defeat from God. And He will make their works go to waste wa-adalla a‘mālahum is a supplement to the implied ta‘isū ‘they shall be wretched’."},{"SurahNumber":47,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"That wretchedness and wasting of their works is because they are averse to what God has revealed of the Qur’ān with all that it includes of religious obligations takālīf so He has made their works fail."},{"SurahNumber":47,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? God destroyed them — He destroyed them their children and their possessions; and a fate the like thereof will be for the disbelievers that is to say the like of the fate of those before them."},{"SurahNumber":47,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"That granting of victory to the believers and the vanquishing of the disbelievers is because God is Patron Ally and Helper of those who believe and because the disbelievers have no patron."},{"SurahNumber":47,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"God will surely admit those who believe and perform righteous deeds into gardens underneath which rivers flow. As for those who disbelieve they take their enjoyment in this world and eat as the cattle eat that is to say they are only concerned with filling their bellies and satisfying their private parts without giving any thought to the Hereafter; and the Fire will be their habitation their home their station and their final destination."},{"SurahNumber":47,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"And how many ka-ayyin means kam a town by which is meant the inhabitants thereof mightier in power than your town Mecca that is to say its inhabitants which expelled you akhrajatka is feminine despite the plural sense of inhabitants meant is because it takes into account the feminine form of qarya ‘town’ have We destroyed ahlaknāhum takes into account the former plural import of qarya ‘town’ and they had none to help them against Our destruction of them."},{"SurahNumber":47,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"Is he who follows a clear sign a definitive argument and proof from his Lord and these are the believers like those whose evil deeds have been adorned for them so that they see them as fair deeds and these are the disbelievers of Mecca and who follow their desires? by worshipping graven images.

Is such a one like him who abides in the Fire? ka-man huwa khālidun fī’l-nāri the predicate of an implied subject which is a-man huwa fī hādha’l-na‘īm ‘Is one who is amidst such bliss as him who abides in the Fire?’.

For already its portents the signs thereof have come among which are the sending of the Prophet s the splitting of the Moon Q. 541 and the Smoke Q. 4410.

Indeed he did do this. The Prophet s said ‘Verily I do ask God for forgiveness a hundred times every day’ — and for the believing men and believing women — herein is an honouring for them by having their Prophet enjoined to ask forgiveness for them. And God knows your going to and fro your bustle during the day in pursuit of your business and your place of rest when you retire to where you sleep at night. In other words He has knowledge of all your states nothing of which can be hidden from Him so be mindful of Him — the address in this verse is meant for believers as well as others."},{"SurahNumber":47,"VerseNumber":20,"Text":"And those who believe say seeking to take part in the struggle ‘Why has a sūra not been revealed?’ one in which there is mention of the command to participate in the struggle.
