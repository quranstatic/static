Then Allah says:\nإِنَّ فِرْعَوْنَ عَلاَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(Verily, Fir`awn exalted himself in the land) means, he was an arrogant oppressor and tyrant.\nوَجَعَلَ أَهْلَهَا شِيَعاً\n(and made its people Shiya`) means, he made them into different classes, each of which he used to do whatever he wanted of the affairs of his state.\nيَسْتَضْعِفُ طَآئِفَةً مِّنْهُمْ\n(weakening a group among them. ) This refers to the Children of Israel, who at that time were the best of people, even though this tyrant king overpowered them, using them to do the most menial work and forcing them to hard labor night and day for him and his people. At the same time, he was killing their sons and letting their daughters live, to humiliate them and because he feared that there might appear among them the boy who would be the cause of his destruction and the downfall of his kingdom. So Fir`awn took precautions against that happening, by ordering that all boys born to the Children of Israel should be killed, but this precaution did not protect him against the divine decree, because when the term of Allah comes, it cannot be delayed, and for each and every matter there is a decree from Allah. Allah says:\nوَنُرِيدُ أَن نَّمُنَّ عَلَى الَّذِينَ اسْتُضْعِفُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(And We wished to do a favor to those who were weak in the land,) until His saying;\nيَحْذَرُونَ\n(which they feared.)

Fir`awn hoped that by his strength and power he would be saved from Musa, but that did not help him in the slightest. Despite his great power as a king he could not oppose the decree of Allah, which can never be overcome.

So they said to Fir`awn, \"If this continues, and their old men die and the young men are killed, their women will not be able to do the work that the men are doing, and we will end up having to do it.\" So Fir`awn issued orders that the boys should be killed one year, and left alone the following year. Harun, peace be upon him, was born in a year when the boys were not killed, and Musa was born in a year when the boys were being killed. Fir`awn had people who were entrusted with this task. There were midwives who would go around and check on the women, and if they noticed that any woman was pregnant, they would write her name down. When the time came for her to give birth, no one was allowed to attend her except for Coptic women. If the woman gave birth to a girl, they would leave her alone and go away, but if she gave birth to a boy, the killers would come in with their sharp knives and kill the child, then they would go away; may Allah curse them. When the mother of Musa became pregnant with him, she did not show any signs of pregnancy as other women did, and none of the midwives noticed. But when she gave birth to a boy, she became very distressed and did not know what to do with him. She was extremely scared for him, because she loved him very much. No one ever saw Musa, peace be upon him, but they loved him, and the blessed ones were those who loved him both as a natural feeling and because he was a Prophet. Allah says:\nوَأَلْقَيْتُ عَلَيْكَ مَحَبَّةً مِّنِّى\n(And I endued you with love from Me) (20:39).\nMusa, peace be upon him, in the House of Fir`awn\nWhen Musa's mother became so worried and confused, it was inspired into her heart and mind what she should do, as Allah says:\nوَأَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَى أُمِّ مُوسَى أَنْ أَرْضِعِيهِ فَإِذَا خِفْتِ عَلَيْهِ فَأَلْقِيهِ فِى اليَمِّ وَلاَ تَخَافِى وَلاَ تَحْزَنِى إِنَّا رَآدُّوهُ إِلَيْكِ وَجَـعِلُوهُ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(And We inspired the mother of Musa (telling): \"Suckle him, but when you fear for him, then cast him into the river and fear not, nor grieve. Verily, We shall bring him back to you, and shall make him one of (Our) Messengers.\") Her house was on the banks of the Nile, so she took a box and made it into a cradle, and started to nurse her child. When someone came to her that she was afraid of, she would go and put him in that box and put it in the river, and she would tie it with a rope. One day someone that she was afraid of came to the house, so she went and put the child in that box and put it in the river, but she forgot to tie it. The water carried him away, past the house of Fir`awn, where some servant women picked the box up and took it to Fir`awn's wife. They did not know what was inside, and they were afraid that they would be in trouble if they opened it without her. When the box was opened, they saw it was a child with the most beautiful features. Allah filled her heart with love for him when she saw him; this was because she was blessed and because Allah wanted to honor her and cause her husband's doom. Allah says:\nفَالْتَقَطَهُ ءَالُ فِرْعَوْنَ لِيَكُونَ لَهُمْ عَدُوّاً وَحَزَناً\n(Then the household of Fir`awn picked him up, that he might become for them an enemy and a (cause of) grief.) Allah says:\nإِنَّ فِرْعَوْنَ وَهَـمَـنَ وَجُنُودَهُمَا كَانُواْ خَـطِئِينَ\n(Verily, Fir`awn, Haman and their armies were sinners.)\nوَقَالَتِ امْرَأَتُ فِرْعَوْنَ قُرَّةُ عَيْنٍ لِّى وَلَكَ\n(And the wife of Fir`awn said: \"A comfort of the eye for me and for you...\") means, when Fir`awn saw him, he wanted to kill him, fearing that he was one of the Children of Israel. But his wife Asiyah bint Muzahim came to the child's defence and tried to endear him to Fir`awn, saying,\nقُرَّةُ عَيْنٍ لِّى وَلَكَ\n(A comfort of the eye for me and for you.) Fir`awn said: \"For you he may be, but not for me.

So they said to Fir`awn, \"If this continues, and their old men die and the young men are killed, their women will not be able to do the work that the men are doing, and we will end up having to do it.\" So Fir`awn issued orders that the boys should be killed one year, and left alone the following year. Harun, peace be upon him, was born in a year when the boys were not killed, and Musa was born in a year when the boys were being killed. Fir`awn had people who were entrusted with this task. There were midwives who would go around and check on the women, and if they noticed that any woman was pregnant, they would write her name down. When the time came for her to give birth, no one was allowed to attend her except for Coptic women. If the woman gave birth to a girl, they would leave her alone and go away, but if she gave birth to a boy, the killers would come in with their sharp knives and kill the child, then they would go away; may Allah curse them. When the mother of Musa became pregnant with him, she did not show any signs of pregnancy as other women did, and none of the midwives noticed. But when she gave birth to a boy, she became very distressed and did not know what to do with him. She was extremely scared for him, because she loved him very much. No one ever saw Musa, peace be upon him, but they loved him, and the blessed ones were those who loved him both as a natural feeling and because he was a Prophet.

Verily, We shall bring him back to you, and shall make him one of (Our) Messengers.\") Her house was on the banks of the Nile, so she took a box and made it into a cradle, and started to nurse her child. When someone came to her that she was afraid of, she would go and put him in that box and put it in the river, and she would tie it with a rope. One day someone that she was afraid of came to the house, so she went and put the child in that box and put it in the river, but she forgot to tie it. The water carried him away, past the house of Fir`awn, where some servant women picked the box up and took it to Fir`awn's wife. They did not know what was inside, and they were afraid that they would be in trouble if they opened it without her. When the box was opened, they saw it was a child with the most beautiful features. Allah filled her heart with love for him when she saw him; this was because she was blessed and because Allah wanted to honor her and cause her husband's doom.

This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu `Ubaydah, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Qatadah and others.\nإِن كَادَتْ لَتُبْدِى بِهِ\n(She was very near to disclose his (case),) means, because of the intensity of her grief, she almost told people that she had lost a son. She would have disclosed her situation, if Allah had not given her strength and patience. Allah says:\nلَوْلا أَن رَّبَطْنَا عَلَى قَلْبِهَا لِتَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَوَقَالَتْ لأُخْتِهِ قُصِّيهِ\n(had We not strengthened her heart, so that she might remain as one of the believers. And she said to his sister: \"Follow him.\") means, she told her daughter, who was older and was of an age to understand things,\nقُصِّيهِ\n(Follow him.) means, follow his traces and look for information about him, try to find out about him around the city. So she went out to do that.\nفَبَصُرَتْ بِهِ عَن جُنُبٍ\n(So she watched him from a far place (secretly),) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Off to the side.\" Mujahid said, \"It means she looked from afar. Qatadah said: \"She started to look at him as if she was not really interested.\" When Musa had settled into the house of Fir`awn, after the king's wife had begun to love him and asked Fir`awn not to kill him, they brought to him the wet nurses who were to be found in their household, and he did not accept any of them, refusing to take milk from them. So they took him out to the marketplace, hoping to find a woman who would be suitable to nurse him. When (his sister) saw him in their arms, she recognized him, but she did not give any indication nor did they suspect her. Allah says:\nوَحَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِ الْمَرَاضِعَ مِن قَبْلُ\n(And We had already forbidden foster suckling mothers for him,) Because of his honored status with Allah, it was forbidden by divine decree. It was decreed that no one should nurse him except his own mother, and Allah caused this to be the means reuniting him with his mother so that she could nurse him and feel safe after having felt such fear. When his sister saw that they were confused over who should nurse the child,\nفَقَالَتْ هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى أَهْلِ بَيْتٍ يَكْفُلُونَهُ لَكُمْ وَهُمْ لَهُ نَـصِحُونَ\n(she said: \"Shall I direct you to a household who will rear him for you, and look after him in a good manner\") Ibn `Abbas said: When she said that, they had some doubts about her, so they seized her and asked her, How do you know these people will be sincere and will care for him\" She said to them, \"They will be sincere and will care for him because they want the king to be happy and because they hope for some reward.\" So they let her go. After what she said, being safe from their harm, they took her to their house and brought the baby to his mother. She gave him her breast and he accepted it, so they rejoiced and sent the glad tidings to the wife of Fir`awn. She called for Musa's mother, treating her kindly and rewarding her generously. She did not realize that she was his real mother, but she saw that the baby accepted her breast. Then Asiyah asked her to stay with her and nurse the baby, but she refused, saying, \"I have a husband and children, and I cannot stay with you, but if you would like me to nurse him in my own home, I will do that.\" The wife of Fir`awn agreed to that, and paid her a regular salary and gave her extra gifts and clothing and treated her kindly. The mother of Musa came back with her child, happy that after a time of fear Allah granted her security, prestige, and ongoing provision. There was only a short time between the distress and the way out, a day and night, or thereabouts -- and Allah knows best. Glory be to the One in Whose hands are all things; what He wills happens and what He does not will does not happen. He is the One Who grants those who fear Him, a way out from every worry and distress, Allah said:\nفَرَدَدْنَـهُ إِلَى أُمِّهِ كَىْ تَقَرَّ عَيْنُهَا\n(So We restored him to his mother, that her eye might be comforted,) means, by him,\nوَلاَ تَحْزَنْ\n(and that she might not grieve, ) means, for him.\nوَلِتَعْلَمَ أَنَّ وَعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ\n(and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true.) meaning, `We had promised her to return him to her and to make him one of the Messengers.' When he was returned to her, she realized that he was one of the Messengers, so as she brought him up, she treated him both as a child (with kindness) and as a Messenger (with respect).\nوَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(But most of them know not.) means, they do not know the wisdom of Allah in His actions and their good consequences, for which He is to be praised in this world and the Hereafter. For a thing may happen that people do not like, but its consequences are good, as Allah says:\nوَعَسَى أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَعَسَى أَن تُحِبُّواْ شَيْئًا وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَّكُمْ\n(and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you) (2:216).\nفَعَسَى أَن تَكْرَهُواْ شَيْئاً وَيَجْعَلَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ خَيْراً كَثِيراً\n(it may be that you dislike a thing and Allah brings through it a great deal of good) (4:19)."},{"SurahNumber":28,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"How Musa killed a Coptic Man\nHaving described Musa's beginnings, Allah then tells us that when he reached maturity, and was complete in stature, Allah gave him Hukm and religious knowledge.

Then his Lord called him:\nمِن شَاطِىءِ الْوَادِى الأَيْمَنِ فِى الْبُقْعَةِ الْمُبَارَكَةِ مِنَ الشَّجَرَةِ\n(from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place, from the tree.)\nأَن يمُوسَى إِنِّى أَنَا اللَّهُ رَبُّ الْعَـلَمِينَ\n(O Musa! Verily, I am Allah, the Lord of all that exits!) meaning, `the One Who is addressing you and speaking to you is the Lord of all that exits, the One Who does what He wills, the One apart from Whom there is no other god or lord, may He be exalted and sanctified, the One Who by His very nature, attributes, words and deeds is far above any resemblance to His creation, may He be glorified.\nوَأَنْ أَلْقِ عَصَاكَ\n(And throw your stick!) `the stick that is in your hand' -- as was stated in the Ayah,\nوَمَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ يمُوسَى - قَالَ هِىَ عَصَاىَ أَتَوَكَّؤُا عَلَيْهَا وَأَهُشُّ بِهَا عَلَى غَنَمِى وَلِىَ فِيهَا مَأَرِبُ أُخْرَى\n(\"And what is that in your right hand, O Musa\" He said: \"This is my stick, whereon I lean, and wherewith I beat down branches for my sheep, and wherein I find other uses.\") (20:17-18).

It was a snake, moving quickly.) (20:19-20). Musa knew that the One Who was speaking to him was the One Who merely says to a thing, \"Be!\" and it is, as we have already stated in (the explanation of) Surah Ta Ha. And here Allah says:\nفَلَمَّا رَءَاهَا تَهْتَزُّ كَأَنَّهَا جَآنٌّ وَلَّى مُدْبِراً\n(But when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned in flight,) It moved so quickly, even though it was so big, and its mouth was so huge, with its jaws snapping. It swallowed every rock it passed, and every rock that fell into its mouth fell with a sound like a rock falling into a valley. When he saw that:\nوَلَّى مُدْبِراً وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ\n(he turned in flight, and looked not back.) he did not turn around, because it is human nature to flee from such a thing. But when Allah said to him:\nيمُوسَى أَقْبِلْ وَلاَ تَخَفْ إِنَّكَ مِنَ الاٌّمِنِينَ\n(O Musa! Draw near, and fear not. Verily, you are of those who are secure.) he came back to his original position. Then Allah said:\nاسْلُكْ يَدَكَ فِى جَيْبِكَ تَخْرُجْ بَيْضَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ\n(Put your hand into the opening of your garment, it will come forth white without a disease;) meaning, `when you put your hand in your garment and then draw it out, it will be shining white as if it were a piece of the moon or a flash of lightning.' Allah said:\nمِنْ غَيْرِ سُوءٍ\n(without a disease) i.e., with no trace of leukoderma.\nوَاضْمُمْ إِلَيْكَ جَنَاحَكَ مِنَ الرَّهْبِ\n(and draw your hand close to your side to be free from the fear.) Mujahid said, \"To be free from terror.\" Qatadah said, \"To be free from fear.\" Musa was commanded, when he felt afraid of anything, to draw his hand close to his side to be free from the fear. If he did that, whatever fear he felt would be gone. Perhaps if a person does this, following the example of Musa, and puts his hand over his heart, his fear will disappear or be lessened, if Allah wills; in Allah we place our trust.\nفَذَانِكَ بُرْهَانَـنِ مِن رَّبِّكَ\n(These are two proofs from your Lord) This refers to the throwing down of his stick, whereupon it turned into a moving snake, and his putting his hand into his garment and bringing it forth white without a disease. These were two clear and definitive proofs of the power of the One Who does as He chooses, and of the truth of the prophethood of the one at whose hands these miracles occurred. Allah said:\nإِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ وَمَلإِيْهِ\n(to Fir`awn and his chiefs.) meaning his leaders and prominent followers.\nإِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ\n(Verily, they are the people who are rebellious.) means, who are disobedient towards Allah and who go against His commands and His religion."},{"SurahNumber":28,"VerseNumber":30,"Text":"Musa's Return to Egypt and how he was honored with the Mission and Miracles on the Way\nIn the explanation of the previous Ayah, we have already seen that Musa completed the longer and better of the two terms, which may also be understood from the Ayah where Allah says:\nفَلَمَّا قَضَى مُوسَى الاٌّجَلَ\n(Then, when Musa had fulfilled the term,) meaning, the longer of the two; and Allah knows best.\nوَسَارَ بِأَهْلِهِ\n(and was traveling with his family,) They said: \"Musa missed his country and his relatives, so he resolved to visit them in secret, without Fir`awn and his people knowing.

I have killed a man among them,) meaning, that Coptic,\nفَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ\n(and I fear that they will kill me.) i.e., `when they see me.'\nوَأَخِى هَـرُونُ هُوَ أَفْصَحُ مِنِّى لِسَاناً\n(And my brother Harun -- he is more eloquent in speech than me,) Musa, peace be upon him, had a speech defect, because when he had been given the choice between a date and a pearl, he mistakenly picked up a coal and placed it on his tongue, so he found it difficult to speak clearly. Musa said:\nوَاحْلُلْ عُقْدَةً مِّن لِّسَانِى - يَفْقَهُواْ قَوْلِي - وَاجْعَل لِّى وَزِيراً مِّنْ أَهْلِى - هَـرُونَ أَخِى - اشْدُدْ بِهِ أَزْرِى - وَأَشْرِكْهُ فِى أَمْرِى\n(\"And loose the knot (the defect) from my tongue. That they understand my speech. And appoint for me a helper from my family, Harun, my brother. Increase my strength with him, And let him share my task.\") (20:27-32) meaning, `give me someone to keep me company in this immense task of prophethood and conveying the Message to this arrogant, tyrannical and stubborn king. ' Hence Musa said:\nوَأَخِى هَـرُونُ هُوَ أَفْصَحُ مِنِّى لِسَاناً فَأَرْسِلْهِ مَعِىَ رِدْءاً\n(And my brother Harun -- he is more eloquent in speech than me: so send him with me as a helper) meaning, as a support to give strength to my cause and confirm what I say and convey from Allah, because the word of two carries more weight in people's minds than the word of one. So he said:\nإِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ\n(Verily, I fear that they will deny me.) Muhammad bin Ishaq said: c\nرِدْءاً يُصَدِّقُنِى\n(as a helper to confirm me.) means, `to explain to them what I say, for he can understand me where they may not.' When Musa asked for this, Allah said to him:\nسَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ\n(We will strengthen your arm through your brother,) meaning, `We will add strength to your cause and give you help through your brother, who you have asked to be made a Prophet alongside you.' This is like the Ayat;\nقَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى\n(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)\nوَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ مِن رَّحْمَتِنَآ أَخَاهُ هَـرُونَ نَبِيّاً\n(And We granted him his brother Harun, (also) a Prophet, out of Our mercy) (19:53). One of the Salaf said, \"There is no one who has ever done a greater favor to his brother than Musa did for Harun, may peace be upon them both, for he interceded for him until Allah made him a Prophet and Messenger with him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. Allah said concerning Musa:\nوَكَانَ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَجِيهاً\n(he was honorable before Allah) (33:69).\nوَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً\n(and (We will) give you both power) means, overwhelming evidence.\nفَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ\n(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our Ayat;) means, `they will have no way or means of harming you because you are conveying the signs of Allah.' This is like the Ayat:\nيَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ\n(O Messenger! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord.) until His saying:\nوَاللَّهُ يَعْصِمُكَ مِنَ النَّاسِ\n(Allah will protect you from mankind) (5:67).\nالَّذِينَ يُبَلِّغُونَ رِسَالـتِ اللَّهِ\n(Those who convey the Message of Allah) until His saying:\nوَكَفَى بِاللَّهِ حَسِيباً\n(And sufficient is Allah as a Reckoner) (33:39). And sufficient is Allah as a Helper and Supporter. And Allah told them the consequences in this world and the next, for them and for those who followed them,\nأَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ\n(you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors.) This is like the Ayat:\nكَتَبَ اللَّهُ لاّغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِى إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ\n(Allah has decreed: \"Verily, it is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious.\" Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.) (58:21)\nإِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا\n(Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe in this world's life) (40:51) to the end of the Ayah."},{"SurahNumber":28,"VerseNumber":36,"Text":"Musa before Fir`awn and His People\nAllah tells us how Musa and his brother Harun came before Fir`awn and his chiefs, and showed them the clear miracles and overwhelming proof that Allah had given them to confirm the truth of what they were saying about Allah being One and that His commandments were to be followed.

This is like what Allah says about the situation after He revealed His blessed Book the Qur'an:\nأَن تَقُولُواْ إِنَّمَآ أُنزِلَ الْكِتَـبُ عَلَى طَآئِفَتَيْنِ مِن قَبْلِنَا وَإِن كُنَّا عَن دِرَاسَتِهِمْ لَغَـفِلِينَ أَوْ تَقُولُواْ لَوْ أَنَّآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا الْكِتَـبُ لَكُنَّآ أَهْدَى مِنْهُمْ فَقَدْ جَآءَكُمْ بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةٌ\n(Lest you should say: \"The Book was sent down only to two sects before us, and for our part, we were in fact unaware of what they studied.\" Or lest you should say: \"If only the Book had been sent down to us, we would surely have been better guided than they.\" So, now has come unto you a clear proof from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy) (6:156-157).\nرُّسُلاً مُّبَشِّرِينَ وَمُنذِرِينَ لِئَلاَّ يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَى اللَّهِ حُجَّةٌ بَعْدَ الرُّسُلِ\n(Messengers as bearers of good news as well as warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the Messengers) (4:165).\nيَـأَهْلَ الْكِتَـبِ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولُنَا يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمْ عَلَى فَتْرَةٍ مَّنَ الرُّسُلِ أَن تَقُولُواْ مَا جَآءَنَا مِن بَشِيرٍ وَلاَ نَذِيرٍ فَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ بَشِيرٌ وَنَذِيرٌ\n(O People of the Scripture! Now has come to you Our Messenger making (things) clear unto you, after a break in (the series of) Messengers, lest you say: \"There came unto us no bringer of glad tidings and no warner.\" But now has come unto you a bringer of glad tidings and a warner) (5:19). And there are many similar Ayat."},{"SurahNumber":28,"VerseNumber":48,"Text":"The stubborn Response of the Disbelievers\nAllah tells us that if people were to be punished before proof was established against them, they would use the excuse that no Messenger came to them, but when the truth did come to them through Muhammad ﷺ, in their stubbornness, disbelief, ignorance and misguided thinking, they said:\nلَوْلا أُوتِىَ مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ مُوسَى\n(Why is he not given the like of what was given to Musa) Meaning -- and Allah knows best -- many signs like the staff, the hand, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, the blood, the destruction of crops and fruits -- which made things difficult for the enemies of Allah -- and the parting of the sea, the clouds (following the Children of Israel in the wilderness and) shading them, the manna and quails, and other clear signs and definitive proof, miracles which Allah wrought at the hands of Musa as evidence and proof against Fir`awn and his chiefs and the Children of Israel. But all of this had no effect on Fir`awn and his chiefs; on the contrary, they denied Musa and his brother Harun, as Allah tells us:\nأَجِئْتَنَا لِتَلْفِتَنَا عَمَّا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ ءابَاءَنَا وَتَكُونَ لَكُمَا الْكِبْرِيَآءُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكُمَا بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(Have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our fathers following, and that you two may have greatness in the land We are not going to believe you two!)

Allah says:\nقُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَـبٍ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ هُوَ أَهْدَى مِنْهُمَآ أَتَّبِعْهُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ\n(Then bring a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than these two, that I may follow it, if you are truthful.) meaning, `in your efforts to refute the truth with false arguments.'\nفَإِن لَّمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَكَ\n(But if they answer you not,) means, `if they do not respond to what you tell them, and do not follow the truth,'\nفَاعْلَمْ أَنَّمَا يَتَّبِعُونَ أَهْوَآءَهُمْ\n(then know that they only follow their own lusts.) means, with no basis or evidence. p\nوَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّنْ اتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ بِغَيْرِ هُدًى مِّنَ اللَّهِ\n(And who is more astray than one who follows his own lusts, without guidance from Allah) means, with no guidance taken from the Book of Allah.\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَهْدِى الْقَوْمَ الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(Verily, Allah guides not the people who are wrongdoers.)\nوَلَقَدْ وَصَّلْنَا لَهُمُ الْقَوْلَ\n(And indeed now We have conveyed the Word) Mujahid said: \"We have explained the Word to them.\" As-Suddi said something similar.

Mujahid and others said:\nوَصَّلْنَا لَهُمُ\n(We have conveyed the Word) means, to Quraysh."},{"SurahNumber":28,"VerseNumber":51,"Text":"The stubborn Response of the Disbelievers\nAllah tells us that if people were to be punished before proof was established against them, they would use the excuse that no Messenger came to them, but when the truth did come to them through Muhammad ﷺ, in their stubbornness, disbelief, ignorance and misguided thinking, they said:\nلَوْلا أُوتِىَ مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ مُوسَى\n(Why is he not given the like of what was given to Musa) Meaning -- and Allah knows best -- many signs like the staff, the hand, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, the blood, the destruction of crops and fruits -- which made things difficult for the enemies of Allah -- and the parting of the sea, the clouds (following the Children of Israel in the wilderness and) shading them, the manna and quails, and other clear signs and definitive proof, miracles which Allah wrought at the hands of Musa as evidence and proof against Fir`awn and his chiefs and the Children of Israel. But all of this had no effect on Fir`awn and his chiefs; on the contrary, they denied Musa and his brother Harun, as Allah tells us:\nأَجِئْتَنَا لِتَلْفِتَنَا عَمَّا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهِ ءابَاءَنَا وَتَكُونَ لَكُمَا الْكِبْرِيَآءُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَمَا نَحْنُ لَكُمَا بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(Have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our fathers following, and that you two may have greatness in the land We are not going to believe you two!) (10:78)\nفَكَذَّبُوهُمَا فَكَانُواْ مِنَ الْمُهْلَكِينَ\n(So they denied them both and became of those who were destroyed.) (23:48)\nThe Rebellious do not believe in Miracles\nAllah says here:\nأَوَلَمْ يَكْفُرُواْ بِمَآ أُوتِىَ مُوسَى مِن قَبْلُ\n(Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Musa of old) Did not mankind disbelieve in those mighty signs which were given to Musa\nقَالُواْ سِحْرَانِ تَظَـهَرَا\n(They say: \"Two kinds of magic, each helping the other!\") cooperating or working one with the other.\nوَقَالُواْ إِنَّا بِكُلٍّ كَـفِرُونَ\n(And they say: \"Verily, in both we are disbelievers.\") meaning, `we disbelieve in each of them.' Because of the close relationship between Musa and Harun, mention of one includes the other.\nFalse Accusation that Musa and Harun (peace be upon them both) practiced Magic\nMujahid bin Jabr said, \"The Jews told Quraysh to say this to Muhammad , then Allah said: `Did they not disbelieve in that which was given to Musa of old They say: Two kinds of magic, each helping the other!' This refers to Musa and Harun, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon them both,\nتَظَـهَرَا\n(each helping the other) i.e., working together and supporting one another.\" This was also the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr and Abu Razin that the phrase \"two kinds of magic\" referred to Musa and Harun. This is a good suggestion. And Allah knows best.\nThe Response to this False Accusation\nسِحْرَانِ تَظَـهَرَا\n(Two kinds of magic, each helping the other!) `Ali bin Abi Talhah and Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said that this refers to the Tawrah and the Qur'an, because Allah says next:\nقُلْ فَأْتُواْ بِكِتَـبٍ مِّنْ عِندِ اللَّهِ هُوَ أَهْدَى مِنْهُمَآ أَتَّبِعْهُ\n(Say: \"Then bring a Book from Allah, which is a better guide than these two that I may follow it.\") Allah often mentions the Tawrah and the Qur'an together, as in the Ayat:\nقُلْ مَنْ أَنزَلَ الْكِتَـبَ الَّذِى جَآءَ بِهِ مُوسَى نُوراً وَهُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ\n(Say: \"Who then sent down the Book which Musa brought, a light and a guidance to mankind...) until:\nوَهَـذَا كِتَـبٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ مُبَارَكٌ\n(And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down.\") (6:91-92) And at the end of the same Surah, Allah says:\nثُمَّ ءاتَيْنَا مُوسَى الْكِتَـبَ تَمَامًا عَلَى الَّذِى أَحْسَنَ\n(Then, We gave Musa the Book, to complete (Our favor) upon those who would do right) (6: 154).\nوَهَـذَا كِتَـبٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ مُبَارَكٌ فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَاتَّقُواْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُرْحَمُونَ\n(And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it and have Taqwa of Allah, that you may receive mercy) (6:155). And the Jinn said:\nإِنَّا سَمِعْنَا كِتَـباً أُنزِلَ مِن بَعْدِ مُوسَى مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ\n(Verily, we have heard a Book sent down after Musa, confirming what came before it) (46:30). Waraqah bin Nawfal said, \"This is An-Namus, who came down to Musa.\" And those who are possessed of insight know instinctively that among the many Books which He has sent down to His Prophets, there is no Book more perfect, more eloquent or more noble than the Book which He revealed to Muhammad ﷺ, which is the Qur'an. Next to it in status and greatness is the Book which Allah revealed to Musa bin `Imran, which is the Book concerning which Allah says:\nإِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَا التَّوْرَاةَ فِيهَا هُدًى وَنُورٌ يَحْكُمُ بِهَا النَّبِيُّونَ الَّذِينَ أَسْلَمُواْ لِلَّذِينَ هَادُواْ وَالرَّبَّانِيُّونَ وَالاٌّحْبَارُ بِمَا اسْتُحْفِظُواْ مِن كِتَـبِ اللَّهِ وَكَانُواْ عَلَيْهِ شُهَدَآءَ\n(Verily, We did send down the Tawrah, therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah's will, judged for the Jews. And the rabbis and the priests, for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah's Book, and they were witnesses thereto) (5:44). The Injil was revealed as a continuation and complement of the Tawrah and to permit some of the things that had been forbidden to the Children of Israel.

They were arrogant transgressors who denied Allah's blessing of giving them ample provision. This is like the Ayah, o\nوَضَرَبَ اللَّهُ مَثَلاً قَرْيَةً كَانَتْ ءَامِنَةً مُّطْمَئِنَّةً يَأْتِيهَا رِزْقُهَا رَغَدًا مِّن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ\n(And Allah puts forward the example of a township, that dwelt secure and well-content: its provision coming to it in abundance from every place) until:\nفَأَخَذَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ وَهُمْ ظَـلِمُونَ\n(So the torment overtook them while they were wrongdoers.)

Allah tells us that He will destroy every town before the Day of Resurrection, as He says:\nوَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولاً\n(And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger.) (17:15). Allah has sent the Unlettered Prophet to all the towns (all of mankind), because he has been sent to the Mother of Cities, their source to which they all return.

Prophethood ended with him, and there is no Prophet or Messenger to come after him, but his way will remain as long as night and day remain, until the Day of Resurrection."},{"SurahNumber":28,"VerseNumber":59,"Text":"The Destruction of Towns, which are not destroyed until Evidence is established against Them\nReferring to the people of Makkah, Allah says:\nوَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ بَطِرَتْ مَعِيشَتَهَا\n(And how many a town have We destroyed, which was thankless for its means of livelihood!) They were arrogant transgressors who denied Allah's blessing of giving them ample provision. This is like the Ayah, o\nوَضَرَبَ اللَّهُ مَثَلاً قَرْيَةً كَانَتْ ءَامِنَةً مُّطْمَئِنَّةً يَأْتِيهَا رِزْقُهَا رَغَدًا مِّن كُلِّ مَكَانٍ\n(And Allah puts forward the example of a township, that dwelt secure and well-content: its provision coming to it in abundance from every place) until:\nفَأَخَذَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ وَهُمْ ظَـلِمُونَ\n(So the torment overtook them while they were wrongdoers.)

Their land became empty and desolate, and you can see nothing but their dwellings.\nوَكُنَّا نَحْنُ الْوَرِثِينَ\n(And verily, We have been the heirs.) Their towns became ruins, with none remaining. Then Allah tells us of His justice and that He does not destroy anyone unjustly; on the contrary, He destroys those whom He destroys after establishing proof against them. So, he says:\nوَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ مُهْلِكَ الْقُرَى حَتَّى يَبْعَثَ فِى أُمِّهَا\n(And never will your Lord destroy the towns until He sends to their mother town) i.e., Makkah --\nرَسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ ءَايَـتِنَا\n(a Messenger reciting to them Our Ayat.)

(29:25)\nإِذْ تَبَرَّأَ الَّذِينَ اتُّبِعُواْ مِنَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُواْ وَرَأَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ الاٌّسْبَابُ\n(When those who were followed disown those who followed, and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them) until:\nوَمَا هُم بِخَـرِجِينَ مِنَ النَّارِ\n(And they will never get out of the Fire.) (2:166-167). Allah says:\nوَقِيلَ ادْعُواْ شُرَكَآءَكُمْ\n(And it will be said (to them): \"Call upon your partners,\") meaning, `to save you from the predicament you are in, as you hoped that they would do in this world.'\nفَدَعَوْهُمْ فَلَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَهُمْ وَرَأَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ\n(and they will call upon them, but they will give no answer to them, and they will see the torment.) means, they will realize for sure that they are inevitably destined for the Fire. His saying:\nلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ يَهْتَدُونَ\n(If only they had been guided!) means, when they see the punishment with their own eyes, they will wish that they had been among the guided in this world. This is like the Ayah,\nوَيَوْمَ يَقُولُ نَادُواْ شُرَكَآئِىَ الَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ فَدَعَوْهُمْ فَلَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَا بَيْنَهُم مَّوْبِقاً - وَرَأَى الْمُجْرِمُونَ النَّارَ فَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ مُّوَاقِعُوهَا وَلَمْ يَجِدُواْ عَنْهَا مَصْرِفًا\n(And the Day He will say: \"Call those partners of Mine whom you claimed.\" Then they will cry unto them, but they will not answer them, and We shall put a Mawbiq (a barrier) between them.

Allah says:\nفَعَمِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الاٌّنبَـآءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ فَهُمْ لاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(Then the news of a good answer will be obscured to them on that Day, and they will not be able to ask one another.) Mujahid said: \"The proof will be obscured from them,\" so they will not be able to ask one another for help by virtue of their blood ties. Allah's saying:\nفَأَمَّا مَن تَابَ وَءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً\n(But as for him who repented, believed, and did righteous deeds,) means, in this world.\nفَعَسَى أَن يَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُفْلِحِينَ\n(then perhaps he will be among those who are successful.) means, on the Day of Resurrection.

(18:52-53) Their attitude towards the Messengers on the Day of Resurrection\nوَيَوْمَ يُنَـدِيهِمْ فَيَقُولُ مَاذَآ أَجَبْتُمُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(And the Day He will call to them, and say: \"What answer gave you to the Messengers\") The first call will be concerning the issue of Tawhid, which includes evidences of the prophethood -- `What was your response to the Messengers who were sent to you How did you deal with them' This is like the questions which will be asked of a person in his grave: `who is your Lord who is your Prophet and what is your religion' The believer will testify that there is no God except Allah and that Muhammad ﷺ is His servant and Messenger, but the disbelievers will say, \"Oh, oh, I do not know.\" So he will have no answer on the Day of Resurrection except to remain silent, because whoever is blind in this world (i.e., does not see Allah's signs and believes not in Him), will be blind in the Hereafter, and more astray. Allah says:\nفَعَمِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الاٌّنبَـآءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ فَهُمْ لاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(Then the news of a good answer will be obscured to them on that Day, and they will not be able to ask one another.) Mujahid said: \"The proof will be obscured from them,\" so they will not be able to ask one another for help by virtue of their blood ties. Allah's saying:\nفَأَمَّا مَن تَابَ وَءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً\n(But as for him who repented, believed, and did righteous deeds,) means, in this world.\nفَعَسَى أَن يَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُفْلِحِينَ\n(then perhaps he will be among those who are successful.) means, on the Day of Resurrection.

You have left behind you all that which We had bestowed on you. We see not with you your intercessors whom you claimed to be partners with Allah. Now all relations between you and them have been cut off, and all that you used to claim has vanished from you.) (6:94) His saying:\nقَالَ الَّذِينَ حَقَّ عَلَيْهِمُ الْقَوْلُ\n(Those about whom the Word will have been fulfilled) means the Shayatin and evil Jinn, and those who used to advocate disbelief.\nرَبَّنَا هَـؤُلاءِ الَّذِينَ أَغْوَيْنَآ أَغْوَيْنَـهُمْ كَمَا غَوَيْنَا تَبَرَّأْنَآ إِلَيْكَ مَا كَانُواْ إِيَّانَا يَعْبُدُونَ\n(\"Our Lord! These are they whom we led astray. We led them astray, as we were astray ourselves. We declare our innocence before You. It was not us they worshipped.\") They will testify against them and say that they led them astray, then they will declare their innocence of their worship. This is like the Ayat:\nوَاتَّخَذُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ ءالِهَةً لِّيَكُونُواْ لَهُمْ عِزّاً\nكَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدّاً\n(And they have taken gods besides Allah, that they might give them honor, power and glory. Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them.) (19:81-82)\nوَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ - وَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ\n(And who is more astray than one who calls besides Allah, who will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls to them And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.) (46:5-6). Ibrahim Al-Khalil, peace be upon him, said to his people:\nإِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً\n(You have taken idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other.) (29:25)\nإِذْ تَبَرَّأَ الَّذِينَ اتُّبِعُواْ مِنَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُواْ وَرَأَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ الاٌّسْبَابُ\n(When those who were followed disown those who followed, and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them) until:\nوَمَا هُم بِخَـرِجِينَ مِنَ النَّارِ\n(And they will never get out of the Fire.) (2:166-167). Allah says:\nوَقِيلَ ادْعُواْ شُرَكَآءَكُمْ\n(And it will be said (to them): \"Call upon your partners,\") meaning, `to save you from the predicament you are in, as you hoped that they would do in this world.'\nفَدَعَوْهُمْ فَلَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَهُمْ وَرَأَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ\n(and they will call upon them, but they will give no answer to them, and they will see the torment.) means, they will realize for sure that they are inevitably destined for the Fire. His saying:\nلَوْ أَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ يَهْتَدُونَ\n(If only they had been guided!) means, when they see the punishment with their own eyes, they will wish that they had been among the guided in this world. This is like the Ayah,\nوَيَوْمَ يَقُولُ نَادُواْ شُرَكَآئِىَ الَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ فَدَعَوْهُمْ فَلَمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَهُمْ وَجَعَلْنَا بَيْنَهُم مَّوْبِقاً - وَرَأَى الْمُجْرِمُونَ النَّارَ فَظَنُّواْ أَنَّهُمْ مُّوَاقِعُوهَا وَلَمْ يَجِدُواْ عَنْهَا مَصْرِفًا\n(And the Day He will say: \"Call those partners of Mine whom you claimed.\" Then they will cry unto them, but they will not answer them, and We shall put a Mawbiq (a barrier) between them. And the criminals, shall see the Fire and apprehend that they have to fall in it. And they will find no way of escape from there.) (18:52-53) Their attitude towards the Messengers on the Day of Resurrection\nوَيَوْمَ يُنَـدِيهِمْ فَيَقُولُ مَاذَآ أَجَبْتُمُ الْمُرْسَلِينَ\n(And the Day He will call to them, and say: \"What answer gave you to the Messengers\") The first call will be concerning the issue of Tawhid, which includes evidences of the prophethood -- `What was your response to the Messengers who were sent to you How did you deal with them' This is like the questions which will be asked of a person in his grave: `who is your Lord who is your Prophet and what is your religion' The believer will testify that there is no God except Allah and that Muhammad ﷺ is His servant and Messenger, but the disbelievers will say, \"Oh, oh, I do not know.\" So he will have no answer on the Day of Resurrection except to remain silent, because whoever is blind in this world (i.e., does not see Allah's signs and believes not in Him), will be blind in the Hereafter, and more astray. Allah says:\nفَعَمِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الاٌّنبَـآءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ فَهُمْ لاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(Then the news of a good answer will be obscured to them on that Day, and they will not be able to ask one another.) Mujahid said: \"The proof will be obscured from them,\" so they will not be able to ask one another for help by virtue of their blood ties. Allah's saying:\nفَأَمَّا مَن تَابَ وَءَامَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَـلِحاً\n(But as for him who repented, believed, and did righteous deeds,) means, in this world.\nفَعَسَى أَن يَكُونَ مِنَ الْمُفْلِحِينَ\n(then perhaps he will be among those who are successful.) means, on the Day of Resurrection.

This is understood to mean that if his intention is to show off and appear better than others, then that is to be condemned, as it was reported in the Sahih that the Prophet said:\n«إِنَّهُ أُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ أَنْ تَوَاضَعُوا حَتَّى لَا يَفْخَرَ أَحَدٌ عَلَى أَحَدٍ وَلَا يَبْغِي أَحَدٌ عَلَى أَحَد»\n(It has been revealed to me that you should be humble to the extent that none of you boasts to others or mistreats others. ) But if a person simply likes to look good, then there is nothing wrong with that. It was recorded that a man said: \"O Messenger of Allah, I like to have my garment looking good and my shoes looking good -- is this a kind of arrogance\" The Prophet said:\n«لَا، إِنَّ اللهَ جَمِيلٌ يُحِبُّ الْجَمَال»\n(No, for Allah is beautiful and loves beauty...) And Allah says:\nمَن جَآءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ\n(Whosoever brings good,) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection,\nفَلَهُ خَيْرٌ مِّنْهَا\n(he shall have the better thereof;) meaning, the reward of Allah is better than the good deeds of His servant -- how can it not be, when Allah has multiplied it many times over This is the position of generosity. Then Allah says:\nوَمَن جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلاَ يُجْزَى الَّذِينَ عَمِلُواْ السَّيِّئَاتِ إِلاَّ مَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ\n(and whosoever brings evil, then those who do evil deeds will only be requited for what they used to do.) This is like the Ayah,\nوَمَن جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَكُبَّتْ وُجُوهُهُمْ فِى النَّارِ هَلْ تُجْزَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ\n(And whoever brings an evil deed, they will be cast down on their faces in the Fire. (And it will be said to them) \"Are you being recompensed anything except what you used to do\") (27: 90). This is the postition of generosity and justice."},{"SurahNumber":28,"VerseNumber":85,"Text":"The Command to convey the Message of Tawhid\nHere Allah commands His Messenger to convey the Message and recite the Qur'an to people.

He said, \"Back to your place of birth in Makkah.\" Ibn `Abbas is also reported to have interpreted it variously referring to death, to the Day of Resurrection which will come after death, and to Paradise which will be his reward and his destiny for putting the Message of Allah into practice and conveying it to the humans and Jinns, and because he is the most perfect, most eloquent and most noble of all the creation of Allah.

So He says:\nوَادْعُ إِلَى رَبِّكَ\n(and invite to your Lord) to worship your Lord Alone, with no partners or associates,\nوَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكَينَ\n(and be not of idolators.)\nوَلاَ تَدْعُ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهاً ءَاخَرَ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ\n(And invoke not any other god along with Allah, there is no God but Him.) means, it is not appropriate to worship anything or anybody except Him, and divinity does not befit any except His glory.\nكُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلاَّ وَجْهَهُ\n(Everything will perish save His Face.) Here Allah is telling us that He is Eternal, Ever Lasting, Ever Living, Self-Sustaining, Who, although His creation dies, He will never die, as He says:\nكُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ - وَيَبْقَى وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلْـلِ وَالإِكْرَامِ\n(Whatsoever is on it will perish. And the Face of your Lord full of majesty and honor will remain forever.) (55:26-27). Allah used the word \"Face\" to refer to Himself, as He says here:\nكُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلاَّ وَجْهَهُ\n(Everything will perish save His Face.) meaning, everything except Him. It was reported in the Sahih via Abu Salamah that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«أَصْدَقُ كَلِمَةٍ قَالَهَا الشَّاعِرُ لَبِيدُ أَلَا كُلُّ شَيْءٍ مَا خَلَا اللهَ بَاطِلُ »\n(The truest word of a poet was the saying of Labid - indeed everything except Allah is false.)\nلَهُ الْحُكْمُ\n(His is the decision,) means, dominion and control, and there is none who can reverse His judgement or decision.\nوَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ\n(and to Him you shall be returned.) means, on the Day when you will be brought back, and He will reward or punish you according to your deeds: if they are good, then you will be rewarded, and if they are bad, then you will be punished. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Qasas. To Allah be praise and blessings."}]}
