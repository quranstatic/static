Allah the Exalted and Most Honored revealed this Ayah,\nقَدْ سَمِعَ اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّتِى تُجَادِلُكَ فِى زَوْجِهَا\n(Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her that disputes with you concerning her husband.)\" till the end of this Ayah. Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith without a chain of narration in the Book of Tawhid in his Sahih. An-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir also collected this Hadith. In the narration that Ibn Abi Hatim collected, `A'ishah said, \"Blessed is He, Whose hearing has encompassed all things. I heard what Khawlah bint Tha`labah said while some of it I could not hear. She was complaining to Allah's Messenger ﷺ about her husband. She said, `O Allah's Messenger! He spent my wealth, exhausted my youth and my womb bore abundantly for him. When I be- came old, unable to bear children, he pronounced the Ziharon me! O Allah! I complain to you.' Soon after, Jibril brought down this Ayah,\nقَدْ سَمِعَ اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّتِى تُجَادِلُكَ فِى زَوْجِهَا\n(Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her that disputes with you concerning her husband,)\" She added, \"Her husband was Aws bin As-Samit.\""},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Az-Zihar and the Atonement for It Imam\nAhmad recorded that Khuwaylah bint Tha`labah said, \"By Allah! Allah sent down the beginning of Surat Al-Mujadilah in connection with me and `Aws bin As-Samit. He was my husband and had grown old and difficult. One day, he came to me and I argued with him about something and he said, out of anger, `You are like my mother's back to me.' He went out and sat with some of his people. Then he came back and wanted to have sexual intercourse with me. I said, `No, by the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Khuwaylah! You will not have your way with me after you said what you said, until Allah and His Messenger issue judgement about our case.' He wanted to have his way regardless of my choice and I pushed him away from me; he was an old man.' I next went to one of my neighbors and borrowed a garment from her and went to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. I told him what happened and kept complaining to him of the ill treatment I received from `Aws. He said,\n«يَاخُوَيْلَةُ، ابْنُ عَمِّكِ شَيْخٌ كَبِيرٌ، فَاتَّقِي اللهَ فِيه»\n(O Khuwaylah! Your cousin is an old man, so have Taqwa of Allah regarding him.) By Allah! Before I departed, parts of the Qur'an were revealed about me. Allah's Messenger ﷺ felt the hardship upon receiving the revelation as he usually did and then became relieved. He said to me,\n«يَا خُوَيْلَةُ، قَدْ أَنْزَلَ اللهُ فِيكِ وَفِي صَاحِبِكِ قُرْآنًا»\n(O Khuwaylah! Allah has revealed something about you and your spouse.) He recited to me,\nقَدْ سَمِعَ اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّتِى تُجَادِلُكَ فِى زَوْجِهَا وَتَشْتَكِى إِلَى اللَّهِ وَاللَّهُ يَسْمَعُ تَحَاوُرَكُمآ إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ بَصِيرٌ\n(Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her that disputes with you concerning her husband, and complains to Allah. And Allah hears the argument between you both. Verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer.), until,\nوَلِلكَـفِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(And for disbelievers, there is a painful torment.) He then said to me,\n«مُرِيهِ فَلْيُعْتِقْ رَقَبَة»\n(Command him to free a slave.) I said, `O Allah's Messenger! He does not have any to free.' He said,\n«فَلْيَصُمْ شَهْرَيْنِ مُتَتَابِعَيْن»\n(Let him fast for two consecutive months.) I said, `By Allah! He is an old man and cannot fast.' He said,\n«فَلْيُطْعِمْ سِتِّينَ مِسْكِينًا وَسْقًا مِنْ تَمْر»\n(Let him feed sixty poor people a Wasq of dates.) I said, `O Allah's Messenger! By Allah, he does not have any of that.' He said,\n«فَإِنَّا سَنُعِينُهُ بِعَرَقٍ مِنْ تَمْر»\n(We will help him with a basket of dates.) I said, `And I, O Allah's Messenger! I will help him with another.' He said,\n«قَدْ أَصَبْتِ وَأَحْسَنْتِ فَاذْهَبِي فَتَصَدَّقِي بِهِ عَنْهُ، ثُمَّ اسْتَوْصِي بِابْنِ عَمِّكِ خَيْرًا»\n(You have done a righteously good thing. So go and give away the dates on his behalf and take care of your cousin.) I did that.\"' Abu Dawud also collected this Hadith in the Book of Divorce in his Sunan, according to which her name is Khawlah bint Tha`labah. She is also known as Khawlah bint Malik bin Tha`labah, and Khuwaylah. All these are close to each other, and Allah knows best. This is what is correct about the reason behind revealing this Surah. Therefore, Allah's statement,\nالَّذِينَ يُظَـهِرُونَ مِنكُمْ مِّن نِّسَآئِهِمْ\n(Those among you who make their wives unlawful to them by Zihar) refers to Zihar, which is derived from Az-Zahr, meaning, the back. During the time of Jahiliyyah, when one wanted to declare Zihar towards his wife, he would say, \"To me, you are like the back of my mother.\" That was one way they issued divorce during that time. Allah allowed this Ummah to pay expiation for this statement and did not render it as a divorce, contrary to the case during the time of Jahiliyyah. Allah said,\nمَّا هُنَّ أُمَّهَـتِهِمْ إِنْ أُمَّهَـتُهُمْ إِلاَّ اللاَّئِى وَلَدْنَهُمْ\n(they cannot be their mothers. None can be their mothers except those who gave them birth.) meaning, when the husband says to his wife that she is like his mother, or the back of his mother etc., she does not become his mother. Rather his mother is she who gave birth to him. This is why Allah said,\nوَإِنَّهُمْ لَيَقُولُونَ مُنكَراً مِّنَ الْقَوْلِ وَزُوراً\n(And verily, they utter an ill word and a lie.) meaning, false and sinful speech,\nوَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٌ\n(And verily, Allah is Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.) meaning, `what you used to do during the time of Jahiliyyah, and what accidentally slips out of your mouth, unintentionally.' Allah's statement,\nوَالَّذِينَ يُظَـهِرُونَ مِن نِّسَآئِهِمْ ثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ لِمَا قَالُواْ\n(And those who make unlawful to them (their wives) by Zihar and wish to free themselves from what they uttered,) Ash-Shafi`i said, \"It means to keep her for a while after the Zihar, without divorcing her, even though his is able to do so.\" Ahmad bin Hanbal said, \"To return to having sexual relations with her or to merely intend to do so, but only after he pays the expiation mentioned in the Ayah for his statement.\" It has been quoted from Malik that it is the intention to have sexual relations or to keep her or actually having sexual intercourse. Sa`id bin Jubayr said that this Ayah,\nثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ لِمَا قَالُواْ\n(and wish to free themselves from what they uttered,) meaning, if they want to return to having sexual intercourse which was forbidden between them. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said that it is to utilize her sexual organ, and he did not see any harm in doing what is less than that before paying the expiation. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas:\nمِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَتَمَآسَّا\n(before they touch each other.) \"The `touching' refers here to sexual intercourse.\" Similar was said by `Ata', Az-Zuhri, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan. Az-Zuhri added, \"He is not to kiss or touch her until he pays the expiation.\" The Sunan compilers recorded from `Ikrimah, from Ibn `Abbas that a man said, \"O Allah's Messenger! I pronounced Zihar on my wife, but then had sexual intercourse with her before I paid the expiation.\" The Messenger ﷺ said,\n«مَا حَمَلَكَ عَلى ذَلِكَ يَرْحَمُكَ الله»\n(May Allah grant you His mercy, what made you do that) He said, \"I saw the adornment she was wearing shining in the moon's light.\" The Prophet said,\n«فَلَا تَقْرَبْهَا حَتْى تَفْعَلَ مَا أَمَرَكَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَل»\n(Then do not touch her until you do what Allah the Exalted and Most Honored has ordered you to do.) At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Gharib Sahih.\" Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i also recorded it. Allah said,\nفَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ\n((the penalty) in that case is the freeing of a slave) indicating the necessity of freeing a slave before they touch each other. This Ayah mentions any slave, not only believing servants as in the case of the expiation for (unintentional) killing,\nذَلِكُمْ تُوعَظُونَ بِهِ\n(That is an admonition to you.) meaning, a warning to threaten you in this case.\nوَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ\n(And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) meaning, He is All-Knower in what brings you benefit. Allah's statement,\nفَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ شَهْرَيْنِ مُتَتَابِعَيْنِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَتَمَآسَّا فَمَن لَّمْ يَسْتَطِعْ فَإِطْعَامُ سِتِّينَ مِسْكِيناً\n(And he who finds not must fast two successive months before they both touch each other. And he who is unable to do so, should feed sixty of the poor.) is explained by the Hadiths that prescribe these punishments in this order, just as in the Hadith collected in the Two Sahihs about the man who had sexual intercourse with his wife during the day, in Ramadan. Allah said,\nذَلِكَ لِتُؤْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ\n(That is in order that you may have perfect faith in Allah and His Messenger.) meaning, `We legislated this punishment so that you acquire this trait,'\nوَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ\n(These are the limits set by Allah.) meaning, the things that He has forbidden, so do not transgress them,\nوَلِلكَـفِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(And for disbelievers, there is a painful torment.) meaning, those who do not believe and do not abide by the rulings of Islamic legislation should never think they will be saved from the torment. Rather theirs will be a painful torment in this life and the Hereafter."},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Az-Zihar and the Atonement for It Imam\nAhmad recorded that Khuwaylah bint Tha`labah said, \"By Allah!

At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Gharib Sahih.\" Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i also recorded it. Allah said,\nفَتَحْرِيرُ رَقَبَةٍ\n((the penalty) in that case is the freeing of a slave) indicating the necessity of freeing a slave before they touch each other. This Ayah mentions any slave, not only believing servants as in the case of the expiation for (unintentional) killing,\nذَلِكُمْ تُوعَظُونَ بِهِ\n(That is an admonition to you.) meaning, a warning to threaten you in this case.\nوَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ\n(And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) meaning, He is All-Knower in what brings you benefit. Allah's statement,\nفَمَن لَّمْ يَجِدْ فَصِيَامُ شَهْرَيْنِ مُتَتَابِعَيْنِ مِن قَبْلِ أَن يَتَمَآسَّا فَمَن لَّمْ يَسْتَطِعْ فَإِطْعَامُ سِتِّينَ مِسْكِيناً\n(And he who finds not must fast two successive months before they both touch each other. And he who is unable to do so, should feed sixty of the poor.) is explained by the Hadiths that prescribe these punishments in this order, just as in the Hadith collected in the Two Sahihs about the man who had sexual intercourse with his wife during the day, in Ramadan. Allah said,\nذَلِكَ لِتُؤْمِنُواْ بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ\n(That is in order that you may have perfect faith in Allah and His Messenger.) meaning, `We legislated this punishment so that you acquire this trait,'\nوَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ\n(These are the limits set by Allah.) meaning, the things that He has forbidden, so do not transgress them,\nوَلِلكَـفِرِينَ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(And for disbelievers, there is a painful torment.) meaning, those who do not believe and do not abide by the rulings of Islamic legislation should never think they will be saved from the torment.

When one of the Prophet's Companions would pass by a gathering of Jews, they would speak among themselves in secret, prompting the believer to think that they were plotting to kill or harm him. When the believer saw this, he feared for his safety and changed the route he was taking. The Prophet advised them to abandon their evil secret talks, but they did not listen and kept on holding the Najwa.

So I said to them, `wa `Alaykum As-Sam (the same death be upon you).' The Prophet said,\n«يَا عَائِشَةُ إِنَّ اللهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الْفُحْشَ وَلَا التَّفَحُّش»\n(O `A'ishah, Allah does not like rudeness and foul speech.)

Ibn Jarir recorded that Anas bin Malik said, \"A Jew passed by Allah's Messenger , who was sitting with his Companions, he greeted them and they greeted him back. Allah's Messenger ﷺ then said to his Companions,\n«هَلْ تَدْرُونَ مَا قَالَ؟»\n(Do you know what he just said) They said, `He said: As-Salam, O Allah's Messenger.' The Prophet said,\n«بَلْ قَالَ: سَامٌ عَلَيْكُم»\n(Rather he said, Sam `Alaykum.) meaning, `may you disgrace your religion.' Allah's Messenger ﷺ then said,\n«رُدُّوه»\n(Bring him back,) and when he was brought back, the Prophet asked him,\n«أَقُلْتَ: سَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ؟»\n(Did you say: Sam `Alaykum) He said, `Yes.' The Prophet then said,\n«إِذَا سَلَّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ أَحَدٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ فَقُولُوا: عَلَيْك»\n(When the people of the Book greet you, say, `Wa `Alaykum.')\" meaning, `and the same on you too.' The basis for the Hadith of Anas is in the Sahih and similar to this Hadith of `A'ishah is in the Sahih. Allah said,\nوَيَقُولُونَ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ لَوْلاَ يُعَذِّبُنَا اللَّهُ بِمَا نَقُولُ\n(and say within themselves:\"Why should Allah punish us not for what we say\") means, the Jews say these words, changing the meaning of the Islamic greeting, into an abusive statement, and then say, `Had he been a Prophet, Allah would have punished us for what we said. Allah knows what we conceal. Therefore, if Muhammad ﷺ were a Prophet, Allah would have sent His punishment on us sooner, in this life.' Allah the Exalted replied,\nحَسْبُهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ\n(Hell will be sufficient for them;) ell should be sufficient for them in the Hereafter,\nيَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ\n(they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Jews used to say, \"Sam `Alayka,\" to Allah's Messenger ﷺ. They would say then within themselves, \"Why does Allah not punish us for what we say\" This Ayah was later revealed,\nوَإِذَا جَآءُوكَ حَيَّوْكَ بِمَا لَمْ يُحَيِّكَ بِهِ اللَّهُ وَيَقُولُونَ فِى أَنفُسِهِمْ لَوْلاَ يُعَذِّبُنَا اللَّهُ بِمَا نَقُولُ حَسْبُهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ يَصْلَوْنَهَا فَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ\n(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not, and say within themselves: \"Why should Allah punish us not for what we say\" Hell will be sufficient for them; they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) Its chain of narration is Hasan, but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not collect it.\nManners of the Najwa, (Secret Counsel)\nAllah the Exalted teaches His believing servants to avoid the ways of the disbelievers and hypocrites,\nيأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِذَا تَنَاجَيْتُمْ فَلاَ تَتَنَـجَوْاْ بِالإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَمَعْصِيَةِ الرَّسُولِ\n(O you who believe! When you hold secret counsel, do it not for sin and wrongdoing, and disobedience to the Messenger,) meaning, do not hold evil secret counsels like the ignorant disbelieving People of the Scriptures and their allies among the hypocrites, who imitate their ways,\nوَتَنَـجَوْاْ بِالْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ الَّذِى إِلَيْهِ تُحْشَرُونَ\n(but do it for Al-Birr and Taqwa; and have Taqwa of Allah unto Whom you shall be gathered.) and He will then inform you of all your deeds and statements; He has counted and recorded them and will justly hold you accountable for them. Allah the Exalted said,\nإِنَّمَا النَّجْوَى مِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ لِيَحْزُنَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَلَيْسَ بِضَآرِّهِمْ شَيْئاً إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللَّهِ وَعَلَى اللَّهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ\n(An-Najwa are only from the Shaytan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allah permits. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.) Allah states that secret talks, where the believers feel anxious, are\nمِنَ الشَّيْطَـنِ لِيَحْزُنَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ\n(only from Shaytan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers.) meaning, that those who hold such counsels do so because of the lures of the devil,\nلِيَحْزُنَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ\n(in order that he may cause grief to the believers.) The devil seeks to bother the believers, even though his plots will not harm the believers, except if Allah wills it. Those who are the subject of evil Najwa, should seek refuge in Allah and put his trust in Him, for none of it will harm them, Allah willing. The Sunnah also forbids the Najwa so that no Muslim is bothered by it. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِذَا كُنْتُمْ ثَلَاثَةً فَلَا يَتَنَاجَى اثْنَانِ دُونَ صَاحِبِهِمَا، فَإِنَّ ذلِكَ يُحْزِنُه»\n(If you were three, then two of you should not hold a secret counsel in the presence of the third person, because that would cause him to be worried.) This Hadith is collected in the Two Sahihs using a chain of narration that contained Al-A`mash. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,\n«إِذَا كُنْتُمْ ثَلَاثَةً فَلَا يَتَنَاجَى اثْنَانِ دُونَ الثَّالِثِ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ، فَإِنَّ ذلِكَ يُحْزِنُه»\n(If you were three, then two of you should not hold a secret counsel in the presence of the third person, except with his permission, because that would cause him to be worried.) Muslim collected this Hadith."},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"The Evil of the Jews\nIbn Abi Najih reported from Mujahid,\nأَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ نُهُواْ عَنِ النَّجْوَى ثُمَّ يَعُودُونَ لِمَا نُهُواْ عَنْهُ\n(Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden,) He said, \"The Jews.\" Similar was said by Muqatil bin Hayyan, who added, \"The Prophet had a peace treaty with the Jews.

Surely, Allah helps the servant as long as the servant helps his brother.) There are many similar Hadiths. This is why Allah the Exalted said,\nفَافْسَحُواْ يَفْسَحِ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ\n(make room. Allah will give you room.) Qatadah said, \"This Ayah was revealed about gatherings in places where Allah is being remembered. When someone would come to join in assemblies with the Messenger , they would hesitate to offer them space so that they would not loose their places. Allah the Exalted commanded them to spread out and make room for each other.\" Imam Ahmad and Imam Ash-Shafi`i recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«لَا يُقِمِ الرَّجُلُ الرَّجُلَ مِنْ مَجْلِسِهِ فَيَجْلِسَ فِيهِ، وَلَكِنْ تَفَسَّحُوا وَتَوَسَّعُوا»\n(One of you should not remove someone from his place and sit in it, but instead, spread out and make room.) This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,\n«لَا يُقِمِ الرَّجُلُ الرَّجُلَ مِنْ مَجْلِسِهِ ثُمَّ يَجْلِسُ فِيهِ، وَلَكِنِ افْسَحُوا يَفْسَحِ اللهُ لَكُم»\n(A man should not remove another man from his place and then sit in it. Rather spread out and make room and Allah will make room for you.) Imam Ahmad also recorded this Hadith with the wording:\n«لَا يَقُومُ الرَّجُلُ لِلرَّجُلِ مِنْ مَجْلِسِهِ، وَلَكِنِ افْسَحُوا يَفْسَحِ اللهُ لَكُم»\n(A man should not leave his place for another man, but rather spread out and make room, and Allah will make room for you).\" It has been reported that Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan Al-Basri and others said that:\nإِذَا قِيلَ لَكُمْ تَفَسَّحُواْ فِى الْمَجَـلِسِ فَافْسَحُواْ يَفْسَحِ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ\n(When you are told to make room in the assemblies, make room. Allah will give you room.) means to war assemblies, and that,\nوَإِذَا قِيلَ انشُزُواْ فَانشُزُواْ\n(And when you are told to rise up, then rise up.) means, \"Get up to fight.\" Qatadah said\nوَإِذَا قِيلَ انشُزُواْ فَانشُزُواْ\n(And when you are told to rise up, then rise up.) means, \"When you are called to any type of good, then respond.\"\nThe Virtues of Knowledge and People of Knowledge\nAllah's statement,\nيَرْفَعِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مِنكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْعِلْمَ دَرَجَـتٍ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ\n(Allah will exalt in degrees those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge. And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do.) means, do not think that if one of you makes room for his brother, or rises up when he is commanded to do so, that this will diminish his right or honor. Rather, this will increase his virtue and status with Allah, and Allah the Exalted will never make his good deed be lost. To the contrary, He will reward him for it in this life and the Hereafter. Surely, he who humbles himself by and before the command of his Lord, then Allah will elevate his status and make him known by his good behavior. the statement of Allah the Exalted,\nيَرْفَعِ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مِنكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْعِلْمَ دَرَجَـتٍ وَاللَّهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرٌ\nm(Allah will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge. And Allah is Well--Acquainted with what you do.) meaning, surely, Allah is Aware of those who deserve this reward and those who are not worthy of it. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu At-Tufayl `Amir bin Wathilah said that Nafi` bin `Abdul--Harith met `Umar bin Al-Khattab in the area of `Usfan. `Umar appointed Abu At-Tufayl to be the governor of Makkah. `Umar asked him, \"Whom did you appoint as your deputy for the valley people (that is, Makkah).\" `Amir said, \"I appointed Ibn Abza, one of our freed slaves, as my deputy.\" `Umar said, \"You made a freed slave their governor in your absence\" He said, \"O Leader of the faithful! He has memorized Allah's Book and has knowledge of regulations of inheritance, along with being a proficient judge.\" `Umar said, \"Surely, your Prophet has said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ يَرْفَعُ بِهذَا الْكِتَابِ قَوْمًا وَيَضَعُ بِهِ آخَرِين»\n(Verily, Allah elevates some people and degrades others, on account of this Book.)\" Muslim collected this Hadith."},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"The Order to give Charity before One speaks to the Prophet in private\nAllah commanded His believing servants, when any of them wanted to speak with Allah's Messenger ﷺ in secret, to give away charity beforehand so that his charity cleanses and purifies him and makes him worthy of having a private counsel with the Prophet . This is why Allah the Exalted said,\nذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَأَطْهَرُ\n(That will be better and purer for you.) then He said,\nفَإِن لَّمْ تَجِدُواْ\n(But if you find not.) meaning, if he is unable to do so due to poverty,\nفَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ\n(then verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) He only commanded those who are financially able to give this type of charity.

And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) Therefore, Allah abrogated the obligation of giving this charity. It was said that none has implemented this command before except its abrogation, `Ali bin Abi Talib. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas:\nفَقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ نَجْوَكُمْ صَدَقَةً\n(spend something in charity before your private consultation.) \"The Muslims kept asking Allah's Messenger ﷺ questions until it became difficult on him. Allah wanted to lighten the burden from His Prophet , upon him be peace. So when He said this, many Muslims were afraid to pay this charity and stopped asking. Afterwards, Allah sent down this Ayah,\nأَءَشْفَقْتُمْ أَن تُقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ نَجْوَكُمْ صَدَقَـتٍ فَإِذْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَتَابَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فَأَقِيمُواْ الصَّلوةَ وَءَاتُواْ الزَّكَوةَ\n(Are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultation If then you do it not, and Allah has forgiven you, then perform Salah and give Zakah) Thus Allah made things easy and lenient for them.\" `Ikrimah and Al-Hasan Al-Basri commented on Allah's statement:\nفَقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ نَجْوَكُمْ صَدَقَةً\n(spend something in charity before your private consultation.) \"This was abrogated by the next Ayah:\nأَءَشْفَقْتُمْ أَن تُقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ نَجْوَكُمْ صَدَقَـتٍ\n(Are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultation...).\" Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah reported from Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan, \"People kept questioning Allah's Messenger ﷺ until they made things difficult for him. Allah provided a way to stop their behavior by this Ayah. One of them would need to speak to Allah's Prophet about a real matter, but could not do so until he gave in charity. This became hard on people and Allah sent down relief from this requirement afterwards,\nفَإِن لَّمْ تَجِدُواْ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ\n(But if you find not, then verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful).\" Ma`mar reported from Qatadah that the Ayah,\nإِذَا نَـجَيْتُمُ الرَّسُولَ فَقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ نَجْوَكُمْ صَدَقَةً\n(When you (want to) consult the Messenger in private, spend something in charity before your private consultation.) was abrogated after being in effect for only one hour of a day. `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that Mujahid said that `Ali said, \"No one except me implemented this Ayah, until it was abrogated,\" and he was reported to have said that it remained in effect for merely an hour."},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"The Order to give Charity before One speaks to the Prophet in private\nAllah commanded His believing servants, when any of them wanted to speak with Allah's Messenger ﷺ in secret, to give away charity beforehand so that his charity cleanses and purifies him and makes him worthy of having a private counsel with the Prophet . This is why Allah the Exalted said,\nذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ وَأَطْهَرُ\n(That will be better and purer for you.) then He said,\nفَإِن لَّمْ تَجِدُواْ\n(But if you find not.) meaning, if he is unable to do so due to poverty,\nفَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ\n(then verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) He only commanded those who are financially able to give this type of charity. Allah the Exalted said,\nأَءَشْفَقْتُمْ أَن تُقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ نَجْوَكُمْ صَدَقَـتٍ\n(Are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultation) meaning, are you afraid that the order to give charity before speaking privately to the Prophet remains in effect forever\nفَإِذْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَتَابَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فَأَقِيمُواْ الصَّلوةَ وَءَاتُواْ الزَّكَوةَ وَأَطِيعُواْ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَاللَّهُ خَبِيرٌ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ\n(If then you do it not, and Allah has forgiven you, then perform Salah and give Zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.) Therefore, Allah abrogated the obligation of giving this charity. It was said that none has implemented this command before except its abrogation, `Ali bin Abi Talib. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas:\nفَقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ نَجْوَكُمْ صَدَقَةً\n(spend something in charity before your private consultation.) \"The Muslims kept asking Allah's Messenger ﷺ questions until it became difficult on him. Allah wanted to lighten the burden from His Prophet , upon him be peace. So when He said this, many Muslims were afraid to pay this charity and stopped asking. Afterwards, Allah sent down this Ayah,\nأَءَشْفَقْتُمْ أَن تُقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ نَجْوَكُمْ صَدَقَـتٍ فَإِذْ لَمْ تَفْعَلُواْ وَتَابَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فَأَقِيمُواْ الصَّلوةَ وَءَاتُواْ الزَّكَوةَ\n(Are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultation If then you do it not, and Allah has forgiven you, then perform Salah and give Zakah) Thus Allah made things easy and lenient for them.\" `Ikrimah and Al-Hasan Al-Basri commented on Allah's statement:\nفَقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ نَجْوَكُمْ صَدَقَةً\n(spend something in charity before your private consultation.) \"This was abrogated by the next Ayah:\nأَءَشْفَقْتُمْ أَن تُقَدِّمُواْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ نَجْوَكُمْ صَدَقَـتٍ\n(Are you afraid of spending in charity before your private consultation...).\" Sa`id bin Abi `Arubah reported from Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan, \"People kept questioning Allah's Messenger ﷺ until they made things difficult for him.

Allah rebukes this idea of theirs;\nأَلاَ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْكَـذِبُونَ\n(Verily, they are liars!) stressing that they are lying, Allah then said;\nاسْتَحْوَذَ عَلَيْهِمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ فَأَنسَـهُمْ ذِكْرَ اللَّهِ\n(The Shaytan has overpowered them. So he has made them forget the remembrance of Allah.) meaning, Shaytan has taken over their hearts to the point that he made them forget Allah the Exalted and Most Honored.

And Allah guides not the people who are the rebellious.)(9:24) Sa`id bin `Abdul-`Aziz and others said that this Ayah,\nلاَّ تَجِدُ قَوْماً يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ\n(You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day...) was revealed in the case of Abu `Ubaydah `Amir bin `Abdullah bin Al-Jarrah when he killed his disbelieving father, during the battle of Badr. This is why when `Umar bin Al-Khattab placed the matter of Khilafah in the consultation of six men after him, he said; \"If Abu `Ubaydah were alive, I would have appointed him the Khalifah.\" It was also said that the Ayah,\nوَلَوْ كَانُواْ ءَابَآءَهُمْ\n(even though they were their fathers), was revealed in the case of Abu `Ubaydah, when he killed his father during the battle of Badr, while the Ayah,\nأَوْ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ\n(or their sons) was revealed in the case of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq when he intended to kill his (disbelieving) son, `Abdur-Rahman, (during Badr), while the Ayah,\nأَوْ إِخْوَنَهُمْ\n(or their brothers) was revealed about the case of Mus`ab bin `Umayr, who killed his brother, `Ubayd bin `Umayr, during Badr, and that the Ayah,\nأَوْ عَشِيرَتَهُمْ\n(or their kindred) was revealed about the case of `Umar, who killed one of his relatives during Badr, and also that this Ayah was revealed in the case of Hamzah, `Ali and Ubaydah bin Al-Harith. They killed their close relatives `Utbah, Shaybah and Al-Walid bin `Utbah that day. Allah knows best. A similar matter is when Allah's Messenger ﷺ consulted with his Companions about what should be done with the captives of Badr. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq thought that they should accept ransom for them so the Muslims could use the money to strengthen themselves. He mentioned the fact that the captured were the cousins and the kindred, and that they might embrace Islam later on, by Allah's help. `Umar said, \"But I have a different opinion, O Allah's Messenger! Let me kill so-and-so, my relative, and let `Ali kill `Aqil (`Ali's brother), and so-and-so kill so-and-so. Let us make it known to Allah that we have no mercy in our hearts for the idolators.\" Allah said,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ كَتَبَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ الإِيمَـنَ وَأَيَّدَهُمْ بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ\n(For such He has written faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Ruh from Himself.) means, those who have the quality of not befriending those who oppose Allah and His Messenger , even if they are their fathers or brothers, are those whom Allah has decreed faith, meaning, happiness, in their hearts and made faith dear to their hearts and happiness reside therein. As-Suddi said that the Ayah,\nكَتَبَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ الإِيمَـنَ\n(He has written faith in their hearts,) means, \"He has placed faith in their hearts.\" Ibn `Abbas said that,\nوَأَيَّدَهُمْ بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ\n(and strengthened them with Ruh from Himself.) means, \"He gave them strengths.\" Allah's statement,\nوَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا رَضِىَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُواْ عَنْهُ\n(And He will admit them to Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein. Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him.) was explained several times before. Allah's statement,\nرِّضِىَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُواْ عَنْهُ\n(Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him.) contains a beautiful secret. When the believers became enraged against their relatives and kindred in Allah's cause, He compensated them by being pleased with them and making them pleased with Him from what He has granted them of eternal delight, ultimate victory and encompassing favor. Allah's statement,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ حِزْبُ اللَّهِ أَلاَ إِنَّ حِزْبَ اللَّهِ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ\n(They are the party of Allah. Verily, the party of Allah will be the successful.) indicates that they are the party of Allah, meaning, His servants who are worthy of earning His honor. Allah's statement,\nأَلاَ إِنَّ حِزْبَ اللَّهِ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ\n(Verily, the party of Allah will be the successful.) asserts their success, happiness and triumph in this life and the Hereafter, in contrast to those, who are the party of the devil,\nأَلاَ إِنَّ حِزْبَ الشَّيْطَـنِ هُمُ الخَـسِرُونَ\n(Verily, the party of Shaytan will be the losers!)

(3:28), and,\nقُلْ إِن كَانَ ءَابَاؤُكُمْ وَأَبْنَآؤُكُمْ وَإِخْوَنُكُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ وَعَشِيرَتُكُمْ وَأَمْوَلٌ اقْتَرَفْتُمُوهَا وَتِجَـرَةٌ تَخْشَوْنَ كَسَادَهَا وَمَسَـكِنُ تَرْضَوْنَهَآ أَحَبَّ إِلَيْكُمْ مِّنَ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَجِهَادٍ فِي سَبِيلِهِ فَتَرَبَّصُواْ حَتَّى يَأْتِىَ اللَّهُ بِأَمْرِهِ وَاللَّهُ لاَ يَهْدِى الْقَوْمَ الْفَـسِقِينَ\n(Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allah brings about His decision (torment). And Allah guides not the people who are the rebellious.)(9:24) Sa`id bin `Abdul-`Aziz and others said that this Ayah,\nلاَّ تَجِدُ قَوْماً يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ\n(You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day...) was revealed in the case of Abu `Ubaydah `Amir bin `Abdullah bin Al-Jarrah when he killed his disbelieving father, during the battle of Badr. This is why when `Umar bin Al-Khattab placed the matter of Khilafah in the consultation of six men after him, he said; \"If Abu `Ubaydah were alive, I would have appointed him the Khalifah.\" It was also said that the Ayah,\nوَلَوْ كَانُواْ ءَابَآءَهُمْ\n(even though they were their fathers), was revealed in the case of Abu `Ubaydah, when he killed his father during the battle of Badr, while the Ayah,\nأَوْ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ\n(or their sons) was revealed in the case of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq when he intended to kill his (disbelieving) son, `Abdur-Rahman, (during Badr), while the Ayah,\nأَوْ إِخْوَنَهُمْ\n(or their brothers) was revealed about the case of Mus`ab bin `Umayr, who killed his brother, `Ubayd bin `Umayr, during Badr, and that the Ayah,\nأَوْ عَشِيرَتَهُمْ\n(or their kindred) was revealed about the case of `Umar, who killed one of his relatives during Badr, and also that this Ayah was revealed in the case of Hamzah, `Ali and Ubaydah bin Al-Harith. They killed their close relatives `Utbah, Shaybah and Al-Walid bin `Utbah that day. Allah knows best. A similar matter is when Allah's Messenger ﷺ consulted with his Companions about what should be done with the captives of Badr. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq thought that they should accept ransom for them so the Muslims could use the money to strengthen themselves. He mentioned the fact that the captured were the cousins and the kindred, and that they might embrace Islam later on, by Allah's help. `Umar said, \"But I have a different opinion, O Allah's Messenger! Let me kill so-and-so, my relative, and let `Ali kill `Aqil (`Ali's brother), and so-and-so kill so-and-so. Let us make it known to Allah that we have no mercy in our hearts for the idolators.\" Allah said,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ كَتَبَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ الإِيمَـنَ وَأَيَّدَهُمْ بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ\n(For such He has written faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Ruh from Himself.) means, those who have the quality of not befriending those who oppose Allah and His Messenger , even if they are their fathers or brothers, are those whom Allah has decreed faith, meaning, happiness, in their hearts and made faith dear to their hearts and happiness reside therein. As-Suddi said that the Ayah,\nكَتَبَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ الإِيمَـنَ\n(He has written faith in their hearts,) means, \"He has placed faith in their hearts.\" Ibn `Abbas said that,\nوَأَيَّدَهُمْ بِرُوحٍ مِّنْهُ\n(and strengthened them with Ruh from Himself.) means, \"He gave them strengths.\" Allah's statement,\nوَيُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَا رَضِىَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُواْ عَنْهُ\n(And He will admit them to Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein. Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him.) was explained several times before. Allah's statement,\nرِّضِىَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُواْ عَنْهُ\n(Allah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him.) contains a beautiful secret. When the believers became enraged against their relatives and kindred in Allah's cause, He compensated them by being pleased with them and making them pleased with Him from what He has granted them of eternal delight, ultimate victory and encompassing favor. Allah's statement,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ حِزْبُ اللَّهِ أَلاَ إِنَّ حِزْبَ اللَّهِ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ\n(They are the party of Allah. Verily, the party of Allah will be the successful.) indicates that they are the party of Allah, meaning, His servants who are worthy of earning His honor. Allah's statement,\nأَلاَ إِنَّ حِزْبَ اللَّهِ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ\n(Verily, the party of Allah will be the successful.) asserts their success, happiness and triumph in this life and the Hereafter, in contrast to those, who are the party of the devil,\nأَلاَ إِنَّ حِزْبَ الشَّيْطَـنِ هُمُ الخَـسِرُونَ\n(Verily, the party of Shaytan will be the losers!)

Allah said,\nكَتَبَ اللَّهُ لاّغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِى\n(Allah has decreed: \"Verily, I and My Messengers shall be the victorious.\") meaning, He has decreed, written in the First Book, and decided in the decree that He has willed -- which can never be resisted, changed or prevented -- that final victory is for Him, His Book, His Messengers and the faithful believers, in this life and the Hereafter:\nإِنَّ الْعَـقِبَةَ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ\n(Surely, the (good) end is for those who have Taqwa.)(11:49),\nإِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَيَوْمَ يَقُومُ الاٌّشْهَـدُ - يَوْمَ لاَ يَنفَعُ الظَّـلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ وَلَهُمُ الْلَّعْنَةُ وَلَهُمْ سُوءُ الدَّارِ\n(Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe in the life of this world and on the Day when the witnesses will stand forth, the Day when their excuses will be of no profit to the wrongdoers. Theirs will be the curse, and theirs will be the evil abode.)(40:51-52) Allah said here,\nكَتَبَ اللَّهُ لاّغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِى إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ\n(Allah has decreed: \"Verily, I and My Messengers shall be the victorious.\" Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, Almighty.) meaning, the Almighty, All-Powerful has decreed that He shall prevail over His enemies.

Meaning, do not befriend the deniers, even if they are among the closest relatives.
