I composed it this commentary in the same length of time appointed for the one spoken to by God sc. Moses and I have made it a means to attaining the Gardens of Bliss. It this commentary actually draws on the work which it complements relying and depending on it for an understanding of those allegorical verses. May God have mercy on one who examines it with impartiality chances upon an error and informs me of it. As I have said “I praise God my Lord for He guided me in what I have expressed despite my incapacity and weakness; for who other than God is there to avert me from error and who is there to accept from me even a single letter”."}]}
