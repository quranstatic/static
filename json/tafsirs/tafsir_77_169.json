He was reciting it and I was learning it from his mouth. Verily, his mouth was moist with it when a snake leaped out at us. The Prophet said,\n«اقْتُلُوهَا»\n(Kill it!) So we quickly went after it, but it got away. Then the Prophet said,\n«وُقِيَتْ شَرَّكُمْ، كَمَا وُقِيتُمْ شَرَّهَا»\n(It was saved from your harm just as you all were saved from its harm.)\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith by way of Al-A`mash. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas, who reported from his mother that she heard the Prophet reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat.) in the Maghrib prayer. In a report from Malik on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, he narrated that Umm Al-Fadl (his mother) heard him (Ibn `Abbas) reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) (77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He recited it in the Maghrib prayer (i.e., before he died).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this report in the Two Sahihs by way of Malik.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAllah's swearing by Different Creatures about the Occurrence of the Hereafter\nIbn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) \"The angels.\" From Masruq, Abu Ad-Duha, Mujahid in one narrations from him, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, statements similar to this have been reported. It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger ﷺ.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,\nوَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ\n(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ\n(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,\nفَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً\n(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil. All of this will occur, meaning it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.\nA Mention of some of what will occur on the Day of Judgement\nThen Allah says,\nفَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ\n(Then when the stars lose their lights.) meaning, their light will leave. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.) Mujahid said,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means postponed.\" Ath-Thawri narrated from Mansur, who narrated from Ibrahim that he said concerning the word,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means promised.\" It seems as though he holds this to be similar to Allah's statement,\nوَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord: and the Book will be produced; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.) (39:69) Then Allah says,\nلأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of Sorting Out. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!) Allah is saying, `for which day are the Messengers postponed and their matter expected, so that the Hour will be established' This is as Allah says,\nفَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ - يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution. On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.) Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future."},{"SurahNumber":77,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Revelation of this Surat and its Recitation in the Maghrib Prayer\nAl-Bukhari recorded from `Abdullah - that is Ibn Mas`ud -- that he said, \"While we were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in a cave at Mina,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ\n(By the Mursalat.) was revealed to him.

(39:69) Then Allah says,\nلأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of Sorting Out. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!) Allah is saying, `for which day are the Messengers postponed and their matter expected, so that the Hour will be established' This is as Allah says,\nفَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ - يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution. On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.) Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future."},{"SurahNumber":77,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Revelation of this Surat and its Recitation in the Maghrib Prayer\nAl-Bukhari recorded from `Abdullah - that is Ibn Mas`ud -- that he said, \"While we were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in a cave at Mina,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ\n(By the Mursalat.) was revealed to him. He was reciting it and I was learning it from his mouth. Verily, his mouth was moist with it when a snake leaped out at us. The Prophet said,\n«اقْتُلُوهَا»\n(Kill it!) So we quickly went after it, but it got away. Then the Prophet said,\n«وُقِيَتْ شَرَّكُمْ، كَمَا وُقِيتُمْ شَرَّهَا»\n(It was saved from your harm just as you all were saved from its harm.)\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith by way of Al-A`mash. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas, who reported from his mother that she heard the Prophet reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat.) in the Maghrib prayer. In a report from Malik on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, he narrated that Umm Al-Fadl (his mother) heard him (Ibn `Abbas) reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) (77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He recited it in the Maghrib prayer (i.e., before he died).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this report in the Two Sahihs by way of Malik.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAllah's swearing by Different Creatures about the Occurrence of the Hereafter\nIbn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) \"The angels.\" From Masruq, Abu Ad-Duha, Mujahid in one narrations from him, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, statements similar to this have been reported. It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger ﷺ.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,\nوَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ\n(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ\n(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,\nفَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً\n(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil.

This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.)

(82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.) Mujahid said,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means postponed.\" Ath-Thawri narrated from Mansur, who narrated from Ibrahim that he said concerning the word,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means promised.\" It seems as though he holds this to be similar to Allah's statement,\nوَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord: and the Book will be produced; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.)

(14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.)

Then the Prophet said,\n«وُقِيَتْ شَرَّكُمْ، كَمَا وُقِيتُمْ شَرَّهَا»\n(It was saved from your harm just as you all were saved from its harm.)\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith by way of Al-A`mash. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas, who reported from his mother that she heard the Prophet reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat.) in the Maghrib prayer. In a report from Malik on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, he narrated that Umm Al-Fadl (his mother) heard him (Ibn `Abbas) reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) (77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.

It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger ﷺ.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,\nوَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ\n(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ\n(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).)

This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil.

Allah then says,\nفَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً\n(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil.

This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.)

(14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.)

Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,\nوَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ\n(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ\n(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,\nفَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً\n(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil. All of this will occur, meaning it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.\nA Mention of some of what will occur on the Day of Judgement\nThen Allah says,\nفَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ\n(Then when the stars lose their lights.) meaning, their light will leave. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.) Mujahid said,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means postponed.\" Ath-Thawri narrated from Mansur, who narrated from Ibrahim that he said concerning the word,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means promised.\" It seems as though he holds this to be similar to Allah's statement,\nوَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord: and the Book will be produced; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.) (39:69) Then Allah says,\nلأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of Sorting Out. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!)

Certainly, Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution. On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.) Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future."},{"SurahNumber":77,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Revelation of this Surat and its Recitation in the Maghrib Prayer\nAl-Bukhari recorded from `Abdullah - that is Ibn Mas`ud -- that he said, \"While we were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in a cave at Mina,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ\n(By the Mursalat.) was revealed to him.

Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future."},{"SurahNumber":77,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Revelation of this Surat and its Recitation in the Maghrib Prayer\nAl-Bukhari recorded from `Abdullah - that is Ibn Mas`ud -- that he said, \"While we were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in a cave at Mina,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ\n(By the Mursalat.) was revealed to him. He was reciting it and I was learning it from his mouth. Verily, his mouth was moist with it when a snake leaped out at us. The Prophet said,\n«اقْتُلُوهَا»\n(Kill it!) So we quickly went after it, but it got away. Then the Prophet said,\n«وُقِيَتْ شَرَّكُمْ، كَمَا وُقِيتُمْ شَرَّهَا»\n(It was saved from your harm just as you all were saved from its harm.)\" Muslim also recorded this Hadith by way of Al-A`mash. Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas, who reported from his mother that she heard the Prophet reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat.) in the Maghrib prayer. In a report from Malik on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, he narrated that Umm Al-Fadl (his mother) heard him (Ibn `Abbas) reciting\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) (77:1) so she said, \"O my son! You reminded me with your recitation of this Surat. Verily, it is the last thing I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He recited it in the Maghrib prayer (i.e., before he died).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this report in the Two Sahihs by way of Malik.\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAllah's swearing by Different Creatures about the Occurrence of the Hereafter\nIbn Abi Hatim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,\nوَالْمُرْسَلَـتِ عُرْفاً\n(By the Mursalat `Urfa.) \"The angels.\" From Masruq, Abu Ad-Duha, Mujahid in one narrations from him, As-Suddi and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, statements similar to this have been reported. It has been reported from Abu Salih that he said, \"These are the Messenger ﷺ.\" In another narration from him (Abu Salih) he said that it means the angels. Abu Salih has also said the meaning of Al-`Asifat, An-Nashirat, Al-Fariqat and Al-Mulqiyat, that they all refer to the angels. Ath-Thawri narrated from Salamah bin Kuhayl, who reported from Muslim Al-Batin, who reported from Abu Al-`Ubaydayn that he asked Ibn Mas`ud about the meaning of Al-Mursalat `Urfa, and he (Ibn Mas`ud) said, \"The wind.\" He said the same about Al-`Asifat `Asfa and An-Nashirat Nashra, that they all refer to the wind. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah all said the same. Ibn Jarir confidently affirmed that Al-`Asifat `Asfa means the wind just as Ibn Mas`ud and those who followed him said.However, he (Ibn Jarir) did not affirm whether An-Nashirat Nashra are the angels or the wind as has preceded. It has been reported from Abu Salih that An-Nashirat Nashra is the rain. The most obvious meaning is as Allah says,\nوَأَرْسَلْنَا الرِّيَاحَ لَوَاقِحَ\n(And we send the winds fertilizing.) (15:22) He also says,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ بُشْرىً بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ\n(And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain).) (7:57) Similarly, Al-`Asifat are winds. It is said (in Arabic) that the winds `Asifat when they make noise with their blowing. Likewise, An-Nashirat are the winds that scatter into clouds in the horizons of the sky according to the will of the Lord. Allah then says,\nفَالْفَـرِقَـتِ فَرْقاً - فَالْمُلْقِيَـتِ ذِكْراً - عُذْراً أَوْ نُذْراً\n(The Fariqat that separate, the Mulqiyat that remind, excusing or warning.) meaning, the angels. This was said by Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Masruq, Mujahid, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri. There is no difference of opinion here, because they (the angels) are the ones who descend with Allah's command to the Messengers, separating between the truth and falsehood, guidance and misguidance, and the lawful and the forbidden. They bring the revelation to the Messengers, which contains exemption or absolvement for the creatures and a warning for them of Allah's torment if they oppose His command. Allah said,\nإِنَّمَا تُوعَدُونَ لَوَقِعٌ\n(Surely, what you are promised will occur.) This is the subject of these oaths. This means, what you all have been promised concerning the establishment of the Hour (Judgement Day), the blowing of the horn, the resurrection of the bodies, the gathering of those of old and those of latter times on one common ground and the rewarding of every doer of a deed based upon his deed. If he did good, then his reward will be good, and if he did evil, then his reward will be evil. All of this will occur, meaning it will come to pass and there is no avoiding it.\nA Mention of some of what will occur on the Day of Judgement\nThen Allah says,\nفَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ\n(Then when the stars lose their lights.) meaning, their light will leave. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ\n(And when the star fall.) (81:2) It is also similar to His statement,\nوَإِذَا الْكَوَاكِبُ انتَثَرَتْ\n(And when the stars have fallen and scattered.) (82:2) Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ فُرِجَتْ\n(And when Furijat the heaven.) meaning, it is cleft asunder, becomes split, its sides fall and its edges become weak.\nوَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ\n(And when the mountains are blown away.) meaning, they will be removed and no sight or trace of them will remain. This is as Allah says,\nوَيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الْجِبَالِ فَقُلْ يَنسِفُهَا رَبِّى نَسْفاً\n(And they ask you concerning the mountains: Say, \"My Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles of dust.\") (20:105) Allah also says,\n\" وَيَوْمَ نُسَيِّرُ الْجِبَالَ وَتَرَى الاٌّرْضَ بَارِزَةً وَحَشَرْنَـهُمْ فَلَمْ نُغَادِرْ مِنْهُمْ أَحَداً\n(And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a leveled plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them behind.) (18:47) Then He says,\nوَإِذَا الرُّسُلُ أُقِّتَتْ\n(And when the Messengers are Uqqitat.) Al-`Awfi narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said that Uqqitat means \"Gathered.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement,\nيَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ\n(On the Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together.) Mujahid said,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means postponed.\" Ath-Thawri narrated from Mansur, who narrated from Ibrahim that he said concerning the word,\nأُقِّتَتْ\n(Uqqitat.) \"This means promised.\" It seems as though he holds this to be similar to Allah's statement,\nوَأَشْرَقَتِ الاٌّرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا وَوُضِعَ الْكِتَـبُ وَجِـىءَ بِالنَّبِيِّيْنَ وَالشُّهَدَآءِ وَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُم بِالْحَقِّ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord: and the Book will be produced; and the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought forward; and it will be judged between them with truth, and they will not be wronged.) (39:69) Then Allah says,\nلأَيِّ يَوْمٍ أُجِّلَتْ - لِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ - وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(For what Day are these signs postponed For the Day of Sorting Out. And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers!) Allah is saying, `for which day are the Messengers postponed and their matter expected, so that the Hour will be established' This is as Allah says,\nفَلاَ تَحْسَبَنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْلِفَ وَعْدِهِ رُسُلَهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ ذُو انتِقَامٍ - يَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n(So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is Almighty, All-Able of Retribution. On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.) (14:47, 48) This is the Day of Sorting Out, as Allah says,\nلِيَوْمِ الْفَصْلِ\n(the Day of Sorting Out.) Then Allah says, in magnifying its matter,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ - وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(And what will explain to you what is the Day of Sorting Out Woe that Day to the deniers.) meaning, woe unto them from Allah's torment that is coming in the future."},{"SurahNumber":77,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"The Call to contemplate the various Manifestations of Allah's Power\nAllah says,\nأَلَمْ نُهْلِكِ الاٌّوَّلِينَ\n(Did We not destroy the ancients) meaning, those who rejected the Messengers and opposed what they came to them with.\nثُمَّ نُتْبِعُهُمُ الاٌّخِرِينَ\n(So shall We make later generations to follow them.) meaning, from those who are similar to them.

This is similar to what has been reported in the Hadith of Busr bin Jahhash (that Allah says),\n«ابْنَ آدَمَ أَنْى تُعْجِزُنِي وَقَدْ خَلَقْتُكَ مِنْ مِثْلِ هَذِهِ؟»\n(\"(O) Son of Adam !

Allah says, s\nكُلُواْ وَتَمَتَّعُواْ قَلِيلاً\n(Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little while.) meaning, for a period of time that is short, small and brief.\nإِنَّكُمْ مُّجْرِمُونَ\n(Verily, you are criminals.) meaning, then you all will be driven to the fire of Hell which has already been mentioned.\nوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(Woe that Day to the deniers!) This is similar to Allah's statement,\nنُمَتِّعُهُمْ قَلِيلاً ثُمَّ نَضْطَرُّهُمْ إِلَى عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ\n(We let them enjoy for a little while, then in the end We shall oblige them to a great torment.) (31:24) Allah also says,\nقُلْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ لاَ يُفْلِحُونَ - مَتَـعٌ فِى الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ الْعَذَابَ الشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ\n(Verily, those who invent a lie against Allah, will never be successsful. (A brief) enjoyment in this world! And then unto Us will be their return, then We shall make them taste the severest torment because they used to disbelieve.) (10:69,70) Then Allah says,\nوَإذَا قِيلَ لَهُمُ ارْكَعُواْ لاَ يَرْكَعُونَ\n(And when it is said to them: \"Bow down yourself!\" They bow not down.) meaning, when these ignorant disbelievers are ordered to pray with the congregation (of believers), they refuse and turn away from it arrogantly. Thus, Allah says,\nوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(Woe that Day to the deniers!) Then Allah says,\nفَبِأَىِّ حَدِيثٍ بَعْدَهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(Then in what statement after this will they believe) meaning, if they do not believe in this Qur'an, then what talk will they believe in This is as Allah says,\nفَبِأَىِّ حَدِيثٍ بَعْدَ اللَّهِ وَءايَـتِهِ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(Then in which speech after Allah and His Ayat will they believe) (45: 6) This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Mursalat, and all praise and thanks are due to Allah. He is the Giver of success and security."}]}
