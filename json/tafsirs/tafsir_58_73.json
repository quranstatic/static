(And Allah heareth your colloquy) and Allah hears your conversation and exchange of words. (Lo! Allah is Hearer) of your conversation, (Knower) of her matter. The story is that Khawlah Bint Tha'labah Ibn Malik Ibn al-Dakhshim al-Ansariyyah was married to Aws Ibn al-Samit al-Ansari and the latter, who was touched by the jinn, wanted to have sexual intercourse with her while in her period. When she refused, he became angry and said: if you leave the house before I have sexual intercourse with you, you are unlawful to me just as my mother is."},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"(Such of you as put away your wives (by saying they are as their mothers)-They are not their mothers) they are not like their mothers; (none are their mothers) in terms of unmarriageability (except those who gave them birth) or those whose milk they drank in their infancy (they indeed utter an ill word) when they declare their wives unlawful to them, like the unlawfulness of their mothers (and a lie. And lo! Allah is Forgiving) since He did not punish him for declaring unlawful that which Allah made lawful, (Merciful) after he has repented and shown remorse."},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Allah explained the expiation for saying to one's wife: you are unlawful to me just like my mother is (Zihar), saying: (Those who put away their wives (by saying they are as their mothers)) those who make unlawful for themselves sexual intercourse with their wives (and afterward would go back on that which they have said) then go back on making it lawful; ((the penalty) in that case (is) the freeing of a slave before they touch one another. Unto this) freeing of a slave (ye are exhorted) as an expiation of the Zihar; (and Allah is informed of what ye do) regarding the Zihar, of expiation and other things."},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"(And he who findeth not (the wherewithal)) the means to free a slave, (let him fast for two successive months before they touch one another) before they have sexual intercourse with one another; (and for him who is unable to do so) i.e. to fast because he is weak ((the penance is) the feeding of sixty needy ones) giving each needy person half a measure (half a sa') of wheat or one measure (sa') of barley or dates. (This) which I have explained regarding the expiation of the Zihar, (that ye may put trust in Allah and His messenger) in order that you acknowledge the obligations of Allah and the wont of His Messenger. (Such are the limits (imposed by Allah)) such are the legal rulings and obligations of Allah regarding the Zihar; (and for disbelievers) in the limits imposed by Allah (is a painful doom) whose pain will extend to their hearts. From the beginning of the surah to this point was revealed about Khawlah Bint Tha'labah Ibn Malik al-Ansariyyah and her husband Aws Ibn al-Samit, the brother of 'Ubadah Ibn al-Samit, who was angered by his wife for refusing him to sleep with her and, as a result, made sexual intercourse with her forbidden on him. But he regretted doing so, and Allah revealed how he could expiate the sin he committed. The Prophet (pbuh) told him: You should free a slave. Aws said: I have very little money and it costs a great deal to free a slave. The Prophet (pbuh) said: Then you should fast two successive months. Aws said: I cannot do so! If I do not eat once or twice a day my eyesight becomes dim; and I fear peril if I fast. The Prophet (pbuh) said: Then you should feed 60 needy ones. Aws said: I can not afford it. The Prophet (pbuh) ordered for him a measure of dates and commanded him to give it to the needy. Aws said: I do not know of anyone in Medina who is more in need of it than I. The Prophet (pbuh) told him to eat it and, with the help of another person, the Prophet (pbuh) fed 60 needy people, and this allowed Aws to go back to his wife whom he had declared unlawful for himself."},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"(Those who oppose Allah and His messenger) regarding Religion and show enmity towards him (will be abased) they will be chastised and conquered on the day of the Ditch; they will be killed and defeated; the reference here is to the people of Mecca (even those before them were abased) just as those who had fought against the prophets before the people of Mecca were chastised and conquered; (and We have sent down clear tokens) We have sent Gabriel with revelations making clear the commands and prohibitions, the lawful and unlawful, (and for disbelievers) in the revelations of Allah (is a shameful doom) through which they will be humiliated; and it is said that a shameful doom means: a severe chastisement."},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"(On the day when Allah will raise them all together) will raise the adherents of all religions (and inform them of what they did) in the life of the world. (Allah hath kept account of it) i.e. He has kept account of all their works (while they forgot it) while they left the obedience of Allah with which they were commanded.

(Lo! Allah is Knower of all things) of their works and secret conference. This verse was revealed about Safwan Ibn Umayyah and his son-in-law; their story is mentioned in the Surah of Prostration."},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"(Hast thou not observed) O Muhammad (those who were forbidden conspiracy) other than true believers (and afterward returned to that which they had been forbidden) of conspiracy, leaving aside true believers, (and (now) conspire together) among themselves (for crime) for lies (and wrong-doing) transgression (and disobedience towards the messenger) by opposing the Messenger after he forbade them from doing so? What happened is that the hypocrites used to hold secret conferences with the Jews regarding the military expeditions of the believers, in order to aggrieve the believers. (And when they) i.e. the Jews (come unto thee they greet thee with a greeting wherewith Allah greeteth thee not) for they used to say al-sam, i.e. death, be with you [that is instead of saying al-salam, i.e. peace, be with you] and the Prophet (pbuh) used to answer: and al-sam be with you, (and say within themselves) to one another: (Why should Allah punish us for what we say) to His Prophet? If he were truly a Prophet, as he claims, his prayer would have been answered when he answers: and al-sam be with you. Allah answered them, saying: (Hell will suffice them) i.e. the Jews as a destination in the Hereafter; (they will feel the heat thereof. A hapless journey's end) is hell wherein they will end!"},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"(O ye who believe) in Muhammad (pbuh) and the Qur'an!

(In Allah let believers put their trust) and let them not put it in other than Him."},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"(O ye who believe! When it is said) when the Prophet (pbuh) says: (Make room in assemblies, then make room; Allah will make way for you (Hereafter)) in the Hereafter. This was revealed about Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas whose story is mentioned in the Surah of the Private Apartments. It is also said it was revealed about a group of people from Badr, among whom were Thabit Ibn Qays Ibn Shammas. These people went to the Prophet (pbuh) on a Friday when he was staying in the apartment of his wife Safiyyah. When they could not find a place where to sit, they stood at the beginning of the assembly. So the Prophet (pbuh) addressed some people who were not among those who participated in the Battle of Badr: so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so let those who took part in the Battle of Badr sit in your places. This is because the Prophet (pbuh) used to honour all those who fought at the battle of Badr. But when he did that, he noticed that those who were made to give up their seats resented it, and so Allah revealed about them this verse. (And when it is said, Come up higher!) in prayer, jihad or remembrance (go up higher; Allah will exalt those who believe) in secret and openly (among you) in ranks, (and those who have knowledge) along with faith, (to high ranks) merits in Paradise, more than the merits given to those who have faith but have no knowledge. This is because a believer who is knowledgeable is better than a believer who is not.

(When ye hold conference) when you speak (with the messenger, offer an alms before your conference). This was revealed about those believers who were well off and used to speak to the Prophet (pbuh) more than the poor believers, so much so that they vexed both the Prophet (pbuh) and the poor believers. Allah, therefore, forbade them from doing so and commanded them to give alms to the poor, one silver coin for each word they would say to him, before they even spoke with the Prophet (pbuh). (That) almsgiving (is better) than holding back money (and purer for you) and purer for your hearts from sins; and it is also said this means: it is purer for the hearts of the poor in that it prevents their hearts from becoming hard. (But if ye cannot find (the wherewithal)) to give alms, O poor believers, then you can speak with the Prophet (pbuh) as much as you wish without being required to give alms (then lo! Allah is Forgiving) He forgives your sins, (Merciful) towards the one among you who dies repentant."},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"When they stopped speaking with the Prophet (pbuh) because of the required almsgiving involved, Allah reproached them for doing so, saying: (Fear ye) are you miserly, O well off people, (to offer alms before your conference) to offer alms to the poor before speaking with the Prophet (pbuh)? (Then, when ye do it not) when you do not give alms (and Allah hath forgiven you) the question of giving alms, (establish worship) perform the five daily prayers (and pay the poor-due) from your wealth (and obey Allah) in that which He commands you (and His messenger) in that which he commands you. (And Allah is Aware of what ye do) whether it is good or evil. But no one gave alms for speaking with the Prophet (pbuh) except 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib who gave to alms a golden piece which he sold for ten silver pieces, and then asked the Prophet (pbuh) a question of ten words."},{"SurahNumber":58,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"Allah then said about 'Abdullah Ibn Ubayy and his host, because of their alliance with the Jews: (Hast thou not seen) O Muhammad (those who take for friends) for assistance and help (a folk) i.e. the Jews (with whom Allah is wroth?
