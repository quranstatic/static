There is another way of understanding the above: those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture, before the advent Muhammad (pbuh) such as 'Abdullah Ibn Salam and his followers, and those who ascribed partners to Allah before the advent of Muhammad (pbuh) such as Abu Bakr and his fellow Arabs, would not have desisted from their disbelief and idolatry until the clear proof came to them, i.e. until Muhammad (pbuh) came to them."},{"SurahNumber":98,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"(A messenger from Allah) i.e. Muhammad (pbuh) (reading) to them (purified pages) pages purified from idolatry"},{"SurahNumber":98,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"(Containing) i.e. the page of Muhammad (pbuh) contains (correct scriptures) a religion and a straight and just way that contains no crookedness."},{"SurahNumber":98,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"(Nor were the People of the Scripture divided) those who were given the Torah, i.e. Ka'b Ibn al-Ashraf and his host, did not differ about Muhammad (pbuh) the Qur'an and Islam (until after the clear proof came unto them) until the clarification of what is in their Scripture regarding the traits and description of Muhammad (pbuh) came to them."},{"SurahNumber":98,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"(And they are ordered) in all the Scriptures (naught else than to serve Allah) nothing else but to profess Allah's divine Oneness, (keeping religion pure for Him) through the profession of Allah's divine Oneness, (as men by nature upright) as ones surrendered unto Him, (and to establish worship) and perform the five daily prayers after declaring their profession in Allah's divine Oneness (and to pay the poor-due) from their wealth after that.
