There was a peace treaty between them and the Prophet Muhammad. But they committed breaches of this treaty time and again. At last in the fourth year of Hijrah, Almighty God created such conditions that they were compelled to leave Madinah. Thereafter, they settled in Khybar and Azra’at. But their conspiratorial activities  continued. During the caliphate of ‘Umar Faruq, they and some other Jewish tribes were made to leave the Arabian Peninsula.

Sometimes the enemy retreats without fighting. On such occasions the booty acquired is described as abandoned property (fay’). As for the spoils of war, after a fifth part has been taken out, all of the remaining portion is  the share of the army. While all the abandoned property in the case of Fay belongs to the Islamic government and is to be spent in the public interest. It is the intention of Islam that wealth should not remain restricted to a particular class but should reach every class. In Islam, there is no concept of economy controlled by the State. However, its economic rules are so framed that wealth should not be concentrated,  but should keep circulating in all groups."},{"SurahNumber":59,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"When the enemy have fled after defeat, their possessions are considered spoils of war (ghanimah).

But the helpers open-heartedly welcomed the migrants (muhajirun). Wherever the Prophet of God received any bounty, he shared it out among the migrants. In spite of that the Muslims of Madinah did not bear the migrants any ill-will. Ultimately, they fully acknowledged the migrants’ services to Islam and used to pray for them from the bottom of their hearts. It is such broad-mindedness which will assure a group an honoured place in the annals of history."},{"SurahNumber":59,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"After the hijrah, the Muslims who left their native place and migrated to Madinah were in reality a burden on the inhabitants of Madinah, who were known as ‘helpers’ (ansar).

They asked the Banu al-Nadir to take a firm stand and assured them of their support. But the hypocrites uttered these words just to incite them to rise against Muslims; they were never sincere in their offer. So, when the Muslims besieged the Banu al-Nadir, nobody came to help them.

But the power of human beings is plainly visible. For this reason, those who are concerned only with appearances are fearless of God, but if they come across a human being who is stronger than the others, they feel afraid of him. Their lack of awareness with regard to God creates in them a lack of consciousness of the world also. Those who become united for some negative purpose cannot remain united for long, because, for the purpose of long-lasting unity, a positive basis is required and that is precisely what they do not have."},{"SurahNumber":59,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"God’s power is not outwardly visible.

The present world is a man’s ‘today’ and the world of the Hereafter is man’s ‘tomorrow’. Whatever a man does in the present world, he has to face the basic consequences in the ensuing longer life. This is the truth and the other name for it is Islam. Man’s success depends upon his always keeping this reality in mind. The whole life of one who is forgetful of this, will go wrong. In this matter, there is no difference between a believer or a non-believer. Believers will have the advantage only if they acknowledge realities. If they become forgetful of them, they will also meet the same fate as their  precursors."},{"SurahNumber":59,"VerseNumber":19,"Text":"Human life is divided into two parts: ‘today’ and ‘tomorrow’.

This fact is of such grave import that it is enough to make even mountains tremble. But man is so negligent, forgetful and insensitive that, even after knowing this awesome fact, he is not perturbed. The names of God mentioned here are, on the one hand, an introduction to God’s Being. On the other hand, they show how Great is that Being who is the Creator of human beings and who keeps a constant watch over them. If an individual actually realises this, he will be completely engrossed in the remembrance and praises of God. The universe, by virtue of its creative meaningfulness, mirrors the attributes of God. It is itself wholly taken up with singing the praises of God and urges human beings to follow suit."},{"SurahNumber":59,"VerseNumber":22,"Text":"The Quran is a declaration of the vital fact that man is not free, but is answerable for all his deeds to God who is all-powerful and who keeps a close watch on the actions of all mankind.
