Sayyidna Sa'd Ibn Abi Waqqas has narrated that the Holy Prophet ﷺ once said.\nان خیر الذکر الخفی ، وخیر الرزق ما یکفی\n\"Surely the best way to make supplication to Allah is in\nundertone and the best sustenance is that which is sufficient for one's needs (i.e. neither more nor less than required) \" (Qurtubi)"},{"SurahNumber":19,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"إِنِّي وَهَنَ الْعَظْمُ مِنِّي وَاشْتَعَلَ الرَّ‌أْسُ شَيْبًا\n\"Here I am that bones within me have turned feeble, and the head has flared up grey with old age.\" - 19:4\nHuman body becomes weak with the aging of bones, because it is the bones which keep the body firm and upright. When bones lose their strength, the whole body turns weak.\nThe literal meaning of اشْتَعَالَ is a sudden burst of fire. Here the word is used as a simile for grey hair covering the head like a glow of fire.\nMention of one's needs in supplication is desirable\nHere Sayyidna Zakariyya (علیہ السلام) before making his supplication, mentioned about his weakness and old age by referring to his bones. One of the reasons for this was, as pointed out in the translation, that in his peculiar circumstances i.e. his old age and physical weakness, it was not appropriate for him to ask for a child. Another reason given by Imam Qurtubi in his commentary is, that for possible acceptance of supplication it is better to mention one's weakness, destitution and inadequacy. For this reason religious scholars have emphasized that one should recount Allah Ta` ala's blessings and his own exigency before making his supplication."},{"SurahNumber":19,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"مَوَالِيَ is the plural of مَولٰی .

Hence, the question as to who would inherit the same, does not arise. Secondly, it is inconsistent with the exalted position of a prophet to concern himself with such matters. And thirdly, a saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ ، which has been unanimously accepted by all religious scholars, says:\nان العلماء ورثۃ الأنبیاء لم یورثوا دینارا ولا درھما انما ورثوا العلم، فمن اخذہ اخذ بحظ وافر۔ (رواہ احمد و أبو داؤد وابن ماجۃ والترمذی)\n\"Indeed the knowledgeable scholars are the inheritors of the prophets, because the prophets do not leave any material wealth. Their legacy is knowledge. One who has acquired knowledge has received great fortune.\"\nThe above saying of the Prophet ﷺ is also recorded in Al-Kafi, by Al-Kulaini, the well-known book of the Shiite school. It is narrated in Sahih Al-Bukhari through Sayyidah ` A'ishah ؓ that the Holy Prophet ﷺ said:\nلا نورث، ما ترکنا صدقۃ\n\"No one inherits our (i.e. prophets' ) wealth, because whatever wealth we leave behind is Sadaqah (Charity) (صدقۃ).\"\nIn the verse itself after يَرِ‌ثُنِي the addition of the words يَرِ‌ثُ مِنْ آلِ يَعْقُوبَ (19:6) confirms the view that here the material inheritance is not implied, because the son, Yahya\tعلیہ السلام ، could not have inherited the material wealth of the family of Sayyidna Ya` qub (علیہ السلام) ، which could only be inherited by their near relations and not by Sayyidna Yahya (علیہ السلام) . It is against the law of inheritance for distant relations to receive any part of inheritance in the presence of close relatives.\nRuh ul-Ma` ani quotes the following from Al-Kafi, by Al-Kulaini, the well-known Shi'ah scholar:\nعن ابی البختری عن ابی عبداللہ قال : إن سلیمان ورث داؤد وإن محمَّدا ﷺ ورث سلیمان\nSulayman Ali was the heir of Dawud (علیہ السلام) and Muhammad ﷺ was the heir of Sulayman\nIt is quite obvious that the Holy Prophet ﷺ did not inherit any material wealth from Sulayman (علیہ السلام) ، nor did Sulayman (علیہ السلام) receive any such inheritance from Dawud (علیہ السلام) .

This fact also suggests that he possessed certain special attributes which were not granted to anyone else before him. And if we take the second meaning of the word سَمِی then it will mean that some of his attributes and situations were such that they were peculiar to him and were not shared by any other prophet, and that he was unique in the possession of those special attributes, for instance his self abnegation and denial of worldly comforts (حصُور). However, it does not necessarily follow that he was superior to all the prophets who preceded him, for the superiority of Sayyidna Ibrahim Khalilullah (علیہ السلام) and Sayyidna Musa Kalimullah (علیہ السلام) over him is established and well known.

The purpose of her shifting to a secluded corner of the house has been differently explained. Some say she had moved there to take a bath, while others say that she had moved as usual to a secluded corner on the eastern side of her place of worship for offering her prayers.

Allah Ta` ala had placed before Sayyidah Maryam (علیہا السلام) the likeness of the son to be born to her. But the former version is more appropriate and is confirmed by the statement that follows.\nفَتَمَثَّلَ لَھَا بَشَراً سَوِیَّا\n\"He took before her the form of a perfect human.\" - 19:17.\nIt is not given to a human being to see an angel in its real form, because he will be overwhelmed by fright at such an experience. This, indeed is, that happened to The Holy Prophet ﷺ in the cave of Hira' on his first encounter with Sayyidna Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) and again later on.\nSayyidna Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) appeared before Sayyidah Maryam (علیہا السلام) in the form of a man, so as not to frighten her. When Sayyidah Maryam (علیہا السلام) saw a man near her she became apprehensive of his intentions and said"},{"SurahNumber":19,"VerseNumber":18,"Text":"إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِالرَّ‌حْمَـٰنِ مِنكَ seek refuge of the Rahman (All-Merciful), against you.\" (19:18) Some reports have it that when Sayyidna Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) heard these words he retreated a little in reverence of Allah's name.\nإِن كُنتَ تَقِيًّا\n\"If you are God-fearing.\" - 19:18.\nThese are the words which a helpless person would utter to a cruel oppressor begging him that if he is a believer then he should desist from tormenting him. The intention is that Sayyidah Maryam (علیہا السلام) entreated Sayyidna Jibra'il (علیہ السلام) who stood before her in the guise of a man, that he should fear Allah and abstain from evil deeds. In short, the expressionإِن كُنتَ تَقِيًّا (if you are God-fearing - 19:18) is not a precondition for seeking the protection of Allah but a condition to make her prayer more effective and inducing. Some other commentators have said that this expression is used for emphasis, meaning that even if you fear Allah I seek His protection; and if the position is otherwise then I shall seek Allah's refuge with added vehemence.

This could be tantamount to committing a sin of showing impatience and only death could save her from such a predicament.\nThe vow of silence has been prohibited under the Islamic Law\nBefore the advent of Islam silence was also a form of worship, and those who observed this fast were not supposed to speak from dawn to dusk. Islam cancelled this fast and made it mandatory to refrain from idle talk, lying and back-biting. Refraining from normal conversation is not a form of worship in Islam anymore and, hence to take a vow of silence is also not permissible. Abu Dawud (رح) has reported the following Hadith from the Holy Prophet ﷺ .\nلا یتم بعد احتلام ، ولا صمات یوم الی اللیل\nIt means that a child who has lost his father may not be regarded as an orphan after attaining puberty, and the rules pertaining to an orphan cease to apply on him. And that remaining silent from dawn to dusk is not a form of worship in Islam (This Hadith has been rated by As-Suyuti and Al-` Azizi as Hasan).\nShe has been directed to eat the dates because it has been established medically that the use of water and dates gives relief in labour pains.\nConceiving a child without copulation with a man is not totally impossible\nThat Sayyidah Maryam (علیہا السلام) conceived and gave birth to a child was a miracle. And miracles, however improbable they may be in appearance, are not beyond Allah's power, rather, the more improbable they are, the more pronounced their miraculous nature. However, it cannot be taken as totally impossible, because according to some books of medical science, the lubricants found inside the female genitals are not merely a passive agent for conceiving a child; they also have a capacity of being active and a potential to make fetus by themselves without an external semen joining them. Ibn Sina (Avicenna), the famous medical scientist, has mentioned in his book 'Al-Qanun' that in a special disease, named by him as 'Raja' an imperfect form of even the organs of a fetus is shaped in the uterus of a woman without the intermediation of a male semen. So long as this potential is there, it cannot be taken as totally impossible, because some abnormal factor may increase this potential.\nIn verse 25 Allah Ta` ala commanded Sayyidah Maryam (علیہا السلام) to shake the date tree, although it was within His power to drop the dates in her lap.

It is obvious, therefore, that in verse 28 where Sayyidah Maryam (علیہا السلام) is addressed as the sister of Sayyidna Harun (علیہ السلام) cannot be in its literal sense. This is also corroborated by the incident that when The Holy Prophet ﷺ sent Sayyidna Mughirah Ibn Shu'bah ؓ as his ambassador to the people of Najran they questioned him that in the Qur’ an Sayyidah Maryam (علیہا السلام) has been referred to as the sister of Sayyidna Harun (علیہ السلام) whereas he had died long before her. Sayyidna Mughirah ؓ did not know the answer to this question. So, when he returned from the mission, he narrated the whole incident to The Holy Prophet ﷺ . On this The Holy Prophet ﷺ said why did you not tell them that it has been a common practice with the believers to adopt the names of the prophets in expectation of receiving their Barakah (blessings), and to claim relationship with them. (Ahmad, Muslim, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i)\nThis saying of the Prophet ﷺ may be interpreted in two ways.

When he heard their accusations he stopped sucking milk and moved over to his left side facing them, and raising his index finger he said:إِنِّي عَبْدُ اللَّـهِ i.e. I am the servant of Allah. In this way in his very first words Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) made it clear that although his birth was a miracle, he himself was not God, but only a servant of God. This was to eliminate forever the possibility of people worshipping him as God due to his miraculous birth.\nآتَانِيَ الْكِتَابَ وَجَعَلَنِي نَبِيًّا\n\"He has given me the Book and made me a prophet.\" - 19:30.\nIn these words, Sayyidna ` Isa\tI even in his infancy announced his future prophethood and the revelation to him of a sacred book from Allah Ta` ala. Since no prophet has been granted prophethood and a sacred book before the age of forty years, therefore this pre-announcement of his prophethood by Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہا السلام) here means to convey in advance that he would be bestowed prophethood and the Book at the proper time. In a similar manner The Holy Prophet ﷺ said that he was bestowed prophethood even before Adam (علیہ السلام) was yet in the process of his creation. This shows that the promise for granting prophethood to Sayyidna Muhammad Al-Mustafa ﷺ was firm and final. Here too, because of the certainty of occurrence, the grant of prophethood is referred to in the past tense. By announcing his future prophethood he (Sayyidna ` Isa علیہ السلام) dispelled peoples' doubts and exonerated his mother from the charge of fornication, because his being a Prophet was proof enough that his birth was free from any blemish."},{"SurahNumber":19,"VerseNumber":31,"Text":"وَأَوْصَانِي بِالصَّلَاةِ وَالزَّكَاةِ\n\"And has enjoined Sa1ah and Zakah upon me.\" - 19:31.\nThe word أَوْصَانِي is derived from the word وَصِیِّۃ (Wasiyyah) which normally means 'to bequeath', but when used in the context of issuing an order, it implies an emphatic command, and here it is used to put emphasis on a command of Allah. For this reason it is translated in the text as 'enjoined'. Here Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) has said that Allah Ta’ ala had commanded him to offer Prayers and give the obligatory charity (Zakah), the intention being that he was commanded to observe both these duties with great diligence. Prayers and Zakah are two forms of worship which have been enjoined as obligatory in the Shar` iah (Laws) of all the prophets from Adam (علیہ السلام) to the last of the Prophets, Muhammad ﷺ . However, their details vary in different codes. In the Shar` iah of Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) prayers and Zakah were also made compulsory. It is true that ` Isa (علیہ السلام) was never wealthy; neither did he build a house for himself nor did he accumulate any material riches, then why was he enjoined to pay Zakah? The answer is that this injunction is of general application in that whosoever possesses a certain level of wealth (نصاب) is liable to pay Zakah. This injunction applied to ` Isa I as well i.e. whenever he acquired wealth upto the level of Nisab (نَصاب) he was required to pay Zakah, but if his wealth remains below Nisab throughout his life, he would never be liable to pay Zakah. This situation, therefore, is not in conflict with the general rules governing Zakah.\nمَا دُمْتُ حَيًّا\n\"As long as I am alive.\" - 19:31.\nIt means that the injunction of prayers and Zakah is forever i.e. as long as I live.

However, in some readings the letter 'Lam' in 'Qawl' is rendered with Dammah i.e. قَوْلُ الْحَقِّ. In this case the sentence will mean that Sayyidna 'Isa (علیہا السلام) himself was a word of truth.

Some say it is applied to one who has never told a lie in his life. Others describe Siddiq (صِدِّيقً ) as one who is truthful in his beliefs, words and deeds. In other words his utterances truly reflect his beliefs, and his actions in turn match with his beliefs and words. Ruh ul-Ma` ani and Mazhari have adopted the latter meaning of the word. Then there are different degrees of صِدِّیقِیَت (Truthfulness) i.e. those who fall within this definition are placed at different pedestals. Only a prophet (نَبِی یَا رَسُول ) can be a true صِدِّيقً. While every prophet is gifted with this attribute, not everyone who has it is a prophet. A believer who follows in the footsteps of his prophet and attains this exalted position of صِدِّيقً (truthfulness) can also be called Siddiq.

One, that the word سَلَام is used to signify severance of relations in a polite manner so as not to cause hurt to his father. This practice has been described in the Holy Qur'an as an attribute of good and pious people. An example in point are the words.\nوَإِذَا خَاطَبَهُمُ الْجَاهِلُونَ قَالُوا سَلَامًا\n\"When ignorant people speak to them, they reply peacefully.\" (25:63)\nIt means that when the ignorant people say foolish things to them they simply say 'Salami (peace) instead of getting involved into an argument with them. This is a way of conveying to them that though I do not agree with your views I will not harm you. The second explanation is that the word سَلَام has been used in the conventional sense. But here the problem is that The Holy Prophet ﷺ has forbidden the believers to be the first to greet an infidel with the word سَلَام on meeting him. The following saying of The Holy Prophet ﷺ has been reported in Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Sayyidna Abu Hurairah ؓ .\nلَا تَبدأ والیھود و النصاریٰ بالسَّلَام\n\"Do not be the first to greet Jews and Christians with the word سَلَام\nOn the other hand Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim have also reported through Sayyidna Usamah ؓ ' that The Holy Prophet ﷺ had greeted first a group of people with the word in which infidels, polytheists and Muslims were all present.\nThis explains the differences which have developed among jurists on the question of propriety or otherwise of this practice. By their words and actions eminent companions (of the Holy Prophet ﷺ), their followers and leaders of religious thought have expressed different views on this issue. Qurtubi has treated this subject in great detail while explaining this verse in his book Ahkam ul-Qur’ an. Imam An-Nakha` i has ruled that when one meets an infidel, a Jew or a Christian on a religious or a worldly need, then there is no harm in taking lead in greeting him with the word سَلَام ، but one should avoid greeting first when there is no need to meet him. Thus both the sayings of the Prophet ﷺ (حَدِیث) have been reconciled.\nسَأَسْتَغْفِرُ‌ لَكَ رَ‌بِّي (I shall seek forgiveness for you from my Lord - 19:47). Here again the problem is that to ask for forgiveness for the sins of an infidel is prohibited and unlawful by Islamic laws, the Holy Prophet ﷺ had said to his uncle Abu Talib واللہ لاستغفرنّ لک مالم انہ عنہ ، that is;\n\"By God I shall keep on praying to Allah for your forgiveness until I am forbidden to do so by Him.\"\nOn this the following verse was revealed:\nمَا كَانَ لِلنَّبِيِّ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَن يَسْتَغْفِرُ‌وا لِلْمُشْرِ‌كِينَ\n\"It is not for the Prophet and the believers to seek forgiveness for the Mushriks.\" (9:113)\nAfter the revelation of this verse he stopped seeking forgiveness for his uncle.\nThe answer to this confusion is that Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) had promised his father to seek Divine Mercy for him before such a prayer was forbidden. The prohibition was imposed after this event. Allah Ta` ala has mentioned this event in Surah Mumtahinna where this exception is clearly indicated.\nإِلَّا قَوْلَ إِبْرَ‌اهِيمَ لِأَبِيهِ لَأَسْتَغْفِرَ‌نَّ لَكَ\nExcept that Ibrahim said to his father \"Certainly I shall ask pardon for you\". - 60:4.\nThis is more clear in Surah Taubah in the verse following the verse.\nمَا كَانَ لِلنَّبِيِّ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَن يَسْتَغْفِرُ‌وا لِلْمُشْرِ‌كِينَ\n\"It is not for the Prophet and the believers to seek forgiveness for the Mushriks.\" - 9:114.\nوَمَا كَانَ اسْتِغْفَارُ‌ إِبْرَ‌اهِيمَ لِأَبِيهِ إِلَّا عَن مَّوْعِدَةٍ وَعَدَهَا إِيَّاهُ فَلَمَّا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ أَنَّهُ عَدُوٌّ لِّلَّـهِ تَبَرَّ‌أَ مِنْهُ\n\"And the prayer of Ibrahim for the forgiveness of his father was not but due to a promise he had made to him. Later, when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he withdrew himself from him.\" - 9:114.\nThis shows that Sayyidna Ibrahim's (علیہ السلام) promise to his father to invoke Allah's Mercy for him was made before the latter's firm adherence to infidelity, and his hostility to Allah became clearly evident. When the position was no longer in doubt Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) announced his dissociation from his father."},{"SurahNumber":19,"VerseNumber":48,"Text":"وَأَعْتَزِلُكُمْ وَمَا تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّـهِ وَأَدْعُو رَ‌بِّي\nAnd go away from you and what you invoke besides Allah. And I shall invoke my Lord.\" - 19:48.\nOn the one hand Sayyidna Khalilullah (علیہ السلام) went to the extreme to show his respect and love for his father, which has been described above, and on the other hand he did not allow the slightest doubt to be cast on his expression of the universal truth (حق) or on his total belief in it.

In this verse the prophets have not been mentioned in the order in which they were granted missions of prophethood, because Idris (علیہ السلام) who has been mentioned last was, in fact, the earliest of them all.\nكَانَ صَادِقَ الْوَعْدِ\n\"He was indeed true to his promise.\" - 19:54.\nFulfillment of promise .is regarded as an important part of the moral code by all decent men, just as a breach of it is considered worthy of contempt. A saying of the Holy Prophet ﷺ has described the breaking of promise as a sign of hypocrisy. Thus, none of the prophets and messengers of Allah have been accused of bad faith / a breach of promise.\nHere certain attributes have been assigned to some of the prophets, but this does not mean that the other prophets did not possess them. It only suggests that these special attributes distinguish them from all the other prophets, just as Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) has been described as مُخلَص . All the other prophets possessed this quality, but it has been specifically applied to Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) . Hence a special mention of him with the attribute.\nSayyidna Ismail (علیہ السلام) occupies a place of honour where keeping a promise is concerned and he stood by his promise whether made to Allah or to humans. He fulfilled his promise to Allah that he would offer himself for sacrifice and will not be found wanting in courage. When the time came he stood by his promise. Once, he promised to meet a man at an appointed place and time. The man did not turn up at the appointed time, but Sayyidna Ismail\tعلیہ السلام waited for him at the place for three days, and according to another tradition for full one year. (Mazhari) A similar incident is reported about The Holy Prophet ﷺ by Tirmidhi on the authority of Abdullah Ibn Ari Al-Khamsa that he waited for three days for someone who had promised to meet him at a particular place. (Qurtubi)\nImportance of keeping one's promise.\nFulfillment of promise is a distinctive trait of the character of the prophets and the pious, and a normal code of conduct with all decent persons. Breaking of a promise, on the other hand, is a habit of the wicked, mean and liars. A saying of The Holy Prophet ﷺ is اَلعدۃ دَین \"A promise is like a debt.\" i.e. it is as obligatory to honour a promise as it is to repay a debt. There is another saying of The Holy Prophet ﷺ which says وای المؤمن واجب . It means that \"promise is an obligation for a believer.\"\nJurists are all agreed that a promise is a debt and its fulfillment obligatory, but only in the sense that its violation without a religious (شرعِی) excuse is a sin though no remedy can be sought for its breach in a court of law. In the language of the Jurists a debt is an obligation which is enforceable, while a promise is not."},{"SurahNumber":19,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"A reformer must begin his mission with his own family\nكَانَ يَأْمُرُ‌ أَهْلَهُ بِالصَّلَاةِ وَالزَّكَاةِ\n\"And he used to bid Salah and Zakah to his family.\" - 19:55.\nA special attribute of Sayyidna Ismail (علیہ السلام) is that he used to direct his family members to offer prayers and pay obligatory charity (الزَّكَاةِ ). Here the question arises that all Muslims are required to advise their family members to perform good deeds as the Qur'an addresses the believers\nقُوا أَنفُسَكُمْ وَأَهْلِيكُمْ نَارً‌ا\n\"Save yourself and your family members from the Fire (of Hell).\" - 66:6.\nThen why has a special mention been made of Sayyidna Ismail (علیہ السلام) in this matter? The fact is, that although this injunction applies to all Muslims, Sayyidna Ismail (علیہ السلام) used to make special efforts in following this directive. Likewise, the Holy Prophet ﷺ also received special directive to warn his family members and close relations against Allah's wrath وَأَنذِرْ‌ عَشِيرَ‌تَكَ الْأَقْرَ‌بِينَ (and warn the nearest people of your clan - 26:214). As a consequence he assembled them all and conveyed to them Allah's command. The other point to consider here is that prophets are sent by Allah for the guidance of entire people. They convey Allah's message to everyone and bind them to obey His command. Then what is the point in making special mention of the members of family? The thing is that there are certain principles which the prophets observe when calling upon people to follow the path of righteousness, and one of them is to give the call first to one's own family members before calling upon the general public. It is a lot easier to prevail upon one's own family members and to monitor their actions. Once the family members have accepted a certain way of life and have started acting on it routinely then it becomes much easier to spread the same message among others at large. When people see for themselves others following a righteous path it becomes much easier to convert them. The most effective means for bringing about an improvement in the character of the people is by creating a religious environment. Experience shows that virtue and vice both proliferate faster and wider in a receptive environment than through teaching and preaching."},{"SurahNumber":19,"VerseNumber":56,"Text":"وَاذْكُرْ‌ فِي الْكِتَابِ إِدْرِ‌يسَ\n\"And mention in the Book (the story of) Idris.\" - 19:56.\nSayyidna Idris (علیہ السلام) lived one thousand years before Sayyidna Nuh (علیہ السلام) and was among his ancestors. (Ruh ul-Ma` ani with reference to Mustadrak al-Hakim). He was the first Prophet after Sayyidna Adam (علیہ السلام) and Allah Ta’ ala bestowed upon him thirty books. (Abi zar- Zamkhashari). Sayyidna Idris (علیہ السلام) was the first man who was given the knowledge of astrology and mathematics through a miracle, (Bahr ul-Muhit). He was also the first man who learnt how to write with a pen, and also the first who invented stitching of cloth, people used to wear animal skins instead of clothes before his time. He also invented measurement tools for the first time. Making of weapons also started in his time and he used them in his wars - the Holy wars\t: جھاد)Jihad) against the descendents of Qabil (بنو قابیل) (Bahr ul-Muhit, Qurtubi, Mazhari, Ruh ul-Ma ani)"},{"SurahNumber":19,"VerseNumber":57,"Text":"وَرَ‌فَعْنَاهُ مَكَانًا عَلِيًّا\n\"And We raised him to a high place.\" - 19:57.\nIt means that he was granted a special position among prophets and was close to Allah Ta` ala. There are also other versions about his ascent to the sky, about which Ibn-e-Kathir has said\nھٰذا من اخبار کعب الاحبار الاسرایٔلیات وفی بعضہ نکارۃ\n\"This is taken from the traditions of the Israelites as reported by Ka'ab Al-Ahbar, some of which are disputed, and unfamiliar.\"\nThe Qur'anic words are not specific on the subject whether he was given a sublime position or was physically lifted to the sky. Therefore, his physical ascent to the sky is not definite. In any case commentary of the Holy Qur'an is not dependent on this issue. (Bayan ul-Qur’ an)\nFrom Bayan ul-Qur'an - The difference between the definition of 'Rasul' and 'Nabi' and their inter-relationship.\n\"The words Rasul and Nabi have been variously explained. Having considered all possibilities I have come to the conclusion that the relationship between the two is on being specific or general on the basis of their application.\nRasul is one who delivers a new code to those among whom he is sent, even though the code may be new to himself as well, like Torah to Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) or the code be new only to his people, as was the case with Sayyidna Ismail (علیہ السلام) . The code that he was preaching was in fact given to his father, Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) ، but it was new for the tribe of Jurhum who did not know about it beforehand, and learnt its details from Sayyidna Ismail (علیہ السلام) only, who was sent to them for this purpose. It, therefore, follows that it is not necessary for a Rasul to be Nabi just as the angels who are Rasul but not Nabi or the messengers sent to Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) who are referred in Qur'an as Rasul, although they were not Nabi. إِذْ جَاءَهَا الْمُرْ‌سَلُونَ (36:13).\nOn the other hand Nabi is the one who is the bearer of Wahy (Allah's message) regardless of whether he preaches an old or a new religious code. Many a prophets from Bani Isra'il fall under this category, as they preached the religious code given to Sayyidna Musa (علیہ السلام) ، therefore, follows that the word Rasul is more general compared to Nabi. But in certain other ways converse is the case. Where the two words are used together, as in the case of this verse where they appear as رَ‌سُولًا نَّبِيًّا ، there is no problem in that they can be taken both in specific or in general term, and there will not be any contradiction. But in such situations where the two words appear separately one against the other, then having regard to the relative position of the two words in the verse the term Nabi will denote someone who is following the religious code brought by someone else."},{"SurahNumber":19,"VerseNumber":58,"Text":"أُولَـٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّـهُ عَلَيْهِم مِّنَ النَّبِيِّينَ مِن ذُرِّ‌يَّةِ آدَمَ\n\"Those are the people whom Allah has blessed with bounties, the prophets from the progeny of Adam.\" - 19.58.\nThis relates only to Sayyidna Idris (علیہ السلام) .\nوَمِمَّنْ حَمَلْنَا مَعَ نُوحٍ\n\"And from those whom We boarded (the Ark) along with Nuh.\" - 19:58.\nThis relates to Sayyidna Ibrahim (علیہ السلام) only,\nوَمِن ذُرِّ‌يَّةِ إِبْرَ‌اهِيمَ\n\"and from the progeny of Ibrahim\" - 19:58.\nThis relates to Ismail, Ishaq and Ya` qub (علیہ السلام) .\nوَإِسْرَ‌ائِيلَ\n\"and Isra'il\" - 19:58.\nThis points out to Sayyidna Musa, Haran, Zakariyya and Yahya and ` Isa (علیہم السلام) .\nإِذَا تُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتُ الرَّ‌حْمَـٰنِ خَرُّ‌وا سُجَّدًا وَبُكِيًّا\n\"When the verses of The Rahman (All-Merciful) are recited before them they fall down in Sajdah (prostration), weeping.\" -19:58.\nSome very prominent prophets have been mentioned in the preceding verses as also their exalted status. Thus, there was a real danger that people might raise them to an exaggerated and high position as was the case with Jews who treated Sayyidna ` Uzair (علیہ السلام) as God, or the Christians who elevated Sayyidna ` Isa (علیہ السلام) to a level where they called him the son of God. Therefore, after the mention of all those prophets it was made very clear in the very next verse that they were all very God-fearing and used to prostrate (سَجدَہ) themselves before Allah in extreme reverence. It is to avoid any possibility of crossing the limits of reverence for them (Bayan ul-Qur'an).\nWeeping during the recitation of Qur'an / Divine Book was the Practice of the Prophets (علیہ السلام)\nWeeping while reciting Qur'an is a commendable act and was also an attribute of the prophets. It has been reported that The Holy Prophet ﷺ ، his companions, their followers and the God-fearing people followed this practice.\nQurtubi has reported that religious scholars consider it desirable that when going into Sajdah after reciting a verse of Sajdah (آیَت سجدہ) one should recite a prayer which is appropriate to the verse of Sajdah (آیَتِ سجدہ). For instance in Surah Sajdah (surah # 32) the following prayer be recited.\nاللَّھُم اجعَلنِی مِنَ السَّاجِدِینَ لِوَجھِکَ المُسَبِّحِینَ بِحَمدِکَ وَاَعُوذُ بِک اَن اَکُونَ مِنَ المُستَکبِرِینَ عَن اَمرِکَ\n(0 Allah, make me of those who prostrate to You alone, and who glorify You along with proclaiming Your praise. And I seek refuge with You from being of those who turn their faces, in arrogance, against Your command.)\nWhile in the case of Sajdah at verse # 109 of (Surah Bani Isra'il) one should recite.\nاللَّھُمَّ اَجعَلنِی مِنَ البَاکِینَ اِلَیکَ الخَاشِعِینَ لَکَ\n(0 Allah, make me of those who weep before You and who are humble in heart before You.)\nAnd for the verse of Sajdah under reference the following should be recited.\nاللَّھُمَّ اجعَلنِی مِن عِبَادِکَ المُنعِمِ عَلَیھِمُ المَھدِیِّینَ السَّاجِدِینَ لِکِ البَاکِینَ عِندَ تِلَاوَۃِ آیَاتِکَ\n( O Allah make me of those among Your slaves upon whom You bestowed Your bounties, who prostrate before You, who weep while reciting Your verses.)

It includes the customary greetings (سَلَام), which the dwellers of Paradise will exchange among themselves and the angels of God will offer them all.

There will also be some way of telling day from night and morning from evening. Within this distinction between morning and evening the Paradise dwellers will receive their meals. It goes without saying that the wishes of the Paradise dwellers will be fulfilled forthwith وَلَهُم مَّا يَشْتَهُونَ - and for themselves, there is what they desire - 16:57). This is a general announcement. Hence, mention of morning and evening is because of people's habit to eat and drink in the morning and in the evening. According to an Arab saying, anyone who gets a full meal morning and evening is comfortable and at peace.\nSayyidna Anas Ibn Malik ؓ ، said after reciting this verse that it shows that the believers have their meals twice a day, one in the morning and the other in the evening.\nSome scholars have explained that mention of morning and the evening is a general expression, like day and night or east and west, which does not specify any particular time or place. Therefore, it means that they (Paradise dwellers) will get their provisions according to their choice at any time they like.

First, that on the Day of Judgment every infidel will be brought before God along with his own devil, and this suggests that this is a reference to the gathering of infidels and their devils. But if it is interpreted in a general sense to include all believers and infidels then the meaning of the devils being gathered with all of them would be that while the infidels will be gathered with their devils, the believers would also be gathered at the same time and place.
