Why are you weeping' He replied: `I remembered the statement of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, in His Book,\nعَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ - تَصْلَى نَاراً حَامِيَةً\n(Laboring, weary. They will enter into Fire, Hamiyah.) So that is what has made me cry. \"' Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said,\nعَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ\n(Laboring, weary.) \"The Christians.\" It is narrated that `Ikrimah and As-Suddi both said, \"Laboring in the worldly life with disobedience, and weariness in the Fire from torment and perdition.\" Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, and Qatadah all said,\nتَصْلَى نَاراً حَامِيَةً\n(They will enter into Fire, Hamiyah) meaning, hot with intense heat.\nتُسْقَى مِنْ عَيْنٍ ءَانِيَةٍ\n(They will be given to drink from a boiling (Aniyah) spring.) meaning, its heat has reached its maximum limit and boiling point. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi. Concerning Allah's statement,\nلَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ\n(No food will there be for them but from Dari`,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"A tree from the Hellfire.\" Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-Jawza' and Qatadah, all said, \"It is Ash-Shibriq (a type of plant).\" Qatadah said, \"The Quraysh called it Ash-Shabraq in the spring and Ad-Dari` in the summer.\" `Ikrimah said, \"It is a thorny tree which reaches down to the ground.\" Al-Bukhari related that Mujahid said, \"Ad-Dari` is a plant that is called Ash-Shibriq. The people of the Hijaz call it Ad-Dari` when it dries, and it is poisonous.\" Ma`mar narrated that Qatadah said,\nلَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ\n(No food will there be for them but from Dari`,) \"This is Ash-Shibriq. When it dries it is called Ad-Dari`.\" Sa`id narrated from Qatadah that he said,\nلَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ\n(No food will there be for them but Dari`,) \"This is of the worst, most disgusting and loathsome of foods.\" Concerning Allah's statement,\nلاَّ يُسْمِنُ وَلاَ يُغْنِى مِن جُوعٍ\n(Which will neither nourish nor avail against hunger.) This means that the intent in eating it will not be achieved, and nothing harmful will be repelled by it."},{"SurahNumber":88,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"The Condition of the People of Paradise on the Day of Judgement\nAfter mentioning the situation of the wretched people, Allah changes the discussion to mention those who will be happy.

They are reminded of this because the most common domestic animal of the Arabs was the camel.
