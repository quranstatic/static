The cause may be related to his political opinions and defense position for emigrants rights as he was the head of Eritrean community in Saudi Arabia. After that sheikh Tawfik went to Bahrain where he lives now and works as Imam and Quran reciter, he was given Bahraini nationality. He is the head of Al-Hudah publishing house which published the whole Quran recorded by his voice.","RecitationStyle":null,"Qirat":null}
