Upon entering the Masjid and not understanding how I ended up coming to the Masjid I was drawn to the lecture that was taking place in the hall. I was later introduced to the lecturer Brother Javed, who kindly offered me some literature, books and audio cassettes. It happen to be that those material had a profound effect on me with the help of Allah, those Dawah materials changed my life completely.\nAlhamdulillah Allah gave me hidayah, I started praying regularly, and started to memorise the Qur’an and seeking ISLAMIC knowledge. I found that in learning and recitation the Qur’an did my heart finally found that peace and tranquillity that I was longing for!\n“Those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah – Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah, Verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.” (Surah 13: Verse 28)\nI have learned the recitation of the Qur’an from Qari Sohaib Ahmed, who is well known reciter in the MiddleEast and Asia. I was motivated to recite the Qur’an to the best of my abilities and wanting to attract others, specially the youths who listen to other than Qur’an and hoping to attract them to Islam by the means of Al-Qur’an.\nAlhamdulillah I had some success in this mission, and insh’Allah pray that I am able to constantly increase my efforts until I meet my Rab the most High. May He the most High accept this from me/us and that He may make us all successful in this world and the hereafter ….
