Do not say (in your relationship and conversations with God’s Messenger,) ra‘ina (please attend to us), but say, unzurna (favor us with your attention), and pay heed to him. (And be assured that) for the unbelievers (who are disrespectful to God’s Messenger) is a painful punishment"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":105,"Text":"Those who disbelieve among the People of the Book (by denying any of the Prophets or Divine Books or associating partners with God or cherishing enmity to His angels or in another way), and those who associate partners with God (among the people of Makkah and others) love not that there should be sent down on you any good from your Lord. But God singles out for His mercy (of favoring with Prophethood or another similar mission) whom He wills. God is of tremendous grace"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":106,"Text":"(Though they would exploit the abrogation of some rules of secondary degree to challenge your authority, the truth is that) We do not abrogate any verse or omit it (leaving it to be forgotten) but We bring one better than it or the like of it (more suited to the time and conditions in the course of perfecting religion and completing Our favor upon you).

Whoever exchanges faith for unbelief has surely strayed from the right, even way"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":109,"Text":"Many among the People of the Book, out of the envy ingrained in their souls, wish they could restore you as unbelievers after you have believed, after the truth was clear to them (that the Qur’an is God’s Word and Muhammad is the last, awaited Messenger). Yet pardon and overlook them (avoiding useless debates and polemics with them) until God brings in His verdict about them. Surely God has full power over everything"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":110,"Text":"(Let your concern be to) establish the Prayer in conformity with its conditions and pay the Prescribed Purifying Alms.
