By it the prophets who submitted to God were to judge those of the Jewish Faith, and so would the rabbis and the clerics, according to God‘s Book which had been committed to their keeping and to which they themselves were witnesses. Have no fear of people; fear Me, and do not sell My revelations for a paltry sum. Unbelievers are those who do not judge according to God‘s revelations"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":45,"Text":"Therein We decreed for them a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and a wound for a wound.

Wrongdoers are those that do not judge according to what God has revealed"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":46,"Text":"In their trail We sent forth Jesus son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him; and We gave him the Gospel, in which there is guidance and light, corroborating what was revealed before him in the Torah: a guide and an admonition to the righteous"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":47,"Text":"Let those who follow the Gospel judge by what God has revealed in it; ungodly are those that do not judge by what God has revealed"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":48,"Text":"And to you We have revealed the Book with the Truth. It confirms the Book which came before it and supersedes it. Therefore pronounce judgement among them by what God has revealed and do not follow their whims or swerve from the Truth made known to you. For each of you We have ordained a law and assigned a path. Had God pleased, He could have made of you but one community: but it is His wish to prove you by that which He has given you. Vie with each other in good works; to God shall you all return and He will resolve your differences for you"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":49,"Text":"Pronounce judgement among them by what God has revealed and do not follow their whims. Beware of them, lest they tempt you away from a part of that which God has revealed to you. If they turn away, know that it is God‘s wish to scourge them for some of their sins. A great many people are ungodly"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":50,"Text":"Is it the pagan laws that they wish to be judged by? And who is a better judge than God for those whose faith is firm"}]}
