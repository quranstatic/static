You enjoin equity and you recourse to general principles of justice. You forbid all that is wrongful and obscene and you conform your will to Allah’s blessed will"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":111,"Text":"They will not hurt your interests O Mohammad nor will they harm you. They will only be a source of annoyance. If they war against you they will turn tail and seek safety in flight and will not be crowned with victory"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":112,"Text":"They have been stamped with humiliation (The Jews) wherever they are found, except when they come to be under the tutelage of Allah and at peace with people. They came within the measure of Allah’s wrath and they were stamped with mortification of pride. Their unjustifiable slaying of the Prophets was in the train of their defiance of piety. Their disobedience was natural to them that it became an addiction to transgression"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":113,"Text":"But in fairness to them, Ahl AL-Kitab are not all alike. Among them are a people who conform their will to Allah’s blessed will; a people who recite verses of Allah’s revelations by night and bow to the ground in reverence and adoration and prostrate their reason to divine revelation"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":114,"Text":"They believe in Allah with hearts impressed with images of religious and spiritual virtues and they are mindful of the Hereafter.

Their yield was hit by an icy cold wind that reduced it to ruin. It was not Allah Who did them injustice but it was they who wronged themselves"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":118,"Text":"O you people whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues: do not have as intimate associates a body of persons of another law; they shall not hesitate to pervert you. They eagerly wish to overthrow you or bring an irretrievable disaster upon you. Nature has written a letter of discredit upon their faces that reflect hatred; such a hatred that is portrayed in their thoughts which they express in words, but worse is what their bosoms conceal. We have made to you Our revelations clear and plain if only you have soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":119,"Text":"You see how you hold them dear and entertain great regard for them while they do not reciprocate the same feeling. You give credence to all the Books which Allah has revealed while they do not. When they come face to face with you they declare that they have conformed their will to Allah’s blessed will but when they are apart from you, they bite their lips and their finger tips in the rage of distemper. Say to them O Muhammad: \"Perish those whose minds are backwards and perish you in the rage of your distemper; Allah is indeed 'Alimun of all private thoughts and feelings in the breast"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":120,"Text":"If good fortune falls to you, be it through victory or through martyrdom, they come to be actuated by envy and grieved at heart.
