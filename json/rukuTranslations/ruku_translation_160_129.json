This is only what they say and it is similar to what the unbelievers who lived before them had said. May God destroy them wherever they exist"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":31,"Text":"They (unconditionally) obeyed the rabbis and the monks and worshipped the Messiah, son of Mary, as they should have obeyed God. They were commanded to worship no one besides God who is the only God and who is too exalted to be considered equal to any idols"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":32,"Text":"They would like to extinguish the light of God with a blow from their mouths, but even though the unbelievers may dislike it, God has decided to let His light shine forever"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":33,"Text":"It is God Who sent His Messenger with guidance and a true religion that will prevail over all other religions, even though the pagans may dislike it"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":34,"Text":"Believers, many rabbis and monks consume other people's property by false means and create obstacles in the way of God. Those who horde gold and silver and do not spend (anything out of it) for the cause of God, should know that their recompense will be a painful torment"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":35,"Text":"on the Day of Judgment and that their treasures will be heated by the fire of hell and pressed against their foreheads, sides and back with this remark, \"These are your own treasures which you hoarded for yourselves.

Know that God is with the pious ones"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":37,"Text":"To disregard the observation of the sacred months and to observe it during the non-sacred months is to add more to one's disbelief. This causes the unbelievers to go further astray. One year they (the pagans) consider a sacred month not sacred, (and observe it during a non-sacred month) but the next year they consider it sacred at the right time. By dealing with the sacred months in such a manner, they think that they have observed the laws of God, but, in fact, they have changed them. Their evil deeds seem attractive to them but God does not guide the unbelieving people"}]}
