Then, once they performed Sajdah, they should move away from you, and the other party, that has not yet performed Salah, should come and perform Salah with you, and should take their precautionary measures and their arms. Those who disbelieve would want you to become heedless to your arms and your belongings, so that they come down upon you in a single move. There is no sin on you, if you have some inconvenience due to rain, or you are sick, in putting your arms aside, but take your precautionary measures. Surely, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":103,"Text":"Once you have finished your Salah, then, remember Allah while standing, sitting and reclining.
