Let not one ethnic group ridicule another ethnic group. It may just be that those being mocked are actually better. Similarly, do not let (some) women deride other women, because the women being laughed at, may happen to be better. Do not defame or slander each other. Do not yell (racial, ethnic or other) slurs and epithets at each other. After entering faith, it is not right to insult others with disdainful names. Those who fail to repent and desist are really the evildoers"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"Oh you who believe! Avoid being overly suspicious. Some suspicions are, in fact, outright sins. Do not engage in (unwarranted) curiosity; and do not speak ill of others behind their back. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? (Surely) you would feel disgust (at such a thought). So fear Allah! Indeed, Allah accepts repentance and is the most Kind"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"Oh you people! We have certainly created you from one man, and a woman. Then We (multiplied you and) formed you into nations and tribes, (just) so you may identify and recognize each other.

Of course, Allah is the most Forgiving, and the most Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"The (true) believers are actually those who believe in Allah and His messenger and then do not waver (and do not entertain doubts). With their wealth and their lives, they strive for the sake of Allah. Such are truly the sincere ones"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"Say, \"Are you trying to inform Allah about your beliefs? Allah knows everything in the heavens and on earth. Allah is well-Aware of every single thing"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":17,"Text":"Because they have submitted to Islam, they boast of having done you a favor.
