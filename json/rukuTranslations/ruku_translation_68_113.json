Do not come near ´salat´ if you are drunk, until you know what you utter. Nor if you are spiritually unclean (after a sexual contact) _ unless you are traveling _ until you (bathe and) clean yourself. If you are sick or traveling, or if any of you has been to the toilet, or if you have come in (sexual) contact with (your) women and you do not find water (to clean yourself), then perform ´Tayyamum´. Find a clean slab of soil and (after touching it) run your hand over your face and hands. Indeed, Allah is Lenient and Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":44,"Text":"Do you not look at those, who were given a portion of the scriptures? They use it to purchase misguidance! They want you to lose the right path, too"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":45,"Text":"And Allah knows your enemies very well. As your protector, Allah is sufficient! Allah is sufficient as a helper"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":46,"Text":"(Oh prophet), among the Jews are some, who (when they come to visit you) change words out of context. (They use pun and play upon words. They pretend to say, ´we heard and we obeyed´, and ´wait, we did not hear´. Instead, with a twist of their tongue, they make it sound (as if they said), \"We heard and we disobeyed\", and \"Listen, may you go deaf!\" and ´Raina´ _ (an insult in Hebrew). Thus, they slander the (true) faith. It would have been much better for them and more upright, had they said, \"We heard and we obey\" and \"Listen to us, and be patient with us\". Because of their disbelief, Allah has cursed them! Little is what they believe"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":47,"Text":"Oh you who were given the scriptures (earlier)! Believe in the revelation We have sent (to Muhammad, SAW), confirming your earlier scriptures. Believe it, before We (distort and) blot out your faces and make them reel backwards. Or We may lay a curse on them like We cursed the people of the Sabbath-breakers. The command of Allah always comes to pass"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":48,"Text":"In fact, Allah does not forgive ´shirk´ _ (an act of associating others as equal to Him). Baring that, He may forgive anything He wants, and whomever He pleases. The one who commits ´shirk´ has indeed invented a singularly sinister sin"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":49,"Text":"Haven´t you seen those, who (boast and) claim sanctity for themselves? It is, in fact, Allah Who (purifies and) sanctifies whomever He wants.
