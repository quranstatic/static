Anyone who kills a mumin by mistake should free a mumin slave and pay blood-money to his family unless they forgo it as a sadaqa. If he is from a people who are your enemies and is a mumin, you should free a mumin slave. If he is from a people you have a treaty with, blood money should be paid to his family and you should free a mumin slave. Anyone who cannot find the means should fast two consecutive months. This is a concession from Allah. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":93,"Text":"As for anyone who kills a mumin deliberately, his repayment is Hell, remaining in it for ever. Allah is angry with him and has cursed him, and has prepared for him a terrible punishment"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":94,"Text":"You who have iman! when you go out to fight in the Way of Allah verify things carefully. Do not say, ´You are not a mumin´, to someone who greets you as a Muslim, simply out of desire for the goods of this world. With Allah there is booty in abundance. That is the way you were before but Allah has been kind to you. So verify things carefully.

Allah has promised the Best to both, but Allah has preferred those who do jihad over those who stay behind by an immense reward"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":96,"Text":"high ranks conferred by Him as well as forgiveness and mercy.
