Those who are not able to earn enough living to meet their basic needs, for any reason. Those whose running businesses have stalled or the ones who have lost their jobs, who have become needy with their active lives coming to a standstill. Officers who have been appointed by the government to collect alms and charity. Those who are hindered from joining the Divine System for financial reasons. To free men and women from bondage of any kind: physical slavery, unjust captivity, and oppression from any quarters. Those pressed under the load of ransom or heavy debt from an enemy. Defense of the Ideological State, in the Cause of Allah. The wayfarer who becomes needy, or travels to the believers in destitute condition, and the homeless son of the street. This is a Duty from Allah. He is the Knower, the Wise and His Commands are based on Knowledge and Wisdom"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":61,"Text":"And among those (enemies of the Truth) are some who hurt the Prophet and say, \" He is only a hearer.\" Say, \"A listener, that is good for you. He believes in Allah, has faith in the believers, and is a Mercy to those of you who believe.\" Those who vex and hurt the Messenger of Allah, for them is an awful punishment. (The Messenger is not an emperor or a king who keep guards around them. He is accessible to all at all time and it is good for you that he pays attention to everyone)"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":62,"Text":"(O You who believe) People swear by Allah to you in order to please you (and improve personal relations). But it is more fitting that they should please Allah and His Messenger, if they really believe (and embrace the Divine Ideology)"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":63,"Text":"Don't they know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, for him verily is Hellfire, to abide therein? That is the supreme disgrace"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":64,"Text":"The hypocrites fear that a Surah might be revealed concerning them, exposing what is in their hearts. Say, \"Go on mocking! Allah will bring to light exactly what you are dreading"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":65,"Text":"And if you ask them (O Messenger), they will say, \"We only talk and jest.\" Say, \"Do you realize that you are mocking Allah, His Revelations and His Messenger"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":66,"Text":"Make no excuse. You have disbelieved after your confession of belief.\" If We forgive a group of you, there is another group whom We shall punish since they have violated human rights by stealing the fruit of others' labor.\" (Unless they restore their rights (4:17), (9:102), (25)"}]}
