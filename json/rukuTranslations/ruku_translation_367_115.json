Do not enter the houses of the Prophet without permission, nor stay waiting for meal time: but if you are invited to a meal, enter, and when you have eaten disperse and do not seek long conversation. Such behavior annoys the Prophet, he feels shy in asking you to leave, but Allah does not feel shy in telling the truth. If you have to ask his wives for anything, speak to them from behind a curtain. This is more chaste for your hearts and for theirs. It is not proper for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever to marry his wives after him; this would be a grievous offence in the sight of Allah"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Whether you reveal anything or conceal it, surely Allah has full knowledge of all things"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"There is no blame on the ladies if they appear before their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons, their familiar women and those whom their right hands possess (slaves).
