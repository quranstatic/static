He causes the day to lose its identity and its character by absorption into the night; both revolving swiftly in pursuit of each other and one dies into the other**. And the sun, the moon and the stars, He has governed by His cosmic laws and reduced to a state of subservience by His command. Indeed to Him belongs the creation of the whole and of all in all. Praise be to Allah, Creator of the universe and extolled are His glorious attributes"},{"SurahNumber":7,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"Invoke Allah, your Creator, with bated breath and whispering humbleness and in secret; He does not like the law transgressors, who go beyond the limits prescribed by Him"},{"SurahNumber":7,"VerseNumber":56,"Text":"Nor does He like those who create discord and make mischief on earth after it has been set in order. And invoke Him with mingled feeling of dread of his just punishment and with reverence, hope and expectation of His mercy and blessings His mercy is indeed in immediate proximity of those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety"},{"SurahNumber":7,"VerseNumber":57,"Text":"He is it Who sends forth the wind as a forerunner of His mercy heralding a joyful event The watery vapor condenses and floats in the upper air and when it is about to gender a storm We drive it by high winds to a dead or droughty land where it pours its rain and with it We cause the various products to spring up from the soil*. Similarly do We resurrect the dead; an action consequent on Allah's will and it is hoped people will ponder"},{"SurahNumber":7,"VerseNumber":58,"Text":"Physically, the rich soil responds favourably to the fertilizing showers of rain and yields, Allah willing, a rich harvest, -and spiritually, the godly soul' and the clean heart respond favourably to the fertilizing religious conviction and yield piety-, whereas rain physically and admonition spiritually evoke no response in both the bad soil and the evil souls. Thus do We orient Our revelations to circumstances and requirements expounding them to people impelled to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness"}]}
