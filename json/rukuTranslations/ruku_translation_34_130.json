So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: \"We have no power this day against Jalut (Goliath) and his hosts.\" But those who knew with certainty that they were to meet their Lord, said: \"How often a small group overcame a mighty host by Allah's Leave?\" And Allah is with As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc)"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":250,"Text":"And when they advanced to meet Jalut (Goliath) and his forces, they invoked: \"Our Lord!

We preferred some to others; to some of them Allah spoke (directly); others He raised to degrees (of honour); and to 'Iesa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), We gave clear proofs and evidences, and supported him with Ruh-ul-Qudus [Jibrael (Gabriel)]. If Allah had willed, succeeding generations would not have fought against each other, after clear Verses of Allah had come to them, but they differed - some of them believed and others disbelieved. If Allah had willed, they would not have fought against one another, but Allah does what He likes"}]}
