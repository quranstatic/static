O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Abstinence is prescribed for you as it was prescribed to nations before you so that you benefit from this training, and get empowered to walk aright"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":184,"Text":"Just a certain number of days. But, if any of you is sick or is traveling, the number of days should be made up later. For those who can go through Abstinence only with hardship, there is compensation, the feeding of an indigent. Any additional charity will mean additional reward. However, if you knew better, the training course of Abstinence is good for you"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":185,"Text":"The month of Ramadhan has been chosen for your collective training because this is the month in which Revelation of the Qur'an began (with the most revolutionary and Benevolent Message ever). It is Guidance for mankind, and it clearly explains the 'why' of every Rule. And it is the Criterion of right and wrong. So, whoever is at home during this month should participate in the program. Whoever of you is sick or on a journey, let him do Abstinence later. Allah desires for you ease. He desires not hardship for you - and that you should complete the period. (Do not treat this program as just a ritual). The objective of this training is to establish the Greatness of Allah on earth for having placed you on a well-lighted road, and then being practically grateful by sharing His Bounties with others"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":186,"Text":"(This training program has nothing to do with asceticism or self-denial in any way. The mystics think that enduring hardships and denying themselves the basic needs will bring them close to God). And if My servants ask you concerning Me, behold, I am indeed near. I respond to the call of whoever calls, whenever he calls unto Me. So let them hear My Call and let them trust in Me, that they may be led aright"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":187,"Text":"(The Abstinence is only for the daytime. Eating, drinking, and going to your wives is not forbidden during the night). It is Lawful to go to your wives on the night of the Abstinence. They are your garments and you are their garments - close to each other, source of mutual comfort, complementing each other, trustworthy and keepers of privacy, reason for decor, and redressers of faults. ('Libas' embraces all the meanings given). Allah turns to you in Kindness and dispels and pardons your unworthy fears of disobedience at night. Freeing yourselves of misconceptions, keep seeking in life that Allah has decreed to be available for you. So, eat and drink until the white line of dawn becomes distinct for you from the black line of night. Then you shall be in Abstinence until night begins to fall. During this training program, some of you will be called on deputation in local Centers of the Divine Order. (This will be an assignment from the State. During that special duty you will learn, consult and plan the governmental and social affairs). So you will have to divert your attention from personal matters, even from intimately touching your wives. These are the limits imposed by Allah, so overstep them not. Thus it is that Allah explains His Messages to mankind that they may walk aright"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":188,"Text":"(When you abstain from the Permissible during the annual training period, you empower yourselves to easily refrain from the forbidden.) So, devour not the wealth and property of one another unjustly, nor bribe the officials or the judges to deprive others of their possessions. Know that this kind of behavior drags down the individual and collective potential of the society"}]}
