Most of them act ignorantly"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":112,"Text":"We have set up Shaitans _ among the jinn and the human kind _ as enemies against every prophet. They inspire and provoke each other with their suave and specious speech. They could not have done that, had your Lord so willed. So leave them alone with the falsehood they cook up"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":113,"Text":"We let the heart of the unbelievers _those not believing in the life-to-come _ lean towards falsehood (and be titillated by it). Let them be contented with it, so they may amass all the evil deeds they please"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":114,"Text":"Ask them, \"Now, shall I seek someone other than Allah as a judge, even though it is He Who has revealed to you the detailed book (the QurÂ´an)?\" Those to whom We had previously given the book, know well that it is indeed revealed by your Lord. That it is the absolute truth! So do not be among the skeptics"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":115,"Text":"The word of Allah is perfectly fair and accurate. None can dare change His decrees. He hears-all and knows all"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":116,"Text":"Most of the people of this world _ if you choose to follow them _ would lead you far away from the path of Allah.

He has already detailed for you everything that is forbidden for you _ unless you are compelled by dire reasons. Of course, many mislead others without much knowledge, and because of their own lusts and longings. Your Lord knows the transgressors"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":120,"Text":"Give up sin (in its entirety) _ in appearance as well as in essence. Those who commit sins would surely be punished according to what they had committed"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":121,"Text":"Do not eat the meat (of the animals) over which the name of Allah is not invoked (at the time of its slaughter). That is an impious and an immoral act. Shaitan certainly incites his minions to engage you in arguments (about what is, and is not a sin). If you follow them you would surely become one of those who associate partners with Allah"}]}
