As for those who take other lords besides Him, ˹saying,˺ “We worship them only so they may bring us closer to God,” surely God will judge between all regarding what they differed about. God certainly does not guide whoever persists in lying and disbelief"},{"SurahNumber":39,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"Had it been God’s Will to have offspring, He could have chosen whatever He willed of His creation. Glory be to Him! He is God—the One, the Supreme"},{"SurahNumber":39,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"He created the heavens and the earth for a purpose.
