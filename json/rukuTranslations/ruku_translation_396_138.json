Therefore, serve Allah sincere in your Faith in Him alone"},{"SurahNumber":39,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Know and make it known that the Pristine Religion is for Allah and from Him alone. And yet, they who take patrons besides Him say, \"We worship them for no other reason than they bring us nearer to Allah.\" (5:35), (10:18), (17:57). Behold, Allah judges them (right in this Revelation) concerning that wherein they differ. Verily, Allah does not intervene to guide anyone who is a liar unto himself, thankless to his own detriment"},{"SurahNumber":39,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"And if Allah had willed to take unto Himself a son, He could have chosen anyone that He wanted out of what He has created.

He creates you in the bellies of your mothers, creation after creation, in threefold depths of darkness (the abdominal wall, the uterine wall and the embryonic sac). Such is Allah, your Lord!

He does not approve of ingratitude in His servants. And if you are grateful, He approves it for you. And no laden one will bear the burden of another. Ultimately, unto your Lord is your return.

But as soon as He bestows upon him Bliss, he forgets Him Whom he called before, and he claims that there are other powers that can rival Allah - thus misleading others from His Path.
