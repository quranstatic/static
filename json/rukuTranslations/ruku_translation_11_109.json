But then you turned away in aversion, all except a few of you; in fact you are a people always avoiding your compacts and responsibilities"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":84,"Text":"And (remember also) when We took a promise from you: you shall not shed blood among yourselves, and shall not expel one another from your habitations. You confirmed it, and you yourselves were (and still must be) witnesses to it"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":85,"Text":"Then, here you are, killing one another, and expelling a party of your own from their habitations, conspiring against them in iniquity and enmity. If you take them as captives, you hold them to ransom, and if they are brought to you as captives, you ransom them; yet their expulsion was made religiously forbidden to you. Then (like a people having no sense) do you believe in part of the Book, and disbelieve in part? What else, then, could be the recompense of those of you who act thus than disgrace in the life of this world? On the Day of Resurrection, they will be consigned to the severest of punishment. God is not unaware and unmindful of what you do"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":86,"Text":"Such are the ones who have bought the present, worldly life (the life of corporeal desires and ambitions) in exchange for the Hereafter. So (in consequence of this exchange) the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be helped (not saved from the punishment in any of the ways they resort to in the world such as bribery, influence, or unjust intercession)"}]}
