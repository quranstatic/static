The Fire will be their home—what an evil place for the wrongdoers to stay"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":152,"Text":"Indeed, God fulfilled His promise to you when you ˹initially˺ swept them away by His Will, then your courage weakened and you disputed about the command and disobeyed, after God had brought victory within your reach.

They say ˹to themselves˺, “If we had any say in the matter, none of us would have come to die here.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Even if you were to remain in your homes, those among you who were destined to be killed would have met the same fate.” Through this, God tests what is within you and purifies what is in your hearts.
