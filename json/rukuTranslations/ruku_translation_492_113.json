If you (must) divorce your women, divorce them for a (prescribed) period. Count the period (correctly). Fear Allah, your Lord, and do not _ unless they have committed a flagrantly immoral act _ expel your divorced women out of their homes. The women too should not leave their homes.

(During that period), Allah may well bring about something (to cause reconciliation between the husband and wife)"},{"SurahNumber":65,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"At the end of the (prescribed) period, either hold back your women (in wedlock) lawfully, according to the well-known (prescribed) manner, or make the divorce final in accordance with the well known (prescribed) way. Take two of your fair minded (and respected) men as your witnesses. (Oh witnesses)! Bear the witness truthfully for the sake of Allah! Those who believe in Allah, and the life-to-come, are hereby being asked to heed. Allah will provide a way out for the one who fears Him"},{"SurahNumber":65,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"And, He would grant the bounties (and provisions) from sources they had not expected (or even imagined).

Do not abuse and mistreat them, in order to harass them. If they happen to be carrying (your) child, then spend and bear their expenses till they carry their pregnancies to term. If they are nursing (your child), then compensate them in a fair and equitable manner. Settle the issue (of compensation) between you and your (former) wives amicably.
