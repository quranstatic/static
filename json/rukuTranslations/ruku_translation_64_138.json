If any woman or a group of women spread sexual immorality or lewdness in the society, it is required that the appropriate court takes four honorable and reliable witnesses. If their testimony corroborates with other evidence (12:26), confine them to their houses, since immorality is as contagious as good conduct. This confinement would be for an indefinite period, unless such women seek the Way of Allah, such as repentance and amendment, or the singles among them get honorably married"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"If a couple spreads such immorality or lewdness in the society, both of them shall be punished by the appropriate court of law.
