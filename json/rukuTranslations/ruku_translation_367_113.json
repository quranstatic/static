Do not enter the prophet´s home, especially at mealtime, unless you have been granted permission. If you are invited to dine at the prophet´s home, arrive on time (not too early) and disperse after you have finished eating. Do not overstay and linger on in conversation. That bothers the prophet, and he is too embarrassed to tell you. But Allah is not ashamed of telling the truth! When you have to ask the wives of the prophet about anything, do so from across a screen. That is more upright, and it keeps your and their hearts more unadultrated. It is not right for you to aggravate the prophet, and it is improper for you to ever marry any of his wives after his death. Indeed that, according to Allah, is a serious offence"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Allah is Aware of every single thing, regardless of whether you express it or keep it undisclosed"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"It is not improper for the ladies (and will not be held against them), if they converse freely with their fathers, their sons, their brothers and their sons, their sisters´ sons and other women _ including the slave women.

He has prepared for them a humialiating punishment"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":58,"Text":"Those who distress the believing men and women (by levelling false charges against them) without any reason bear the burden of having slandered a believer _ a glaring sin"}]}
