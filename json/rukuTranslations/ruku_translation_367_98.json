Don’t enter the houses of the prophet, except when permission is given to you for a meal, and then don’t wait for its preparation. But when you are invited, then enter and when you have taken your meal, then disperse, without sitting for a talk. Surely, such behavior annoys the prophet, he is shy in asking you to leave, but Allah is not shy of telling you the truth. When you ask them (his wives) for anything, ask them from behind a curtain. This is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. It is not proper for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor that you should ever marry his wives after him (his death). Surely! With Allah that would be a grievous offence"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Whether you reveal anything or conceal it, surely, Allah is All-Knower of everything"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"There is no sin on them (Prophet’s wives, if they appear unveiled) before their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brother’s sons, their sister’s sons, their own (believing) women, those whom their right hand possesses (their female captives), fear Allah.
