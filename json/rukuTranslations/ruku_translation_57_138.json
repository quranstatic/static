If you obey the (overt or covert) rejecters of the Divine System, they will make you turn back on your heels and you will become losers. (The Messenger will not be among you forever)"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":150,"Text":"Remember, only Allah is your MAULA (Master) and He is the Best of helpers"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":151,"Text":"Our Law removes fear and grief from the hearts of people who submit to the Divine Guidance alone. (2:38)) And causes fear in the hearts of those who are bent upon denying the Truth since they ascribe divine powers besides Allah. People and idols would have no authority against the Laws of Allah. Fire is their abode, a miserable resting place for the wrongdoers"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":152,"Text":"Allah made good His promise to you when you routed them by His leave. But then you wavered, disputed among yourselves, and disobeyed after He had shown you the victory you wanted. You were winning the battle of Uhud, but then some of you were distracted by the spoils of the world, while others were concerned with the Hereafter. You disengaged from the enemy and were tested according to His Law. When you mended, Allah pardoned you. Allah is full of Grace for the true believers"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":153,"Text":"You were climbing up the hill without looking around and the Messenger was calling you.

Allah is Informed of all your actions"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":154,"Text":"After the setback, He sent down upon you calm that pacified some of you. While another group was anxious with their own feelings and wrong assumptions about Allah due to ignorance. (They were hypocrites worried for their lives). They said, \"Do we have any control?\" Tell them, \"All control belongs to Allah.\" You can control events only within the framework of His Laws. These hypocrites concealed within themselves what they did not reveal to you. They said, \"If we had nothing to do with this battle and had stayed home we would not have been harmed.\" Say, \"Had you stayed in your homes, those destined to be killed would have crawled themselves to the circumstance of death.\" Allah thus lets you test your real convictions. Allah is Aware of what is in the hearts"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":155,"Text":"Those of you, who turned back on that day when the two armies clashed, it was their selfish desire which caused them to backslide. This happened because of their imperfections. Allah pardoned them (since their good outweighed their shortcomings). Allah is Forgiving, Forbearing"}]}
