Allah is the Powerful Appointer of His Laws. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"Allah does not forbid you from being kind, and fully equitable to those who do not fight you on account of Religion, and do not evict you from your homelands. Behold, Allah loves those who lead a just, balanced life"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"Allah only forbids you from befriending only those who fight you on account of Religion and evict you from your homelands, or help others in evicting you. Whoever befriends them, it is they, they who will be wrongdoers"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! When believing women come to you as immigrants, investigate their case, although only Allah is best Aware of their Faith. Once you establish that they are indeed believers, do not return them to the rejecters of the Truth. They are not lawful for the rejecters, nor are the rejecters lawful for them. Give the rejecters what they have spent on them (as dowry). And there is no blame on you if you marry these women, when you have given them their due marital gift. And do not hold on to wedlock with women who continue to deny the Truth. And you may ask them for the dowry you had paid, just as the rejecters have the right to ask the return of what they spent. This is the Judgment of Allah. He judges between you, for Allah is all-Knowing, all-Wise"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"If the dower of a believer's immigrant wife has gone to the disbelievers, at your turn (when a believing woman comes to you for asylum, the government will) compensate your men from what they had given (to their disbelieving wives as dower).

When believing women come unto you taking oath of allegiance to you (they shall pledge that they will) - Not associate anyone with Allah. Not steal the rights of others. Not commit immodesty. Neither kill their children, nor deprive them of good rearing. Not indulge in fabricating slander, either overtly or covertly. Not disobey you in the Qur'anic Values. When they have made the pledge, accept their allegiance and ask Allah to bestow upon them the protection of forgiveness. For, behold, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Do not befriend a people whom Allah has condemned. Of the Hereafter they are already in despair - just as the deniers of the Truth despair (the resurrection) of those who are in the graves"}]}
