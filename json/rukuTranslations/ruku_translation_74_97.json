Anyone who lacks the means to do this must fast for two consecutive months by way of repentance to God: God is all knowing, all wise"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":93,"Text":"If anyone kills a believer deliberately, the punishment for him is Hell, and there he will remain: God is angry with him, and rejects him, and has prepared a tremendous torment for him"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":94,"Text":"So, you who believe, be careful when you go to fight in God’s way, and do not say to someone who offers you a greeting of peace, ‘You are not a believer,’ out of desire for the chance gains of this life- God has plenty of gains for you. You yourself were in the same position [once], but God was gracious to you, so be careful: God is fully aware of what you do"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":95,"Text":"Those believers who stay at home, apart from those with an incapacity, are not equal to those who commit themselves and their possessions to striving in God’s way.
