And if you are people down with disease or on a journey, or one of you has come out of the toilet or you have made sexual contact with women and you find not water — then you people utilize clean clay (to soak the emissions and clean the part); then rub (with some additional clean dust) your faces and your hands (upto the wrists). Surely, Allah is Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving. [ See Note alongside]"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":44,"Text":"Have you not turned your vision to those who were given a portion from Al-Kitab?

Develop Faith in accordance with what We have revealed (as The Book rebrought in original) confirming that (already available) with you people, before We disfigure the faces, then We (also) turn them to their hindwards or curse them as We cursed the ‘people of As-Sabt’ (who did not adhere to temporary close-down of business and traffic. Thus, they were directed to take part in the weekly Institution. Mankind needs a sermon based on Allah’s Book, followed by Salat in Congregation every week). And the commandment of Allah got fulfilled (and this led to the appearance of ‘human apes’ and ‘human pigs’ as a permanent admonition)"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":48,"Text":"Verily, Allah does not forgive if partnership is associated to Him while He forgives whatever is outside it to whom He thinks proper.
