Rich or poor as they may be, Allah is He who is more capable of guarding their interests. Therefore, do not be influenced by emotion nor let the ruling passion conquer reason and sway you from justice. And if you should swerve from this course of action or turn a deaf ear, you must realize that Allah has always been ever Khabirun of all that you do"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":136,"Text":"O you who have conformed to Islam: Believe in Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, and acknowledge His Messenger and give credence to the Book He has sent down to him- the Quran- and to the Book He sent down before. And he, who denies Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Day of Resurrection, shall have erred and strayed far deep in the maze of error"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":137,"Text":"Indeed, those who conformed to Islam then turned renegades, then again conformed to Islam and again went over from Islam and sank deeply in disbelief under the unjustifiable vexations of their minds and spirit shall be undone past all retrieve whichever way they turn. Never shall Allah forgive them nor guide them to the path of righteousness"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":138,"Text":"Announce O Muhammad to the hypocrites that they must expect a condign punishment"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":139,"Text":"Those of you who take the infidels who deny Allah as intimate friends and favour their tutelage to that of their co-religionists who are of the same law, had better pause to think. Do they seek honour and power at their hands and pride themselves in so doing! But all power, omnipotence and honour rest on the helm of Allah's hands"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":140,"Text":"Allah has instructed you in the Book -the Quran- He revealed to you, thus: \"Should you happen to hear Allah's revelations challenged and denied and held up to ridicule by those who were born to be losers, then you do not keep company with them until they have changed the subject of conversation and virtue and wisdom no longer sit in want, lest you be alike.\" Allah shall gather the hypocrites and the infidels who deny Him all together in the kingdom of Hell"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":141,"Text":"Such persons are they who watch you closely and they are on the watch for opportunities. If Allah graces you with His tutelage and victory sits on your helm, they desire with expectation to share the credit and they interpret their thoughts in words; they say to you: \"Have we not been on your side!\" And if the infidels who deny Allah are befallen with good fortune they say to them: \"Did we not back you up and avert the disaster which would have befallen you at the hands of the Muslims?\" Allah shall judge between you on the Day of Resurrection and Judgement and never shall Allah advantage the cause of the infidels over that of the Muslims"}]}
