What We have revealed to you are the same commandments as We gave to (the messengers) Ibraheem, Musa and Jesus: (namely) to establish the faith and not (disunite and) splinter into sects. (Oh Muhammad, SAW), what you are calling them towards _ (the worship of the One true god, Allah) _ is too burdensome to bear for those accepting other gods beside Him. Allah selects whom He wants, and guides along His path the one who turns to Him (in repentance)"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"But they splintered into groups even though (divine) knowledge had already come to them, because they wished to (encroach upon and) violate each other´s rights.

He supplies (ample) provisions to whom He wants; He is the Mighty and the Powerful"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":20,"Text":"We multiply the benefits for those who want to reap the worth (of their deeds) in the afterlife.
