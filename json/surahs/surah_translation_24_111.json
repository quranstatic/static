[Please note that in the law of evidence there is no difference between a male and a female. Rather, when both give identical evidence the punishment gets averted from the female — indicating that the evidence given by her has more credence and it prevails over the evidence given by her husband. Also note that ‘curse of Allah’ has been mentioned to warn the male, while much milder phrase ‘wrath of Allah’ has been used to warn the female. And the most important point evident and manifest over here is that the word Azaab in Verse No. 2 and Verse No. 8 refers to one and the same punishment — ‘to flog one hundred stripes in public.’ Allah’s Book makes no distinction between a married and an unmarried person, or between a male and a female regarding this punishment. No punishment, other than flogging, is mentioned for Zina anywhere, throughout the Text of Al-Kitab. We must now ponder as to why Allah placed the first verse in this Surah which acts as a pre-amble as well as a warning. Allah, the All-Knowing and All-Aware knew beforehand that books written and produced by humans would attempt to override the ordainments of the Book of Allah and create confusion about the law of punishment applicable to Zina]"},{"SurahNumber":24,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"And if (there is) not the Grace of Allah over you, and His Mercy (you would be disturbing your marital lives and breahead of state up your families without reason) — and that Allah is the One Who accepts repentance, the All-Wise"},{"SurahNumber":24,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Verily, those who came forward with the slander (a false charge against a chaste personality) are a small group out of you people.

[This verse gives a start to the directions and admonitions to control and regulate the behaviour of the society. This counselling continues in many verses that follow. The wordings in this verse indicate that the incident of slander was cooked up on the basis of something which was noticed and misunderstood when a person entered in a house out of a sudden, without ashead of state permission of the inmates.
