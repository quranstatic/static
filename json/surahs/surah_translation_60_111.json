Pick up not My enemies and your enemies as auliya; you approach them with affection while indeed they have disbelieved in what came to you of Al-Haqq. They drive out the Messenger as well as you (Muslims) since you Believe in Allah — Nourisher-Sustainer to you. If you happened: you moved out striving in My Cause, and seehead of state My agreements — (yet) you secretly move towards them with affection, and I do know with what you kept secret, and what you made evident.

We have rejected you and there has started between us and between you hostility and hatred for ever — until you develop Faith in Allah — in His Oneness— excluding the statement of Ibrahim regarding his father: 'Surely, I will ask for forgiveness (from Allah) for you', although I do not own any thing from Allah for your benefit.

And compensate them what these (disbelieving husbands) have spent (as bridal money on these women). And there is no blame on you that you bind in Nikah (wedlock) those women (although no divorce has been pronounced by their previous husbands) when you have paid those women their bridal-money (ujoor or Mahr). Likewise do not continue the links of wedlock of the disbelieving women. And you should demand what you spent (on such women as bridal-money); and let those (disbelieving husbands like wise) ask (as demand) what they have spent (on those women who have reverted to Islam and have deserted them).
