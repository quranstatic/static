You will not be blamed if you make a mistake, only for what your hearts deliberately intend; God is most forgiving and merciful"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"The Prophet is more protective towards the believers than they are themselves, while his wives are their mothers. In God’s Scripture, blood-relatives have a stronger claim than other believers and emigrants, though you may still bestow gifts on your proteges. All this is written in the Scripture"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"We took a solemn pledge from the prophets- from you [Muhammad], from Noah, from Abraham, from Moses, from Jesus, son of Mary- We took a solemn pledge from all of them"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"God will question [even] the truthful about their sincerity, and for those who reject the truth He has prepared a painful torment"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"You who believe, remember God’s goodness to you when mighty armies massed against you: We sent a violent wind and invisible forces against them.

When you are invited, go in; then, when you have taken your meal, leave. Do not stay on and talk, for that would offend the Prophet, though he would shrink from asking you to leave. God does not shrink from the truth. When you ask his wives for something, do so from behind a screen: this is purer both for your hearts and for theirs. It is not right for you to offend God’s Messenger, just as you should never marry his wives after him: that would be grievous in God’s eyes"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"God has full knowledge of all things, whether you reveal them or not"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"The Prophet’s wives are not to blame [if they are seen by] their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers’ sons, their sisters’ sons, their women, or their slaves.
