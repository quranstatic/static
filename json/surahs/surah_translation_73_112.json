And God ordains the nighttime and the daytime. He knew that you would not be able to keep count of it, so He turned towards you in forgiveness, then recite of the Quran as much as was easy. He knew that some of you are sick and others travel on the earth looking for the grace of God and others fight in the way of God. So recite of it as much as was easy. And perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms and lend to God a fairer loan. For whatever of good you put forward for your souls, you will find the same with God. It is good and a sublime compensation. And ask God for forgiveness. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate"}]}
