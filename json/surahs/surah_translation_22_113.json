Fear your Lord! Indeed, the jolt of that hour (of Judgment) is a terrible thing"},{"SurahNumber":22,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"On that day _ (the Day of Judgment) _ you will see every breast feeding mother oblivious of her suckling infant! Every pregnant female would abort her fetus! And people would appear to be drunk although they would not be drunk! The punishment of Allah would indeed be that severe"},{"SurahNumber":22,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Some people argue about Allah, although they have no knowledge. They tag along every defiant Shaitan"},{"SurahNumber":22,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"About whom it has been decreed, that he will lead astray anyone who abides by him, and that he will steer his flock straight into the torment of hellfire"},{"SurahNumber":22,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"Oh you people! Should you be in doubt about the resurrection, consider this: it is We Who created you (first) from dust and then (in stages) from semen to a clinging clot of blood, and then to a small chunk of flesh _ formed as well as unformed. (We tell you this) in order to explain to you the truth. In the womb, We keep installed whomever We want for a fixed time. Then, We bring you out as an infant, and let you obtain your full potential. Some of you die young while others are diverted to the age of weakness (and senility) _ the age when (once again) they know nothing after having learnt a few things. You observe the land dry and barren. Then, as soon as We send rain water down (it comes alive), it stirs, swells up and starts producing all sorts of delightful vegetation"},{"SurahNumber":22,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"That is so because Allah is the absolute Reality! And because He grants life back to the dead!

They lose out in this world, and also in the next! That, surely is a real loss"},{"SurahNumber":22,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"Instead of Allah, they pray to such deities that can inflict no harm, and award no benefits. That is surely the worst kind of misguidance"},{"SurahNumber":22,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"They pray to the one whose harm outweighs the benefits.

Undoubtedly, Allah does what He wills"},{"SurahNumber":22,"VerseNumber":19,"Text":"These are the two rival groups _ (those who prostrate before Allah, and those who do not).

So, shun the filth of idolatry and steer clear of the false statement"},{"SurahNumber":22,"VerseNumber":31,"Text":"(Forsaking all else and) without ascribing partners to Him, be a true believer in Allah.
