It has 286 verses divided in 40 sections. This Surah was revealed in Madinah. The Surah deals with a number of issues related to beliefs, history, law and morality. The Surah begins with the statement that it is Allah who revealed this book (the Qur'an) for the guidance of those who are conscious of Allah. Only those who seek guidance can benefit from the guidance of this Book. There are three types of human beings:</p>","<ol>","\t<li>Those who believe in the unseen realities, perform prayers, give part of their wealth in charity, believe in what is revealed in this scripture and what was revealed before to other prophets and messengers of Allah. These are the true believers. They shall benefit from this book and they shall be eternally successful.</li>","\t<li>Second group consists of those who have decided to reject Allah's message. They are the Kafirs. Since they have made up their minds to reject Islam, no preaching will help them. Allah will punish them on the Day of Judgment because of their rejection.</li>","\t<li>Third is the group of people who say that they have believed, but actually they have not believed. They try to be on both sides: sometimes at the side of faith and sometimes at the side of unfaith. They are the hypocrites. They may think that in this way they will gain both sides, but in reality they are also the losers.</li>","</ol>","<p>All people are invited to worship Allah and to become His true servants. Allah created all people and He made the earth and heaven for their benefit and produced sustenance for them. The problem comes when people deny their Creator, break the relations that Allah told them to keep, follow the wrong ways in life and make mischief in the land.</p>","<p>The story of the creation of human beings is told. Allah created Adam. He gave him knowledge, asked angels to bow to him and gave him and his wife the garden of bliss to reside and enjoy its fruits. He told them to eat whatever they wished, but not to approach one tree. But Satan caused Adam to lose paradise. Allah sent Adam and his wife to earth and told them that they must remember the lesson that they learnt in the Paradise: They need God's guidance. Satan is their biggest enemy. Those who will obey Allah on this earth will return to Paradise, but those who will obey Satan may end up in hell.</p>","<p>Allah's covenant with the children of Israel is mentioned. It is mentioned that those who receive Allah's covenant they must live by it. Allah blessed those who fulfill their promise with Him. Prophet Ibrahim's prayer, Ka'bah's importance and the coming of Prophet Muhammad is also mentioned. The command to change the direction of prayer from Jerusalem to Ka'bah to emphasize the final covenant of Allah with Prophet Muhammad and his followers. The Surah also speaks about basic beliefs, acts of worship, economic dealings, moral and manners. The rules of marriage, divorce and 'iddah are mentioned. The Surah has discussed many subjects. Following the outline of the sections of this Surah.</p>","<ol>","\t<li>The Book of Guidance for those who want to be righteous. The difference between the believers and the non-believers.</li>","\t<li>The hypocrites: their sickness, mischief and self-deception.</li>","\t<li>Mankind, worship Allah alone. Make no partners in Allah's divinity. The challenge of the Qur’an. This Book will guide many but many will remain in error. The character of those who shall remain in error.</li>","\t<li>The story of the creation of Adam. Allah’s plan and promise to send His guidance from time to time through His prophets.</li>","\t<li>Address to Bani Israel to accept this message.

The hesitation of Bani Israel in sacrificing the cow.</li>","\t<li>Some perversions of those who were supposed to follow the law of God.</li>","\t<li>Basic principles of God’s Covenant with the Children of Israel.</li>","\t<li>Some of them were arrogant to follow the teachings of their prophets, some rejected the prophets or tried to kill them, some worshipped the calf, disobeyed God’s commands and became too greedy for the life of this world.</li>","\t<li>Opposition and enmity towards the Prophets, following devils and magic.</li>","\t<li>Reminders to the Believers to follow these examples. Stay firm on your principles. Some among the People of the Book will try to mislead you with false claims and assertions.</li>","\t<li>The true guidance of Allah is here. Read the Book of Allah and follow it.</li>","\t<li>The great example of Prophet Ibrahim –peace be upon him. He and his son built the Ka’bah and prayed for a Prophet to come.</li>","\t<li>Prophet Ibrahim –peace be upon him- submitted to Allah and this is the message that he and his sons gave to their progeny.</li>","\t<li>The change of Qiblah and the response of the hypocrites and fools. Those who have knowledge know that this is the true Qiblah of all the Prophets.</li>","\t<li>Follow this direction wherever you are. This is the universal Qiblah for all.</li>","\t<li>Believers will be tried but they should be firm and steadfast and must face the trials with patience and prayers.</li>","\t<li>Allah’s signs and His bounties are everywhere.

To Allah belong everything. His Throne extends to heaven and earth. No compulsion in religion. Allah brings out people from darkness unto light.</li>","\t<li>Allah’s power over life and death, some examples: Prophet Ibrahim’s dialogue with Namrood, a man in the valley of dead (probably Prophet Ezekiel’s vision of Jerusalem), Prophet Ibrahim asks Allah how will He raise the dead to life.
