Adam was the first human being, the first prophet, and the father of\r\n        humanity. His story begins with his creation by Allah, the Almighty, and continues through his life in Paradise,\r\n        his descent to Earth, his role as a prophet, and his eventual death.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Divine Intention to Create Adam</h2>\r\n    <p>Before the creation of Adam, Allah announced His intention to the angels to create a being that would serve as\r\n        His representative or <em>vicegerent</em> (<strong>khalifah</strong>) on Earth. The angels, who had witnessed\r\n        previous creatures causing corruption and bloodshed on Earth, expressed concern about the wisdom of such a\r\n        decision:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And when your Lord said to the angels, 'Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority.'\r\n        They said, 'Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your\r\n        praise and sanctify You?' Allah said, 'Indeed, I know that which you do not know.'\"<br> (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:30)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <p>Despite their concerns, the angels trusted Allah’s wisdom and waited to witness the unfolding of His plan. Allah\r\n        intended to create a new being, one with free will, capable of making choices and bearing the responsibility for\r\n        those choices.</p>\r\n    <p>We imagine when Allah the Almighty decided to create Adam: He addressed His angels and told them to prostrate\r\n        before him. He did not mean to ask their opinion or take their advice, for He is above that. Allah the Exalted\r\n        told them that He was going to create a vicegerent on the earth who would have children and grandchildren who\r\n        would corrupt the earth and shed each other's blood. That is why the angels said to Allah the Almighty: \"Will\r\n        You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood!\" (Surah 2:30 Quran).</p>\r\n    <p>There are old traditions about the angels before the creation of Adam. According to Ibn Qatadah, it was said that\r\n        the angels were informed about the creation of Adam and his progency by the jinn who lived before Adam. Abdullah\r\n        Ibn Umar said that the jinn had existed for about 2000 years before Adam and then shed blood. Therefore Allah\r\n        sent on them an army of angels that drove them out to the depths of the seas.</p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Abi Hatim narrated from Ali jafar Al Baqer that the angels were informed that man would cause wickedness and\r\n        shed blood on earth. It was also said that they knew that no one would be created on earth who would not be\r\n        wicked and shed blood. Whether or not these traditions are correct, the angels did understand that Allah would\r\n        create a\r\n        vicegerent on earth. Allah the Almighty announced that HE was going to create a human being out of clay, that HE\r\n        would mold him and blow His spirit into him and then the angels should prostrate before him.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Creation of Adam</h2>\r\n    <p>Allah created Adam from <strong>clay</strong> or <strong>dust</strong> gathered from various parts of the Earth.\r\n        This clay was shaped and molded into the form of a human, and Allah left it for a time before breathing life\r\n        into it. Abi Musa al Sha'arai narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: \"Allah created Adam\r\n        from a handful of dust taken from different lands, so the children of Adam have been created according to the\r\n        composition of the land. Therefore from mankind we have white, red, black and yellow ones; we have good and\r\n        evil, ease and sorrow, and\r\n        what comes in between them.\" (Sahih al Bukhari). The Qur'an describes this process of creation in several\r\n        verses:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"He created him from dust, then He said to him, 'Be,' and he was.\"<br> (Surah Aal-E-Imran, 3:59)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And indeed, We created man from sounding clay, from molded mud.\"<br> (Surah Al-Hijr, 15:26)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Truly, I am going to create man from clay. So when I have fashioned him and breathed into him\r\n        (his) soul created by Me, then you fall down prostrate to him.\" (Surah 38:71-72).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>So Allah shaped Adam into a human being, but he remained a figure of clay for fourty years. The\r\n        angels went past him. They were seized with fear by what they saw, and Iblis felt fear most. He\r\n        used to pass by the figure of Adam, buffeting it, which would make a sound like pottery. Allah\r\n        told us:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"He created man (Adam) from sounding clay like the clay of pottery.\" (Surah 55).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>When the time drew near to breathe the spirit into Adam, as Allah decreed, He commanded the\r\n        angels: \"When I breathe My spirit into him prostrate before him.\" Allah breathed His spirit into\r\n        Adam and when it reached his head Adam sneezed. The angels said: \"Say all praise belongs to\r\n        Allah.\" Adam repeated: \"All praise belongs to Allah.\" Allah said to him: \"Your Lord has granted\r\n        you mercy.\" When the spirit reached his eyes, Adam looked at the fruits of Paradise. When it\r\n        reached his abdomen Adam felt an appetite for food. He jumped hurriedly before the spirit could\r\n        reach his legs, so that he could eat from the fruits of Paradise. Allah, therefore, said:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Man is created of haste.\" (Surah Al-Anbiya, 21:37).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>And then:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"The angels prostrated themselves all of them together. Except Iblis, he refused to be among the\r\n        prostrators. (Surah 15:31-32).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Iblis, a jinn who had been given the honor of residing among the angels due to his devotion, witnessed the\r\n        creation of Adam. He passed by the lifeless form of Adam and struck it, producing a hollow sound. Iblis\r\n        immediately sensed that this new creation, made from clay, was inferior to his own creation from fire. This\r\n        belief would later lead to his rebellion.</p>\r\n    <p>Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: \"Allah created Adam from dust\r\n        after He mixed the clay and left him for some time until it became sticky mud, after which Allah\r\n        shaped him. After that Allah left him till it became like potter's clay. Iblis used to go past him\r\n        saying 'You have been created for a great purpose.' After that Allah breathed His spirit into him.\r\n        The first thing into which the spirit passed was his eye and then his nose. He sneezed. Allah said:\r\n        \"May your Lord have mercy upon you, O Adam! Go to those angels and see what they would\r\n        say.' So Adam went and greeted them. they replied saying: \"Peace be upon you and the mercy and\r\n        blessings of Allah.\" Allah said: \"O Adam! This is your greeting and that of your offspring.\" (Sahih\r\n        al Bukhari).</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Adam’s Knowledge and His Superiority</h2>\r\n    <p>After creating Adam, Allah bestowed upon him the gift of <strong>knowledge</strong>. Allah taught Adam the\r\n        <strong>names of all things</strong>, a symbol of his capacity for knowledge, understanding, and intellect. The\r\n        knowledge given to Adam was so vast that the angels, who had questioned his creation, could not comprehend it.\r\n        Allah demonstrated Adam’s superiority by asking the angels to name the objects He had taught Adam:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And He taught Adam the names—all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, 'Inform Me of the\r\n        names of these, if you are truthful.' They said, 'Exalted are You; we have no knowledge except what You have\r\n        taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing, the Wise.'\" <br>(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:31-32)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>When the angels admitted their limitations, Adam was called upon to recite the names. He did so successfully, and\r\n        Allah declared to the angels:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth? And I know what you\r\n        reveal and what you have concealed.\" <br>(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:33)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Through this act, Adam’s status was elevated, and it was made clear that his knowledge was a key component of his\r\n        role as Allah’s vicegerent on Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Command to Prostrate to Adam</h2>\r\n    <p>In recognition of Adam’s status and the special knowledge given to him, Allah commanded all the angels to\r\n        <strong>prostrate</strong> to Adam as a sign of respect and honor:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And [mention] when We said to the angels, 'Prostrate before Adam'; so they prostrated, except for\r\n        Iblis. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers.\" <br>(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:34)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>All the angels obeyed the command of Allah, except for Iblis, who was not an angel but a jinn. Iblis’s refusal\r\n        was driven by his arrogance and jealousy. He considered himself superior because he was made from fire, while\r\n        Adam was made from clay:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay.\" <br>(Surah Al-A'raf, 7:12)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <p>Because of his disobedience, Iblis was cast out of Paradise and became accursed. However, before leaving, Iblis\r\n        requested respite until the Day of Judgment, vowing to mislead Adam’s descendants:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"He said, 'My Lord, because You have put me in error, I will surely sit in wait for them on Your\r\n        straight path. Then I will come to them from before them and from behind them and on their right and on their\r\n        left, and You will not find most of them grateful [to You].'\" <br>(Surah Al-A'raf, 7:16-17)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Allah granted Iblis this respite but warned that those who followed Allah’s guidance would remain protected from\r\n        Iblis’s deceit.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Creation of Hawwa (Eve)</h2>\r\n    <p>Allah, in His wisdom, saw that Adam needed companionship. Therefore, He created a partner for him, <strong>Hawwa\r\n            (Eve)</strong>, from one of Adam’s ribs. The creation of Hawwa from Adam symbolizes the deep connection and\r\n        bond between man and woman. Together, Adam and Hawwa lived in the bliss of Paradise, where they enjoyed all its\r\n        bounties except for one prohibition:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And We said, 'O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance\r\n        from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.'\" <br>(Surah\r\n        Al-Baqarah, 2:35)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"O Mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam) and from\r\n        Him (Adam) He created his wife (Eve), and from them both He created many men and women.\r\n        (Surah 4:1)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"It is he Who has created you from a single person (Adam) and then He created from him his\r\n        wife (Eve), in order that he might enjoy the pleasure of living with her.\"(Surah 7:189).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Establishing the Islamic Greeting</h2>\r\n    <p>Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: \"O Muslims! I advise you to be\r\n        gentle with women, for they are created from a rib, and the most crooked portion of the rib is its\r\n        upper part. If you try to straighten it, it will break and if you leave it, it will remain crooked, so I\r\n        urge you to take care of the women.\" (Sahih Bukhari). Allah commanded Adam to dwell in Paradise:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise\r\n        and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight of things therein as wherever you will, but\r\n        come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimeen (wrong doers).\"(Surah 2:35)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Location of Adam and Eve's Paradise</h2>\r\n    <p>The location of this Paradise is unknown to us. The Quran did not reveal it, and the commentators\r\n        had five different opinions. Some said that it was the paradise of our refuge and that its place was\r\n        heaven. Others regreted that statement because if it was the paradise of refuge Iblis would have\r\n        been forbidden admission and disobedience would have been forbidden as well. Still others said\r\n        that it was another paradise that was created by Allah for Adam and Eve. A fourth group said it\r\n        was a paradise on the earth located in a high place. Another group of commentators accept what\r\n        was in the Quran without questioning where this paradise was located. We agree with this last\r\n        opinion as the lesson we learn from its location is immaterial compared to the lesson we learn\r\n        from the events that took place there.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Allah's Warning to Adam and Eve</h2>\r\n    <p>Adam and eve were admitted to Paradise and there they lived the dream of all human beings.\r\n        Allah permitted them to approach and enjoy everything except one tree, that might have been the\r\n        Tree of Pain or the Tree of Knowledge. Allah forbade them they were give abode in Paradise.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"But come not near this tree or you both will be of the wrong doers.\" (Surah 2:35)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Iblis’s Deception and the Fall of Adam and Hawwa</h2>\r\n    <p>Adam and Eve understood that they were forbidden to eat the fruit of that tree. Adam was\r\n        however a human being and man tends to forget. His heart changes and his will weakens. Iblis\r\n        summoned all the envy within him and took advantage of Adam's humanity to exploit him. Iblis, now banished and\r\n        full of envy and hatred for Adam and his descendants, plotted to deceive Adam and Hawwa.\r\n        He approached them and whispered temptations, suggesting that eating from the forbidden tree would grant them\r\n        immortality and eternal life:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Your Lord did not forbid you this tree save you should become angels or become of the\r\n        immortals.\" He (Satan) swore by Allah to them both saying: \"Verily I am one of the sincere well\r\n        wishers for you both.\" (Surah 7:20-21)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Despite Allah’s clear command, Adam and Hawwa were deceived by Iblis’s false promises and ate from the forbidden\r\n        tree. Upon realizing their error, their innocence was lost, and they became aware of their nakedness, hastily\r\n        covering themselves with leaves.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"So he (Satan) misled them with deception.\" (Surah 7:22)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Thus did Adam disobey his Lord so he went astray.\" (Surah 20:121).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Adam and Hawwa’s Repentance</h2>\r\n    <p>After their disobedience, Adam and Hawwa were filled with regret and sought Allah’s forgiveness. They recognized\r\n        their mistake and turned to Allah in sincere repentance:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you: Verily Satan is an open enemy unto you?\" They said:\r\n        \"Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your\r\n        Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers.\" Allah said; \"Get down, one of you an enemy to the\r\n        other (Adam, Eve, and Satan etc). On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment,\r\n        for a time.\" He said: \"Therein you shall live and therein you shall die, and from it you shall be\r\n        brought out (resurrected).\" (Surah 7:22-25).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Allah, in His infinite mercy, accepted their repentance but decreed that they, along with their descendants,\r\n        would live on Earth, where they would face trials, hardship, and the constant temptations of Iblis. However,\r\n        Allah also promised guidance to humanity through His prophets, so that those who followed the guidance would be\r\n        saved:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"We said, 'Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My\r\n        guidance—there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.'\" <br>(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:38)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Life on Earth</h2>\r\n    <p>Adam and Hawwa began their life on Earth, where they had children. Among their sons were <strong>Habil\r\n            (Abel)</strong> and <strong>Qabil (Cain)</strong>. As they grew, the two brothers were commanded to offer\r\n        sacrifices to Allah. Habil’s offering was accepted by Allah, but Qabil’s was not. Out of jealousy and envy,\r\n        Qabil plotted against his brother, leading to the first murder in human history:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And his soul permitted to him the murder of his brother, so he killed him and became among the losers.\"\r\n        <br>(Surah Al-Ma’idah, 5:30)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <p>Qabil’s crime grieved Adam deeply, marking a tragic moment in the early history of humankind. It also highlighted\r\n        the destructive potential of jealousy and arrogance, qualities that had already been demonstrated by Iblis.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Adam’s Role as the First Prophet</h2>\r\n    <p>Despite the trials and difficulties, Adam remained steadfast in his devotion to Allah. As the first prophet, he\r\n        taught his children about their Creator, guiding them on the path of righteousness and warning them against the\r\n        deceptions of Iblis. Adam’s teachings laid the foundation for the moral and spiritual guidance that would be\r\n        delivered by future prophets, including Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (peace be upon them all).</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Death of Prophet Adam</h2>\r\n    <p>According to Islamic tradition, Prophet Adam lived for approximately <strong>1,000 years</strong>. As his time on\r\n        Earth came to an end, Allah sent the angels to take his soul. Before his death, Adam appointed his son\r\n        <strong>Seth (Sheeth)</strong> as his successor, instructing him to continue guiding humanity according to\r\n        Allah’s will.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>The angels came to Adam and gently took his soul. His children buried him, marking the first funeral rites in\r\n        human history. The burial of Adam was a profound moment, as it symbolized the return of humanity to the Earth\r\n        from which they were created, and it established the tradition of honoring the dead.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Legacy of Prophet Adam</h2>\r\n    <p>The story of Prophet Adam (peace be upon him) is a powerful reminder of the dignity and honor bestowed upon\r\n        humanity by Allah. It teaches us about the importance of knowledge, the consequences of disobedience, and the\r\n        mercy of Allah in accepting repentance. Adam’s life serves as an example for all of humanity, illustrating both\r\n        the potential for greatness and the pitfalls of arrogance and envy.</p>\r\n    <p>Prophet Adam’s legacy is one of resilience, repentance, and the continuous pursuit of Allah’s guidance. His story\r\n        is a timeless reminder that, despite our human imperfections, we can always turn to Allah for forgiveness and\r\n        mercy, and that following divine guidance is the path to success in this life and the hereafter.</p>\r\n</body>"},{"Id":2,"LanguageCode":"en","TranslatedName":"Seth","ArabicName":"شيث","ArabicTransliteratedName":"Sheth","AudioFileName":null,"SourceHtml":"<body>\r\n    <p><strong>Prophet Sheth (Seth, peace be upon him)</strong> was the third son of Prophet Adam (peace be upon him) and Hawwa (Eve). His name, \"Sheth,\" comes from a Hebrew word meaning \"granted\" or \"appointed,\" because he was regarded as a gift and a blessing to Adam and Hawwa after the tragedy of the loss of their son Habil (Abel) at the hands of his brother Qabil (Cain).</p>\r\n    <p>In Islamic tradition, Prophet Sheth is not only considered a righteous son of Adam but also a prophet chosen by Allah to continue the guidance of humankind after the death of Adam. He played a pivotal role in carrying forward the legacy of moral and spiritual instruction that his father began.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Birth of Sheth</h2>\r\n    <p>After the murder of Habil, Adam and Hawwa were devastated by the loss of their righteous son. They prayed earnestly for Allah to bless them with another child who would be a righteous successor to Habil. Allah answered their prayers by granting them Sheth. He was born after the death of Habil, and his birth brought much solace and comfort to his parents, as he was known for his piety and righteousness from a very early age.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Sheth as a Prophet</h2>\r\n    <p>Before Adam’s death, he appointed Sheth as his successor, entrusting him with the responsibility of guiding his descendants and maintaining the teachings of monotheism. Islamic scholars, such as Ibn Kathir, narrate that Sheth was given the responsibility of governing the affairs of the righteous people who lived among Adam’s progeny.</p>\r\n    <p>Sheth was not only tasked with governance but was also given a set of divine laws by Allah, marking him as a prophet. These laws helped to distinguish the righteous followers of Sheth from those who strayed into disobedience and corruption. Ibn Kathir mentions that Sheth was the first to receive divine revelations in the form of <strong>scripture</strong>, although the exact nature and content of these revelations are not described in great detail in Islamic sources.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"It is said that fifty scriptures were revealed to Sheth.\"<br> (Ibn Kathir)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Role of Sheth After Adam’s Death</h2>\r\n    <p>After Adam’s death, Sheth assumed leadership over Adam’s descendants. His people followed the pure and righteous path laid down by his father, worshipping Allah alone and living in harmony. Sheth, like Adam, instructed his people in matters of faith, morality, and governance, ensuring that the community remained united and obedient to Allah.</p>\r\n    <p>Sheth’s role as a prophet also included guiding his people to avoid the pitfalls of sin and the temptations that would later arise, especially from those who followed the path of Qabil. The followers of Qabil had distanced themselves from Sheth’s righteous community, indulging in immoral and corrupt behavior. Over time, this distinction between the righteous and the corrupt became more pronounced.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Division of Adam’s Descendants</h2>\r\n    <p>After Qabil’s crime, he and his descendants became a separate group from the rest of Adam’s family. They lived in isolation, often in the mountains or other remote areas, far from the righteous followers of Sheth. The two groups developed distinct lifestyles. The people of Qabil became known for their disobedience to Allah, engaging in sinful behavior and neglecting the divine teachings.</p>\r\n    <p>The followers of Sheth, on the other hand, were steadfast in their worship and obedience to Allah. They lived simple, pure lives and adhered to the divine guidance passed down from Adam to Sheth. The community of Sheth was marked by peace, cooperation, and a strong sense of spirituality. They were warned against associating with the followers of Qabil, who represented the dangers of sin and transgression.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Corruption of Qabil’s Descendants</h2>\r\n    <p>Over time, the descendants of Qabil began to increase in number and grow more corrupt. They indulged in music, dancing, and other forms of entertainment that distracted them from the worship of Allah. Their immorality became so widespread that it started to influence those around them. The people of Sheth were warned not to interact with the followers of Qabil, but eventually, some of Sheth’s descendants were tempted by their ways.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Do not mix with them, for their influence will corrupt your righteous nature.\"</blockquote>\r\n    <p>This warning was significant because it underscored the importance of maintaining purity in faith and actions. Sheth’s descendants were initially pious and obedient to Allah’s commandments, but as time passed, their exposure to Qabil’s corrupt descendants led some of them astray. This gradual moral decline among Sheth’s people eventually laid the groundwork for future prophets, such as <strong>Prophet Nuh (Noah, peace be upon him)</strong>, to be sent to guide humankind back to the right path.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Sheth’s Contributions to Civilization</h2>\r\n    <p>Islamic tradition credits Prophet Sheth with several important contributions to early human civilization. These include advances in agriculture, social organization, and spiritual practices. Sheth is said to have built upon the foundations established by his father, Adam, and further developed the skills and knowledge that would benefit his community.</p>\r\n    <p>Some scholars believe that Sheth introduced forms of worship and ritual that helped strengthen the bond between his people and Allah. Additionally, it is believed that Sheth contributed to the preservation of the divine wisdom passed down from Adam, ensuring that future generations would have access to the knowledge of their Creator.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Death of Prophet Sheth</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Sheth lived a long life, dedicated to guiding his people and upholding the teachings of monotheism. Before his death, he appointed his son, <strong>Enosh (Anoush)</strong>, as his successor, ensuring that the chain of prophethood would continue. According to some traditions, Sheth was buried beside his father, Adam, in a location believed to be on a mountain close to where Adam was laid to rest.</p>\r\n    <p>With Sheth’s passing, the need for continued guidance became even more critical, as the divide between righteousness and corruption grew. His life and legacy set the stage for the eventual arrival of other prophets, such as Nuh, who would continue the mission of guiding humanity back to Allah’s path.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Legacy of Prophet Sheth</h2>\r\n    <p>The story of Prophet Sheth (peace be upon him) serves as an essential chapter in the early history of humanity.

Known for his wisdom, piety, and unique end of life, Idris is considered one of the early prophets sent by Allah to guide humanity. His story is notable for its emphasis on knowledge, righteousness, and the unique honor bestowed upon him by Allah. Allah has praised Enoch, describing him as being a prophet and truthful:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Mention in the Book (Quran) Idris (Enoch). Verily! He was a man of truth (and) a prophet. We raised him to a high station\". (Surah 19:56-57).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Lineage and Early Life</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Idris is a descendant of Prophet Sheth (peace be upon him) and comes from a lineage that has a long tradition of prophetic guidance. He was born into a time when his people were in need of divine instruction and correction, as they had deviated from the true path.</p>\r\n    <p>Enoch was born and raised in Babylon following the teachings and religion of Prophet Adam\r\n        (pbuh) and his son Seth (pbuh). Enoch was the 5th generation of the Prophet Adam. He called the\r\n        people back to his forefathers religion, but only a few listened to him, while the majority turned\r\n        away.</p>\r\n    <p>Idris's early life was marked by exceptional character and wisdom.

There he carried on his mission, calling\r\n        people to what is just and fair, teaching them certain prayers and instructing them to fast on\r\n        certain days and to give a portion of their wealth to the poor.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Prophethood and Mission</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Idris was chosen by Allah to serve as a prophet at a time when the moral and spiritual state of his people was in decline. His mission was to call them back to the worship of the One True God and to guide them in living a righteous and just life.</p>\r\n    <p>Idris’s prophethood was marked by his emphasis on the principles of monotheism, justice, and the importance of adhering to divine commandments. His teachings were aimed at correcting the moral deviations and restoring the purity of faith among his people.</p>\r\n    <p>One of Idris’s notable contributions was his introduction of various forms of knowledge and civilization. He is believed to have been among the first to use writing as a means of recording knowledge and preserving divine revelations. Additionally, he is credited with advancements in areas such as mathematics and astronomy:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And We gave him the Book and the Wisdom, and We raised him up to a high station.\" <br>(Surah An-Nisa, 4:54)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Idris’s teachings were not only spiritual but also practical, contributing to the development of societal structures and intellectual pursuits that benefited his community.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Idris’s Teachings and Legacy</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Idris’s teachings emphasized the importance of knowledge, both spiritual and worldly.

His story, detailed in several places in the Quran, represents the struggle between good and evil, faith and disbelief. Nuh’s mission to guide his people and the eventual Divine judgment that befell them highlight his unwavering dedication and the consequences of rejecting Allah's message.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Lineage and Early Life</h4>\r\n    <p>Prophet Nuh’s lineage is traced back to Prophet Idris (peace be upon him) and Prophet Adam (peace be upon him). He was born into a community that had increasingly turned away from the worship of Allah and begun to indulge in idolatry. As the descendants of Adam grew, many forgot the guidance that had been passed down from earlier prophets. Instead of worshiping Allah alone, they started to create idols, seeking blessings and assistance from these false gods. They\r\n        believed that these gods would bring them good, protect them from evil and provide all their\r\n        needs. They gave their idols names such as Waddan, Suwa'an, Yaghutha, Ya'auga, and Nasran,\r\n        (These idols represented, respectively, manly power; mutability, beauty; brute strength, swiftness,\r\n        sharp sight, insight) according to the power they thought these gods possessed.</p>\r\n        <p>Originally these were the names of good people who had lived among them. After their deaths,\r\n            statues of them were erected to keep their memories alive. After sometime, however, people\r\n            began to worship these statues. Later generations did not even know why they had been erected;\r\n            they only knew their parents had prayed to them. That is how idol worshipping developed. Since\r\n            they had no understanding of Allah the Almighty Who would punish them for their evil deeds,\r\n            they became cruel and immoral. Allah the Almighty revealed:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Indeed, We sent Nuh to his people, saying, 'Warn your people before there comes to them a painful punishment.'\" <br>(Surah Nuh, 71:1)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>It was in this environment of corruption and disbelief that Allah chose Nuh to guide his people back to the path of righteousness and monotheism. Nuh was known for his integrity, piety, and devotion, even before his prophethood, making him a respected figure in his community.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Prophethood and the Call to Monotheism</h4>\r\n    <p>Prophet Nuh was given a monumental task: to call his people back to the worship of Allah and abandon the false gods they had created. His message was simple yet profound: there is no god but Allah, and it is He who created them, sustains them, and controls everything in the heavens and the earth. Nuh urged his people to repent for their sins and warned them of Allah’s punishment if they continued in their ways.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"He said, 'O my people, indeed I am to you a clear warner. Worship Allah, fear Him, and obey me. He will forgive you of your sins and delay your death for a specified term. Indeed, the time set by Allah, when it comes, will not be delayed, if you only knew.'\" <br>(Surah Nuh, 71:2-4)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>For over 950 years, Nuh persisted in delivering his message, demonstrating an extraordinary degree of patience and resilience. He employed various methods to reach his people: speaking to them publicly, conversing with them privately, and using reason and compassion to guide them. Despite his relentless efforts, only a small number of people responded to his call. Most mocked him and rejected his message, accusing him of being deluded.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"They (idolaters) have said: \"You shall not leave your gods nor shall you leave Wadd, nor\r\n        Suwa, nor Yaghuth, nor Ya uq nor Nasr (names of the idols).\" (Surah 71:23).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Various Hadith describing the Origin of Idolatry</h4>\r\n    <p>Ibn Abbas explained: \"Following upon the death of those righteous men, Satan inspired their\r\n        people to erect statues in the places where they used to sit. They did this, but these statues were\r\n        not worshiped until the coming generations deviated from the right way of life. Then they\r\n        worshipped them as their idols.\"</p>\r\n    <p>In his version, Ibn Jarir narrated: \"There were righteous people who lived in the period between\r\n        Adam and Noah and who had followers who held them as models. After their death, their friends\r\n        who used to emulate them said: 'If we make statues of them, it will be more pleasing to us in our\r\n        worship and will remind us of them.' So they built statues of them, and , after they had died and\r\n        others came after them, Iblis crept into their minds saying:'Your forefathers used to worship them,\r\n        and through that worship they got rain.' So they worshipped them.\"</p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Abi Hatim related this story: \"Waddan was a righteous man who was loved by his people.\r\n        When he died, they withdrew to his grave in the land of Babylonia and were overwhelmed by\r\n        sadness. When Iblis saw their sorrow caused by his death, he disguised himself in the form of a\r\n        man saying: 'I have seen your sorrow because of this man's death; can I make a statue like him\r\n        which could be put in your meeting place to make you remember him?' They said: 'Yes.'\r\n        So he made the statue like him. They put it in their meeting place in order to be reminded of him.\r\n        When Iblis saw their interest in remembering him, he said: 'Can I build a statue of him in the home\r\n        of each one of you so that he would be in everyone's house and you could remember him?'\r\n        They agreed. Their children learned about and saw what they were doing. They also learned about\r\n        their remembrance of him instead of Allah. So the first to be worshipped instead of Allah was\r\n        Waddan, the idol which they named thus.\"</p>\r\n    <p>The essence of this point is that every idol from those earlier mentioned was worshipped by a\r\n        certain group of people. It was mentioned that people made picture sand as the ages passed they\r\n        made these pictures into statues, so that their forms could be fully recognized; afterwards they\r\n        were worshipped instead of Allah.</p>\r\n    <p>It was narrated that Umm Salmah and Umm Habibah told Allah's Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)\r\n        about the church called \"Maria\" which they had seen in the land of Abyssinia. They described its\r\n        beauty and the pictures therein. He said: \"Those are the people who build places of worship on\r\n        the grave of every dead man who was righteous and then make therein those pictures. Those are\r\n        the worst of creation unto Allah.\" (Sahih al Bukhari).</p>\r\n    <p>Worshipping anything other than Allah is a tragedy that results not only in the loss of freedom; its\r\n        serious effect reaches man's mind and destroys it as well. Almighty Allah created man and his\r\n        mind with its purpose set on achieving knowledge the most important of which is that Allah alone\r\n        is the Creator and all the rest are worshippers (slaves). Therefore, disbelief in Allah, or\r\n        polytheism, results in the loss of freedom, the destruction of the mind, and the absence of a noble\r\n        target in life. (By worshipping anything other than Allah, man becomes enslaved to Satan, who is\r\n        himself a creature and becomes harnessed to his own baser qualities).\r\n        Into this environment Allah sent Noah with His message to his people. Noah was the only\r\n        intellectual not caught in the whirlpool of man's destruction which was caused by polytheism.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>The Rejection of Nuh’s People</h4>\r\n    <p>Allah in His Mercy sent His messenger Noah to guide his people. Noah was an excellent speaker\r\n        and a very patient man. He pointed out to his people the mysteries of life and the wonders of the\r\n        universe. He pointed out how the night is regularly followed by the day and that the balance\r\n        between these opposites were designed by Allah the Almighty for our good. The night gives\r\n        coolness and rest while the day gives warmth and awakens activity. The sun encourages growth,\r\n        keeping all plants and animals alive, while the moon and stars assist in the reckoning of time,\r\n        direction and seasons. He pointed out that the ownership of the heavens and the earth belongs\r\n        only to the Divine Creator. Therefore, he explained to this people, there cannot have been more\r\n        than one deity. He clarified to them how the devil had deceived them for so long and that the time\r\n        had come for this deceit to stop. Noah spoke to them of Allah's glorification of man, how HE had\r\n        created him and provided him with sustenance and the blessings of a mind. He told them that idol\r\n        worshipping was a suffocating injustice to the mind. He warned them not to worship anyone but\r\n        Allah and described the terrible punishment Allah would mete out if they continued in their evil ways.</p>\r\n    <p>The people of Prophet Nuh, especially the leaders and the wealthy, were stubborn in their refusal to abandon their idols. They ridiculed Nuh and accused him of madness. They questioned why Allah would choose a mere human like Nuh to be His messenger, especially someone who did not belong to the ranks of the powerful or the wealthy.</p>\r\n    <p>Allah, All Glory belongs to Him said:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"They said, 'Should we believe in you, when only the lowest of people follow you?' He said, 'And what knowledge do I have of what they used to do? Their account is only with my Lord, if you could perceive.'\" <br>(Surah Ash-Shu'ara, 26:111-113)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>“The chiefs of the disbelievers among his people said: \"We see you but a man like ourselves.\"'\r\n        (Surah 11:27)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The arrogance of Nuh’s people led them to dismiss his message, thinking that those who followed him were of a lower social class. They believed that their wealth and status granted them immunity from any consequences or divine punishment.</p>\r\n    <p>He, however, had never said anything other than that. He asserted that, indeed, he was only a\r\n        human being; Allah had sent a human messenger because the earth was inhabited by humans. If it\r\n        had been inhabited by angels Allah would have sent an angelic messenger. The contest between\r\n        the polytheists and Noah continued, the rulers had thought at first that Noah's call would soon\r\n        fade on its own. When they found that his call attracted the poor, the helpless and common\r\n        laborers, they started to verbally attack and taunt him: 'You are only followed by the poor, the\r\n        meek and the worthless.'</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Indeed We sent Noah to his people (he said): \"I have come to you as a plain Warner that you\r\n        worship none but Allah, surely, I fear for you the torment of a painful Day.\" the chiefs of the\r\n        disbeliveers among his people said: \"We see you but a man like ourselves, nor do we see any\r\n        follow you but the meanest among us and they too followed you without thinking. And we do not\r\n        see in you any merit above us in fact we think you are liars.\" (Surah 11:25-27).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>As years passed, Nuh’s heart grew heavy with sorrow for his people. Despite his continued efforts, they became more obstinate in their disbelief. They even went so far as to put their fingers in their ears and cover themselves with their clothes whenever he approached them, so they wouldn’t have to hear his message.</p>\r\n    <p>The rulers were tired of Noah's arguments. Allah the Exalted related their attitude:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>They said: \"O Noah! You have disputed with us and much have you prolonged the dispute with\r\n        us, now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful.\" He said: \"Only Allah\r\n        will bring it (the punishment)on you, if He will, and then you will escape not. And my advice will\r\n        not profit you, even if I wish to give you counsel, if Allah's Will is to keep you astray. He is your\r\n        Lord! And to Him you shall return.\" (Surah 11:32-34)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>“The leaders of his people said: \"Verily, we see you in plain error.\" (Surah 7:60)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Noah responded in the manner of the prophets:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"O my people! There is no error in me, but I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Alamin\r\n        (mankind, jinn and all that exists)! I convey unto you the Messages of my Lord and give sincere\r\n        advice to you. And I know from Allah what you know not.\" (Surah 7:61-62)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h4>The Length of Noah's Preaching</h4>\r\n    <p>Noah continued to call his people to believe in Allah for nine hundred fifty years. Allah the\r\n        Almighty said:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>Indeed We sent Noah to his people and he stayed among them a thousand years\r\n        less fifty years (inviting them to believe in the Oneness of Allah (Monotheism) and discard the\r\n        false gods and other deities). (Surah 29:14)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>There came a day when Allah revealed to Noah that no others would believe. Allah inspired him not to grieve for them at which point Noah prayed that the disbeliveers be destroyed. He said:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"My Lord! Leave not one of the disbeliveers on the earth. If you leave them, they will mislead\r\n        Your slaves and they will beget none but wicked disbeliveers.\" (Surah 71:27)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Allah’s Command: The Building of the Ark</h4>\r\n    <p>After centuries of rejection, Allah revealed to Nuh that none of his people would believe except those who had already embraced the faith. He instructed Nuh to stop calling them and instead build an ark, as a great flood would soon come to cleanse the earth of the disbelievers.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And it was revealed to Nuh that, 'None of your people will believe except those who have already believed, so do not be distressed by what they have been doing. And construct the ship under Our observation and Our inspiration, and do not address Me concerning those who have wronged; indeed, they are to be drowned.'\" <br>(Surah Hud, 11:36-37)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Nuh began constructing the ark, following Allah’s precise instructions, even though there was no water nearby. As Nuh and the believers built the ark, the disbelievers mocked and ridiculed them even more, saying, \"Will you sail the ship on land?\" However, Nuh remained steadfast, knowing that Allah’s promise was true and that the flood would indeed come.</p>\r\n    <p>Allah the Almighty narrated:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"As he was constructing the ship, whenever the chiefs of his people passed by him, they made a\r\n        mockery of him. He said : \"If you mock at us, so do we mock at you likewise for your mocking.\r\n        And you will know who it is on whom will come a torment that will cover him with disgrace and\r\n        on whom will fall a lasting torment.\" (Surah 11:38-39)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h4>The Great Flood</h4>\r\n    <p>The ship was constructed, and Noah sat waiting Allah's command. Allah revealed to him that\r\n        when water miraculously gushed forth from the oven at Noah's house, that would be the sign of\r\n        the start of the flood, and the sign for Noah to act. When the time came, Allah commanded Nuh to take a pair of each species of animals, as well as his family and the believers, into the ark. These would be the only survivors of the impending flood. Nuh, in his compassion, called out to his son, who had chosen to remain with the disbelievers:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And Nuh called to his son, who was apart [from them], 'O my son, come aboard with us and do not be with the disbelievers.' But he [the son] said, 'I will take refuge on a mountain to protect me from the water.' [Nuh] said, 'There is no protector today from the decree of Allah, except for whom He gives mercy.' And the waves came between them, and he was among the drowned.\" <br>(Surah Hud, 11:42-43)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The terrible day arrived when the oven at Noah's house overflowed. Noah hurried to open the ark\r\n        and summon the believers. He also took with him a pair, male and female, of every type of animal,\r\n        bird and insect. Seeing him taking these creatures to the ark, the people laughed loudly: \"Noah\r\n        must have gone out of his head! What is he going to do with the animals?\" Almighty Allah\r\n        narrated:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>“So it was till then there came Our Command and the oven gushed forth (water like fountains\r\n        from the earth). We said: \"Embark therein, of each kind two (male and female), and your family,\r\n        except him against whom the Word has already gone forth, and those who believe.\" And none\r\n        believed him except a few. (Surah 11:40)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The sky poured forth torrential rain, and water gushed from the earth. The disbelievers realized too late that Nuh had been telling the truth. The floodwaters rose quickly, submerging everything. The ark, carrying the believers, the animals, and Prophet Nuh, sailed safely above the stormy waters.</p>\r\n    <p>Noah's wife was not a believer with him so she did not join him; neither did one of Noah's sons,\r\n        who was secretly a disbeliever but had pretended faith in front of Noah. Likewise most of the\r\n        people were disbeliveers and did not go on board.\r\n        The scholars hold different opinions on the number of those who were with Noah on the ship. Ibn\r\n        Abbas stated that there were 80 believers while Ka ab al Ahbar held that there were 72 believers.\r\n        Others claimed that there were 10 believers with Noah.</p>\r\n    <p>Water rose from the cracks in the earth; there was not a crack from which water did not rise. rain\r\n        poured from the sky in quantities never seen before on earth. Water continued pouring from the\r\n        sky rising from the cracks; hour after hour the level rose. The seas and waves invaded the land.\r\n        The interior of the earth moved in a strange way, and the ocean floors lifted suddenly, flooding\r\n        the dry land. The earth, for the first time was submerged.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Noah Appeals to his Son</h4>\r\n    <p>Allah told the story thus: He (Noah) said:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Embark therein in the Name of Allah will be its moving course and its resting anchorage.\r\n        Surely, my Lord is Oft Forgiving, most Merciful.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        So it (the ship) sailed with them amidst the waves like mountains, and Noah called out to his son,\r\n        who had separated himself (apart), \"O my son! Embark with us and be not with the disbeliveers.\"\r\n        The son replied, \"I will betake myself to a mountain, it will save me from the water.\" Noah said:\r\n        \"This day there is no savior from the Decree of Allah except him on whom He has mercy.\" And a\r\n        wave came in between them so he (the son) was among the drowned.\" (Surah. 11: 41-43)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h4>The End of the Flood and Allah’s Mercy</h4>\r\n    <p>After many days, the rain ceased, and the water began to recede. The ark came to rest on Mount Judi, and Nuh was commanded by Allah to disembark with the believers and the animals. Allah promised that those who remained faithful would flourish and populate the earth anew:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"O Earth! Swallow up your water, and O sky! Withhold (your rain).\" The water was diminished\r\n        (made to subside) and the Decree (of Allah) was fulfilled (the destruction of the people of Noah).\r\n        And it (the ship) rested on Mount Judi, and it was said: \"Away with the people who are Zalimeen\r\n        (polytheists, and wrongdoing)!\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        \"O Noah! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the\r\npeople who are with you(and on some of their offspring), but (there will be other) people to\r\nwhom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach\r\nthem from Us.\" <br>(Surah Hud, 11:48)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The believers rejoiced, grateful for Allah’s mercy and protection. They knew that they had been saved not by their own strength, but by the grace of Allah. Prophet Nuh’s legacy continued through the generations that followed, as he is regarded as one of the forefathers of humankind.</p>\r\n    <p>Noah released the birds, and the beats which scattered over the earth. After that the believers\r\n        disembarked. Noah put his forehead to the ground in prostration. The survivors kindled a fire and\r\n        sat around it. Lighting a fire had been prohibited on board so as not to ignite the ship's wood and\r\n        burn it up. None of them had eaten hot food during the entire period of the floor. Following the\r\n        disembarkation there was a day of fasting in thanks to Allah.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Noah's Death</h4>\r\n    <p>The Quran draws the curtain on Noah's story. We do not know how his affairs with his people\r\n        continued. All we know or can ascertain is that on his deathbed he requested his son to worship\r\n        Allah alone, Noah then passed away. Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn Al as narrated that the Prophet\r\n        Muhammad (PBUH) said: \"When the death of the Messenger of Allah Noah approached, he\r\n        admonished his sons: 'Indeed I would give you far reaching advice, commanding you to do two\r\n        things, and warning you against doing two things as well. I charge you to believe that there is no\r\n        god but Allah and that if the seven heavens and the seven earths were put on one side of a scale\r\n        and the words \"there is no god but Allah\" were put on the other, the latter would outweigh the\r\n        former. I warn you against associating partners with Allah and against pride.\" (Sahih al Bukhari)\r\n        Some traditions said that his grave is in the Scared Mosque in Mecca, while others said that he\r\n        was buried in Baalabak, a city in Iraq.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>The Legacy of Prophet Nuh</h4>\r\n    <p>Prophet Nuh’s story is one of perseverance, patience, and trust in Allah. For nearly a millennium, he called his people to the truth, despite facing rejection, ridicule, and opposition. His unwavering faith and dedication to his mission stand as a powerful example for all believers.</p>\r\n    <p>In the Quran, Nuh is frequently mentioned as an exemplar of patience, a model for those who face adversity in their faith. His life illustrates the importance of remaining steadfast in the face of hardship, knowing that Allah’s plan is perfect and that ultimate success lies in obedience to Him.</p>\r\n    <p>The flood of Nuh serves as a reminder of the consequences of arrogance and disbelief, while the survival of the believers demonstrates Allah’s mercy and the rewards for those who remain faithful to Him.</p>\r\n    <p>Prophet Nuh’s story continues to inspire generations of Muslims to trust in Allah’s wisdom and to persist in the path of righteousness, no matter how difficult the circumstances may be.</p>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n"},{"Id":5,"LanguageCode":"en","TranslatedName":"Hud","ArabicName":"هود","ArabicTransliteratedName":"Hud","AudioFileName":"5.mp3","SourceHtml":"<body>\r\n    <p><strong>Prophet Hud (peace be upon him)</strong> was sent by Allah to the ancient people of <em>‘Ad</em>, a powerful and wealthy nation that had become arrogant and turned away from the worship of Allah. The story of Prophet Hud, which is narrated in various parts of the Quran, teaches us about the dangers of pride, idolatry, and disobedience to Allah’s commands.</p>\r\n    <p>Allah wanted to guide and discipline these people so He sent a prophet from among them. This\r\n        prophet was Hud (PBUH), a noble man who handled this task with great resoluteness and\r\n        tolerance.</p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Jarir reported that he was Hud Ibn Shalikh, Ibn Arfakhshand, Ibn Sam, Ibn Noah (PBUH). He\r\n        also reported that Prophet Hud (PBUH) was from a tribe called Ad Ibn Us Ibn Sam Ibn Noah,\r\n        who were Arabs living in Al Ahqaf in Yemen between Oman and Hadramaut, on a land called\r\n        Ashar stretching out into the sea. The name of their valley was Mughiith\r\n        Some traditions claimed that Hud (PBUH) was the first person who spoke Arabic while others\r\n        claimed that Noah (PBUH) was the first. It was also said that Adam was the first.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>The People of ‘Ad</h4>\r\n    <p>The people of ‘Ad were descendants of the Prophet Nuh (peace be upon him). They lived in the region of Ahqaf, between Yemen and Oman, in a lush and prosperous land. Known for their physical strength and impressive architectural achievements, the ‘Ad people built massive structures, strong fortresses, and towering monuments in the mountains. They prided themselves on their accomplishments and boasted about their power:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with ‘Ad, with [the people of] Iram, who had lofty pillars, the likes of whom had never been created in the land?\" <br>(Surah Al-Fajr, 89:6-8)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>However, their material success and prosperity led them to arrogance and heedlessness. The people of ‘Ad turned away from the worship of Allah and began worshiping idols, attributing their success to their false gods. They believed their wealth and strength made them invincible, and they ignored the possibility of divine retribution.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Prophethood of Hud</h4>\r\n    <p>In this time of moral decline, Allah sent Prophet Hud to guide the people of ‘Ad back to the path of monotheism and righteousness. Hud was a man from among them, known for his honesty, wisdom, and strong character. He was chosen to deliver Allah’s message and warn his people about the consequences of their actions.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And to the ‘Ad [We sent] their brother Hud. He said, 'O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. You are not but inventors [of falsehood].'\" <br>(Surah Hud, 11:50)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Hud called his people to abandon their idols and turn to the worship of Allah alone. He reminded them that it was Allah who had given them their strength, wealth, and prosperity, and it was only by His will that they thrived. Hud also warned them that if they continued in their disbelief and idolatry, they would face severe punishment from Allah.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Hud’s Appeal to His People</h4>\r\n    <p>Prophet Hud was patient and persistent in his mission. He approached his people with wisdom and kindness, trying to convince them of the truth. He reminded them of the fate of earlier nations, such as the people of Nuh, who had been destroyed for their disobedience. Hud assured his people that he sought no personal gain and that his only aim was to deliver the message of Allah for their own benefit.</p>\r\n    <p>Hud (PBUH) condemned idol worship and admonished his people. \"MY people, what is the\r\n        benefit of these stones that you carve with your own hands and worship? In reality it is an insult\r\n        to the intellect. There is only One Deity worthy of worship and that is Allah. Worship of Him and\r\n        Him alone, is compulsory on you. He created you, He provides for you and He is the One Who will cause you to die. He gave you\r\n        wonderful physiques and blessed you in many ways. So believe in Him and do not be blind to His\r\n        favors, or the same fate that destroyed Noah's people will overtake you.\"\r\n        With such reasoning Hud hoped to instill faith in them, but they refused to accept his message.\r\n        His people asked him: \"Do you desire to be our master with your call? What payment do you\r\n        want?\"Hud tried to make them understand that he would receive his payment (reward) from\r\n        Allah; he did not demand anything from them except that they let the light of truth touch their\r\n        minds and hearts.</p>\r\n    <p>Allah the Almighty states:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And to Ad people We sent their brother Hud. He said: \"O my people! Worship Allah! You have\r\n        no other Ilah (god) but Him; Certainly, you do nothing but invent (lies)! O my people I ask of\r\n        you no reward for it (the Message). My reward is only from Him Who created me. Will you not\r\n        then understand? And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him, He\r\n        will send you (from the sky) abundant rain, and add strength to your strength, so do not turn\r\n        away as Mujrimeen (criminals, disbeliveers in the Oneness of Allah).\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        They said: \"O Hud! No evidence have you brought us and we shall not leave our gods for your\r\n        mere saying! We are not believers in you. All that we say is that some of our gods (false deities)\r\n        have seized you with evil (madness).\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        HE said: \"I call Allah to witness and bear you witness that I am free from that which you ascribe\r\n        as partners in worship, and with Him (Allah). SO plot against me, all of you, and give me no\r\n        respite. I put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving (living) creature\r\n        but HE has grasp of its forelock. Verily, my Lord is on the Straight Path (the truth). SO if you\r\n        turn away, still I have conveyed the Message with which I was sent to you. My Lord will make\r\n        another people succeed you, and you will not harm Him in the least. Surely, my Lord is\r\n        Guardian over all things.\" (Surah Hud 11:50-57)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Hud’s message was clear: if the people of ‘Ad repented and returned to the worship of Allah, they would be blessed with even greater strength, prosperity, and security. However, if they continued in their rebellion and idolatry, they would face divine punishment.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>The Rejection of Prophet Hud</h4>\r\n    <p>Despite Hud’s sincere efforts, the majority of the people of ‘Ad rejected his message. The leaders and the wealthy among them, in particular, were arrogant and dismissive. They ridiculed Hud, accusing him of being foolish and insane:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"The chiefs of those who disbelieved among his people said, 'Indeed, we see you in foolishness, and indeed, we think you are of the liars.'\" <br>(Surah Al-A’raf, 7:66)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The chiefs of Hud's people asked: \"Is it not strange that Allah's chooses one of us to reveal His\r\n        message to?\"\r\n        Hud replied:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"What is strange in that? Allah wants to guide you to the right way of life, so HE\r\n        sent me to warn you. Noah's flood and his story are not far away from you, so do not forget what\r\n        happened. All the disbeliveers were destroyed, no matter how strong they were.\"</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Who is going to destroy us Hud?\" the chiefs asked.</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Allah.\" replied Hud.</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>The disbeliveers among his people answered: \"We will be saved by our gods.\"</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Hud clarified to them that the gods they worshipped would be the reason for their destruction,\r\n        that it is Allah alone Who saves people, and that no other power on earth can benefit or harm\r\n        anyone.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"The chiefs of his people, whom disbelieved and denied the meeting in the Hereafter, and to who\r\n        We had given the luxuries and comforts of this life, said: \"He is no more than a human being\r\n        like you, he eats of that which you eat, and drinks of what you drink. If you were to obey a\r\n        human being like yourselves then verily! You indeed would be losers. Does he promise you that\r\n        when you have died and have become dust and bones, you shall come out alive (resurrected)?\r\n        Far, very far, is that which you are promised. There is nothing but our life of this world! We die\r\n        and we live! We are not going to be resurrected! He is only a man who has invented a lie against\r\n        Allah, but we are not going to believe in him.\" (Surah 23:33-38)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>They questioned why a man like Hud, who was no different from them, would claim to be a prophet. They boasted of their strength and their superior civilization, saying that no power, including Allah, could bring them down:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"They said, 'Who is greater than us in strength?' Did they not consider that Allah, who created them, was greater than them in strength? But they were rejecting Our signs.\" <br>(Surah Fussilat, 41:15)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Their pride blinded them to the truth, and they continued to indulge in their idolatry and sinful ways, confident that no punishment would come upon them. They dismissed Hud’s warnings as mere threats and continued to defy Allah’s commands.</p>\r\n    <p>Almighty Allah repeated their words in the Quran:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"O my Hud! No evidence have you brought us, and we shall not leave our gods for your mere\r\n        saying! And we are not believers in you. All that we say is that some of our gods (false deities)\r\n        have seized you with evil (madness).\" (Surah 11:53-54)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Hud had to return their challenge. He had no other way but to turn to Allah alone, no other\r\n        alternative but to give them a threatening ultimatum. he declared to them:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"I call Allah to witness\r\n        and bear you witness that I am free from that which you ascribe in worship with Him (Allah).\r\n        SO plot against me, all of you and give me no respite. I put my trust in Allah, my Lord your\r\n        Lord! There is not a moving (living) creature but He has grasp of its forelock. Verily, my Lord is\r\n        on the Straight Path (the truth). So if you turn away, still I have conveyed the message with\r\n        which it was sent to you. My Lord will make another people succeed you, and you will not harm\r\n        Him.\" (Surah 11:54-57)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h4>The Consequence: The Punishment of ‘Ad</h4>\r\n    <p>Thus Hud renounced them and their gods and affirmed his dependence on Allah Who had created\r\n        him. Hud realized that punishment would be incurred on the disbeliveers among his people. It is\r\n        one of the laws of life. Allah punishes the disbeliveers, no matter how rich, tyrannical or great\r\n        they are.</p>\r\n    <p>Allah revealed to Hud that his people would not believe, and that they would face divine punishment for their disobedience. The punishment came in the form of a fierce windstorm, unlike anything they had ever seen. The wind was sent as a devastating sign of Allah’s wrath.</p>\r\n    <p>Hud and his people waited for Allah's promise. A drought spread throughout the land, for the sky\r\n        no longer sent its rain. the sun scorched the desert sands, looking like a disk of fire which settled\r\n        on people's heads.</p>\r\n    <p>Hud's people hastened to him asking: \"What is that drought Hud?\"\r\n        Hud answered: \"Allah is angry with you. If you believe in Him, He will accept you and the rain\r\n        will fall and you will become stronger than you are.\"</p>\r\n    <p>They mocked him and became more obstinate, sarcastic and preserve in their unbelief. The\r\n        drought increased, the trees turned yellow, and plants died.\r\n        A day came when they found the sky full of clouds. Hud's people were glad as they came out of\r\n        their tents crying: \"A cloud, which will give us rain!\"\r\n        The weather changed suddenly from burning dry and hot to stinging cold with wind that shook\r\n        everything; trees, plants, tents, men and women. The wind increased day after day and night after\r\n        night.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"So We sent upon them a screaming wind during days of misfortune to make them taste the punishment of disgrace in the worldly life; but the punishment of the Hereafter is more disgracing, and they will not be helped.\" <br>(Surah Fussilat, 41:16)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The windstorm, which lasted for seven nights and eight days, destroyed everything in its path. The people of ‘Ad, who once prided themselves on their strength and invincibility, were utterly helpless. Their massive structures, fortresses, and homes were reduced to rubble, and they perished under the wrath of Allah.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Hud's people started to flee. They ran to their tents to hide but the gale became stronger, ripping\r\n        their tents from their stakes. They hid under cloth covers but the gale became stronger and still\r\n        and tore away the covers. It slashed clothing and skin. It penetrated the apertures of the body and\r\n        destroyed it. It hardly touched anything before it was destroyed or killed, its core sucked out to\r\n        decompose and rot.</p>\r\n    <p>The Quran describes the fate of the people of ‘Ad in vivid terms, showing the power of Allah and the consequences of arrogance:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Then when they saw it as a dense cloud coming towards their valleys, they said: \"This is a cloud\r\n        bringing us rain!\" Nay but it is that torment which you were asking to be hastened! a wind\r\n        wherein is a painful torment! Destroying everything by the command of its Lord! (Surah 46:24-25)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And as for ‘Ad, they were destroyed by a screaming, violent wind which He imposed upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession, so you would see the people therein fallen as if they were hollow trunks of palm trees.\" <br>(Surah Al-Haqqah, 69:6-7)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Only Prophet Hud and the small group of believers who followed him were spared. They were saved from the calamity and were shown mercy by Allah for their faith and obedience. They migrated to Hadramaut and lived there in peace, worshipping Allah, their true Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>The Lessons from Prophet Hud’s Story</h4>\r\n    <p>The story of Prophet Hud and the people of ‘Ad offers important lessons for all believers. It reminds us of the dangers of pride, arrogance, and disobedience to Allah’s commands. The people of ‘Ad had been blessed with immense wealth, strength, and power, yet they allowed their success to lead them astray. Instead of being grateful to Allah and following His guidance, they became arrogant and rebellious, which led to their destruction.</p>\r\n    <p>Prophet Hud’s unwavering dedication to his mission, despite facing rejection and mockery, serves as a powerful example of patience and perseverance in the path of truth. His story teaches us that success in this world is fleeting, and that true success lies in obeying Allah and worshiping Him alone.</p>\r\n    <p>Furthermore, Hud’s story highlights the importance of humility and recognizing that all power and success come from Allah. The destruction of the people of ‘Ad serves as a reminder that no human strength or civilization is invincible, and that Allah’s power is supreme over all.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>The Legacy of Prophet Hud</h4>\r\n    <p>Prophet Hud’s legacy continues to inspire believers to this day. He is remembered for his steadfastness in delivering Allah’s message, even in the face of extreme opposition. His life serves as a reminder of the importance of remaining firm in one’s faith and calling others to the truth, no matter how difficult the circumstances.</p>\r\n    <p>The destruction of the people of ‘Ad also serves as a warning to those who turn away from the worship of Allah and indulge in arrogance and pride. Hud’s story stands as a testament to the consequences of rejecting divine guidance and the rewards for those who remain faithful and obedient to their Lord.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n"},{"Id":6,"LanguageCode":"en","TranslatedName":"Saleh","ArabicName":"صالح","ArabicTransliteratedName":"Saleh","AudioFileName":"6.mp3","SourceHtml":"<body>\r\n    <p>After the destruction of the Ad, the tribe of Thamud succeeded them in power and glory. They\r\n        also fell to idol-worshipping. As their material wealth increased so, too, did their evil ways while\r\n        their virtue decreased. Like the people of Ad, they erected huge buildings on the plains and hewed\r\n        beautiful homes out of the hills. Tyranny and oppression became prevalent as evil men ruled the land. <strong>Prophet Saleh (peace be upon him)</strong> was sent by Allah to the people of <em>Thamud</em>, a great civilization that lived in a region known for its wealth, power, and architectural achievements. However, like many nations before them, the Thamud became arrogant and turned away from the worship of Allah. The story of Prophet Saleh, narrated in several places in the Quran, teaches us about the consequences of rejecting divine guidance and the mercy of Allah toward those who repent.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Description of Salih</h4>\r\n    <p>So Allah sent unto them His Prophet Salih (PBUH), a man from among them. His name was Salih\r\n        Ibn Ubeid, Ibn Maseh, Ibn Ubeid, Ibn Hader, Ibn Thamud, Ibn Ather, Ibn Eram, Ibn Noah. He\r\n        called his people to worship Allah alone, and to not associate partners with Him. While some of\r\n        them believed him, the majority of them disbelieved and harmed him by both words and deeds.\r\n        Salih directed them:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"O my people! Worship Allah, you have no other Ilah (god) but Him.\" (Surah 11:61)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Salih was known for his wisdom, purity and goodness and had been greatly respected by his\r\n        people before Allah's revelation came to him. Salih's people said to him:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"O Salih! You have been among us as a figure of good hope and we wished for you to be our\r\n        chief, till this, new thing which you have brought that we leave our gods and worship your God\r\n        (Allah) alone! Do you now forbid us the worship of what our fathers have worshipped? But we\r\n        are really in grave doubt as to that which you invite us to monotheism.\" (Surah 11:62).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The People of Thamud</h2>\r\n    <p>The people of Thamud were descendants of the ancient people of ‘Ad, who had been destroyed for their disobedience to Allah. Thamud lived in the region between Hijaz and Jordan, in a place called Al-Hijr. They were skilled in construction and architecture, carving magnificent homes into the mountains and living in luxurious dwellings. Their wealth, prosperity, and strength made them feel invincible.</p>\r\n    <p>Like their predecessors, the Thamud turned to idol worship and began to associate partners with Allah. Despite their material success, their spiritual corruption led them to forget the One who had provided them with everything they enjoyed. The people of Thamud needed a reminder of Allah’s guidance, so Allah chose Saleh from among them to be their prophet and guide them back to the straight path.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Prophet Saleh’s Mission</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Saleh was from a noble family among the Thamud and was highly respected by his people for his wisdom, integrity, and piety. He was chosen by Allah to call his people back to monotheism and righteousness. Like the prophets before him, Saleh delivered a clear message: to worship Allah alone and forsake the false gods they had created.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And to Thamud [We sent] their brother Saleh. He said, 'O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. He has produced you from the earth and settled you in it, so ask forgiveness of Him and then repent to Him. Indeed, my Lord is near and responsive.'\" <br>(Surah Hud, 11:61)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Saleh reminded the people of Thamud that it was Allah who had blessed them with their wealth, strength, and the ability to build their magnificent homes. He urged them to repent for their sins and return to the worship of the One True God, promising them forgiveness and mercy from Allah if they did so.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The People’s Response to Saleh</h2>\r\n    <p>Although some people listened to Prophet Saleh’s message and believed, the majority of the Thamud were proud and defiant. The leaders of the community, who enjoyed power and wealth, refused to accept Saleh’s call. They ridiculed him, claiming that he was just an ordinary man like themselves. They demanded a miracle as proof that he was truly a prophet of Allah:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"They said, 'O Saleh, you were among us a man of promise before this. Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped? And indeed we are about that to which you invite us, in disquieting doubt.'\" <br>(Surah Hud, 11:62)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>They merely wanted to worship the same gods as their fathers had, with no reason, no proof, no\r\n        thought. The proof of Salih's (PBUH) message was evident, but despite this it was obvious that\r\n        most of his people did not believe him. They doubted his words, thinking he was charmed, and\r\n        they saw that he would not stop preaching. Fearing that his followers would increase, they tried to\r\n        put him off by assigning him an important task; to prove that he was a messenger of Allah by\r\n        performing a miracle. The leaders of Thamud demanded a specific miracle: they asked Saleh to produce a she-camel from the solid rock as a sign of his prophethood. Let a unique she camel issue from the mountains. Allah granted Salih this\r\n        miracle and a huge, unique, she camel appeared from the direction of the mountain.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Miracle of the She-Camel</h2>\r\n    <p>The Quranic\r\n        commentators said that the people of Thamud gathered on a certain day at their meeting place,\r\n        and the prophet Salih (PBUH) came and addressed them to believe in Allah, reminding them of\r\n        the favors Allah had granted them. Then pointing at a rock, they demanded: \"Ask your Lord to\r\n        make a she camel, which must be 10 months pregnant, tall and attractive, issue from the rock for\r\n        us.\" Salih replied: \"Look now! If Allah sends you what you have requested, just as you have\r\n        described, will you believe in that which I have come to you with and have faith in the message I\r\n        have been sent with?\"</p>\r\n    <p>They answered: \"Yes.\"</p>\r\n    <p>By the will of Allah, Saleh’s prayer was answered, and from the rock emerged a majestic, miraculous she-camel. This she-camel was unlike any other, and its appearance was a clear sign from Allah to the people of Thamud. However, along with this miracle came a warning from Allah:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And O my people, this is the she-camel of Allah - [she is] to you a sign. So let her feed upon Allah’s earth and do not touch her with harm, or you will be taken by an impending punishment.\" <br>(Surah Hud, 11:64)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>A number of Salih's people believed, yet most of them continued in their disbelief, stubbornness,\r\n        and going astray. Allah the Almighty said:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"We sent the she camel to Thamud as a clear sign, but they did her wrong. (Surah 17:59)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Verily the dwellers of Al Hijr (the rocky tract) denied the Messengers. We gave them Our Signs,\r\n        but they were averse to them. (Surah 15:80-81)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The she-camel was a test for the people of Thamud. Allah commanded them to treat her kindly and allow her to graze freely on their land. The she-camel was also given special rights: she was to drink water from the well on certain days, while the people of Thamud would take turns drinking on the other days.</p>\r\n    <p>There are a number of ancient accounts of this camel and its miraculous nature. It was said that\r\n        the she camel was miraculous because a rock in the mountain split open and it came forth from it,\r\n        followed by its young offspring. Other accounts said that the she camel used to drink all the water\r\n        in the wells in one day, and no other animals could approach the water. Still others claimed that\r\n        the she camel produced milk sufficient for all the people to drink, on the same day that it drank all\r\n        the water, leaving none for them. At first, the people of Thamud were greatly surprised when the\r\n        she camel issued from the mountain rocks. It was a blessed camel, and its milk sufficient for\r\n        thousands of men, women and children. If it slept in a place that place was abandoned by other\r\n        animals. Thus it was obvious that is was not an ordinary camel, but one of Allah's signs. It lived\r\n        among Salih's people, some of whom believed in Allah while the majority continued in their\r\n        obstinacy and disbelief. Their hatred of Salih turned towards the blessed she camel and became\r\n        centered on it. A conspiracy started to be hatched against the camel by the disbeliveers, and they\r\n        secretly plotted against it.</p>\r\n    <p>For awhile, Salih's people let the camel graze and drink freely, but in their hearts they hated it.\r\n        However, the miraculous appearance of the unique camel caused many to become Salih's\r\n        followers, and they clung to their belief in Allah.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Rejection and Sin of the People</h2>\r\n    <p>For a time, the people of Thamud respected the command and allowed the she-camel to roam and drink. However, their arrogance and disbelief soon led them to plot against the miracle. The leaders of Thamud, resentful of Saleh’s influence and the she-camel’s presence, conspired to kill her.</p>\r\n    <p>The disbeliveers now began complaining that this huge she camel with its unusual qualities drank\r\n        most of the water and frightened their cattle.\r\n        They laid a plot to kill the camel, and sought the help of their women folk to tempt the men to\r\n        carry out their commands. Saduq bint of Mahya, who was from a rich and noble family, offered\r\n        herself to a young man named Masrai Ibn Mahraj on condition that he hamstring the camel. Aniza,\r\n        an old woman, offered one of her daughters to a young man, Qudar Ibn Saluf, in return for killing\r\n        the camel. Naturally these young men were tempted and set about finding seven others to assist\r\n        them.</p>\r\n    <p>A group of nine individuals from the most rebellious among them took it upon themselves to carry out the deed. They attacked and slaughtered the she-camel, defying Allah’s warning:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"But they hamstrung her, and so he said, 'Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days. That is a promise not to be denied.'\" <br>(Surah Hud, 11:65)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>They watched the camel closely, observing all its movements. As the she camel came to drink at\r\n        the well, Masarai shot it in the leg with an arrow. It tried to escape but was hampered by the\r\n        arrow. Qudar followed the camel and struck it with a sword in the other leg. As it fell to the\r\n        ground, he pierced it with his sword.</p>\r\n    <p>The killers were given a hero's welcome, cheered with songs and poetry composed in their praise.\r\n        In their arrogance they mocked Salih, but he warned them: \"Enjoy life for 3 more days then the\r\n        punishment will descend upon you.\" Salih was hoping that they would see the folly of their ways\r\n        and change their attitude before the three days went out.</p>\r\n    <p>Saleh warned his people that they had only three days to repent before Allah’s punishment would descend upon them. However, the people continued in their arrogance, mocking Saleh and dismissing his warning. Instead of repenting, they even plotted to kill Saleh himself, hoping to silence his message once and for all.</p>\r\n    <p>\"Why three days?\" they asked. \"Let the punishment come as quickly as possible.\"</p>\r\n    <p>He pleaded with them: \"My people, why do you hasten to evil rather than good? Why do not you\r\n        ask pardon of Allah so that you may receive mercy?\"</p>\r\n    <p>They replied: \"We see your presence and that of your followers as bringing evil on us.\" Almighty Allah related their story:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And indeed We sent to Thamud their brother Salih, saying \"Worship Allah Alone and none\r\n        else.\" Then look! They became two parties (believers and disbeliveers) quarreling with each\r\n        other.\r\n        He said: \"O my people! Why do you seek to hasten the evil (torment) before the good (Allah's\r\n        Mercy)? Why seek you not the Forgiveness of Allah, that you may receive mercy?\" They said:\r\n        We augur till omen from you and those with you.\" he said: \"Your ill omen is with Allah; nay, but\r\n        you are a people that are being tested.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        And there were in the city nine men (from the sons of their chiefs), who made mischief in the\r\n        land, and would not reform. They said: \"Swear to another by Allah that we shall make a secret\r\n        night attack on him and his household, and afterwards we will surely say to his near relatives:\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        \"We witnessed not the destruction of his household, and verily! We are telling the truth.\"\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not. Then see how was the\r\n        end of their plot! Verily! We destroyed them and their nation, all together. These are their\r\n        houses in utter ruin, for they did wrong. Verily, in this is indeed an Ayah (a lesson or a sign) for\r\n        people who know. We saved those who believed, and used to fear and obey Allah. (Surah 27:45-53)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <p>They also plotted to kill Salih and his household as Almighty Allah stated:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"So they plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not.\" (Surah 27:50)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Allah saved\r\n        Salih and his followers from their wicked plans. Heavy hearted, they left the evil doers and moved\r\n        to another place. Three days after Salih's warning, thunderbolts filled the air, followed by severe\r\n        earthquakes which destroyed the entire tribe and its homeland. The land was violently shaken,\r\n        destroying all living creatures in it. There was one terrific cry which had hardly ended when the\r\n        disbeliveers of Salih's people were struck dead, one and all, at the same time. Neither their strong\r\n        buildings nor their rock hewn homes could protect them.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Punishment of Thamud</h2>\r\n    <p>After three days passed, Allah’s punishment came swiftly and decisively. A terrible earthquake struck the land, followed by a deafening blast from the heavens. The people of Thamud, who had once boasted of their strength and invulnerability, were completely destroyed in an instant. Their homes, carved into the mountains, became their graves:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And the shriek seized those who had wronged, and they became within their homes [corpses] fallen prone.\" <br>(Surah Hud, 11:67)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>All were destroyed before they realized what was happening. As for the people who believed in\r\n        the message of Salih (PBUH), they were saved because they had left the place.\r\n        Ibn Umar narrated that while the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was passing by Thamud's houses\r\n        on his way to the battle of Tabuk, he stopped together with the people there. the people fetched\r\n        water from the wells from which the people of Thamud used to drink. They prepared their dough\r\n        (for baking) and filled their water skins from it (the water from the wells). The Prophet of Allah\r\n        (PBUH) ordered them to empty the water skins and give the prepared dough to the camels. Then\r\n        he went away with them until they stopped at the well from which the she camel (of Salih) used to\r\n        drink. He warned them against entering upon the people that had been punished, saying \"I fear\r\n        that you may be affected by what afflicted them; so do no enter upon them.\"</p>\r\n    <p>The once-mighty civilization of Thamud was wiped out, leaving behind only their ruined dwellings as a reminder of their arrogance and disobedience. Saleh and the small group of believers who had followed him were saved by Allah’s mercy, as they had remained steadfast in their faith.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Lessons from Prophet Saleh’s Story</h2>\r\n    <p>The story of Prophet Saleh and the people of Thamud teaches several important lessons for all believers. First and foremost, it reminds us of the consequences of rejecting Allah’s guidance and indulging in arrogance and idolatry. The people of Thamud were blessed with great wealth, power, and technological advancements, yet they allowed their pride to lead them astray.</p>\r\n    <p>Prophet Saleh’s patience and persistence in delivering Allah’s message, despite facing rejection and ridicule, serves as a model for all who call others to the truth. His story teaches us the importance of remaining steadfast in our faith and never giving up, even when faced with opposition.</p>\r\n    <p>Finally, the miraculous she-camel serves as a reminder that Allah’s signs are clear, and those who fail to heed them will face the consequences. The punishment of Thamud demonstrates that no nation, no matter how powerful or advanced, can escape the judgment of Allah when they turn away from His guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Legacy of Prophet Saleh</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Saleh’s legacy continues to inspire believers today. His story is a testament to the mercy of Allah, who gives every nation ample opportunity to repent and return to the path of righteousness. It also serves as a reminder of Allah’s justice, as those who persist in their disobedience and arrogance will ultimately face divine punishment.</p>\r\n    <p>Through the story of Saleh, we are reminded to remain humble, grateful, and obedient to Allah, recognizing that all blessings come from Him and that success lies in following His guidance. The ruins of the Thamud people’s dwellings still stand as a physical reminder of the consequences of arrogance and disbelief, serving as a powerful lesson for all of humanity.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n"},{"Id":7,"LanguageCode":"en","TranslatedName":"Lot","ArabicName":"لوط","ArabicTransliteratedName":"Lut","AudioFileName":"7.mp3","SourceHtml":"<body>\r\n    <p>Prophet Abraham (PBUH) left Egypt accompanied by his nephew Lut (PBUH), <strong>Prophet Lut (peace be upon him)</strong> was sent by Allah to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, ancient cities known for their corruption, immorality, and disobedience to Allah. Prophet Lut’s mission was to guide these people away from their sinful practices, especially the widespread sexual immorality that characterized their society.</p>\r\n    <p>This city was filled with evil. Its residents waylaid, robbed and killed travelers. Another common\r\n        evil among them was that men had relations with men instead of with women. This unnatural act later\r\n        became known as sodomy (after the city of Sodom). It was practiced openly and unashamedly.</p>\r\n    <p>His story, mentioned in various parts of the Quran, illustrates the consequences of violating the natural laws of morality and the mercy of Allah for those who remain steadfast in faith.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The People of Sodom and Gomorrah</h2>\r\n    <p>The people of Sodom and Gomorrah were known for their heinous acts, particularly their involvement in same-sex relationships, which went against the natural order created by Allah. The cities were located in the region of the Dead Sea, and their inhabitants had become infamous for their defiant behavior, rejecting all moral and ethical boundaries. They were notorious for their corruption and shamelessness, and they showed no remorse for their actions.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And [mention] Lut, when he said to his people, 'Do you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds? Indeed, you approach men with desire, instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people.'\" <br>(Surah Al-A’raf, 7:80-81)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Prophet Lut, a nephew of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him), had been sent by Allah to these people to guide them back to the path of righteousness. He lived among them and witnessed their immoral acts, but despite his warnings and calls for repentance, the people of Sodom and Gomorrah persisted in their sinful ways.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Prophet Lut’s Mission</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Lut was chosen by Allah to remind the people of Sodom and Gomorrah of the natural order of human relationships and the importance of moral purity. He called them to abandon their deviant practices and return to the worship of Allah, warning them of the consequences of their actions if they refused to repent.</p>\r\n    <p>It was at the height of these crimes and sins that Allah revealed to Prophet Lut (PBUH) that he\r\n        should summon the people to give up their indecent behavior, but they were so deeply sunk in\r\n        their immoral habits that they were deaf to Lot's preaching. Swamped in their unnatural desires,\r\n        they refused to listen, even when Lot warned them of Allah's punishment. Instead, they threatened\r\n        to drive him out of the city if he kept on preaching.</p>\r\n    <p>Allah the Almighty revealed:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>The people of Lot (those dwelt in the towns of Sodom in Palestine)\r\n        belied the Messengers when their brother Lot said to them: \"Will you not fear Allah and obey\r\n        Him? Verily! I am a trustworthy Messenger to you. SO fear Allah, keep your duty to Him, and\r\n        obey me. No reward do I ask of you for it (my Message of Islamic Monotheism) my reward is\r\n        only from the Lord of the Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists). Go you in unto the males of\r\n        the Alamin (mankind), and leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your wives? Nay,\r\n        you are a trespassing people!\" They said: \"If you cease not, O Lot! Verily, you will be one of\r\n        those who are driven out!\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        HE said: \"I am indeed, of those who disapprove with severe anger and fury your (this evil)\r\n        action (of sodomy). My Lord! Save me and my family from what they do.\"\r\n        SO We saved him and his family, all except an old woman (this wife) among those who\r\n        remained behind. (Surah 26:160-171)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And Lut said to his people, 'Indeed, you commit such immorality as no one has preceded you with from among the worlds. Do you indeed approach men with desire instead of women? Rather, you are a people behaving ignorantly.'\" <br>(Surah An-Naml, 27:54-55)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Despite Lut’s sincere efforts, the people of Sodom not only rejected his message, but they also mocked and ridiculed him. They saw nothing wrong with their actions and refused to heed his warnings. Instead of reflecting on their behavior, they threatened Lut and those who followed him, warning them to leave their cities if they could not accept the prevailing immoral culture:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"But the answer of his people was only that they said, 'Evict them from your city! Indeed, they are men who keep themselves pure.'\" <br>(Surah Al-A’raf, 7:82)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The doings of Lot's people saddened his heart. Their unwholesome reputation spread throughout\r\n        the land, while he struggled against them. As the years passed, he persisted in his mission but to\r\n        no avail. No one responded to his call and believed except for the members of his family, and even\r\n        in his household, not all the members believed. Lot's wife, like Noah's wife, a disbeliever.\r\n        Allah the Almighty declared:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Allah set forth an example for those who disbelieve, the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They\r\n        were under two of Our righteous slaves, but they both betrayed their (husbands, by rejecting\r\n        their doctrines) so they (Noah & Lut) benefited them (their respective wives) not, against Allah,\r\n        and it was said: \"Enter the Fire along with those who enter!\" (Surah 66:10)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Persistence of Sin</h2>\r\n    <p>As Prophet Lut continued to warn his people, their hostility toward him grew. They became more aggressive and continued to engage in their immoral practices, openly defying Allah’s commands. They even plotted to harm the guests who visited Lut, showing their complete lack of shame and decency.</p>\r\n    <p>Lut pleaded with his people to fear Allah and abandon their wicked ways, but they mocked him further, dismissing his calls for repentance. They were not only defiant but also emboldened in their sinfulness, refusing to change their ways. Their hearts were hardened, and they were unwilling to recognize the consequences of their actions.</p>\r\n    <p>They belittled his message and mockingly challenged him:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Bring Allah's Torment upon us if you are one of the truthful!\" (Surah 29:29).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Divine Punishment</h2>\r\n    <p>After many years of warnings, Allah’s patience with the people of Sodom and Gomorrah came to an end. He sent angels in the form of human beings to deliver the news to Prophet Lut that the time for punishment had come. These angels first visited Lut’s uncle, Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him), who was informed of the impending destruction of the wicked cities.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And when Our messengers came to Ibrahim with the good news, they said, 'Indeed, we will destroy the people of that [Lut’s] city; indeed, its people have been wrongdoers.'\" <br>(Surah Al-Ankabut, 29:31)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The angels then came to Lut in the form of handsome young men. When the people of the city saw Lut’s guests, they desired to commit evil acts against them. Prophet Lut was distressed and tried to protect his guests, urging the people to fear Allah and stop their wicked behavior. However, the people persisted, and Lut felt helpless:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"He said, 'Indeed, these are my guests, so do not disgrace me. And fear Allah and do not shame me.' They said, 'Have we not forbidden you from [protecting] people?'\" <br>(Surah Al-Hijr, 15:68-70)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>At that moment, the angels revealed their true identity to Prophet Lut and informed him that the punishment was near. They told him to leave the city with his family and those who believed in him, but not to look back, for Allah’s punishment would soon descend upon the people of Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah</h2>\r\n    <p>When darkness fell on the town, Lot escorted his guest to his home. No one was aware of their\r\n        presence. However, as soon as Lot's wife saw them, she slipped out of the house quietly so that\r\n        no one noticed her. Quickly, she ran to her people with the news and it spread to all the\r\n        inhabitants like wildfire. The people rushed towards Lot quickly and excitedly. Lot was surprised\r\n        by their discovery of his guests. and he wondered who could have informed them. The matter\r\n        became clear, however, when he could not find his wife, anywhere, thus adding grief to his\r\n        sorrow.</p>\r\n    <p>When Lot saw the mob approaching his house, he shut the door, but they kept on banging on it.\r\n        He pleaded with them to leave the visitors alone and fear Allah's punishment. He urged them to\r\n        seek sexual fulfillment with their wives, for that is what Allah had made lawful.\r\n        Lot's people waited until he had finished his short sermon, and then they roared with laughter.\r\n        Blinded by passion, they broke down the door. Lot became very angry, but he stood powerless\r\n        before these violent people. He was unable to prevent the abuse of his guests, but he firmly stood\r\n        his ground and continued to plead with the mob.</p>\r\n    <p>At that terrible moment, he wished he had the power to push them away from his guests. Seeing\r\n        him in a state of helplessness, and grief the guests said: \"Do not be anxious or frightened, Lot for\r\n        we are angels, and these people will not harm you.\" On hearing this, the mob was terrified and\r\n        fled from Lot's house, hurling threats at him as they left. The angels warned Prophet Lut (pbuh) to\r\n        leave his house before sunrise, taking with him all his family except his wife. Allah had decreed\r\n        that the city of Sodom should perish. An earthquake rocked the town. IT was as if a mighty\r\n        power had lifted the entire city and flung it down in one jolt. A storm of stones rained on the city.\r\n        Everyone and everything was destroyed, including Lot's wife.</p>\r\n    <p>As Prophet Lut and his family left the city under the cover of darkness, a severe punishment befell the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. Allah commanded the earth to be turned upside down, and the cities were lifted into the sky and then crashed back to the ground. A shower of stones rained down upon the people, utterly destroying them:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"So when Our command came, We made the highest part [of the city] its lowest and rained upon them stones of layered hard clay, [which were] marked from your Lord. And Allah’s punishment is not from the wrongdoers [very] far.\" <br>(Surah Hud, 11:82-83)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were completely obliterated, leaving no trace of their existence. The only people spared were Prophet Lut and his followers, who had remained obedient to Allah. However, Lut’s wife, who had secretly sympathized with the sinners, was also destroyed, as she looked back at the city despite the divine warning not to do so.</p>\r\n    <p>The book was closed on the people of Lot (pbuh). Their towns and names have been erased from\r\n        the face of the earth. Gone are they from memory. One book was closed of the books of\r\n        corruption. Lot (pbuh) proceeded towards Abraham (pbuh). HE visited him, and when he\r\n        recounted the story of his people, he was surprised to learn that Abraham (pbuh) already knew.\r\n        So Lut (pbuh) continued to invite people to Allah, as did Abraham (pbuh), the patient one who\r\n        turned to Allah repentantly, and the two held firm to their mission.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Lessons from Prophet Lut’s Story</h2>\r\n    <p>The story of Prophet Lut and the people of Sodom and Gomorrah teaches us several important lessons. First, it serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of moral corruption and defiance of Allah’s laws. The people of Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed not only because of their immoral actions but also because of their persistent rejection of Allah’s guidance and their refusal to repent.</p>\r\n    <p>Prophet Lut’s patience and steadfastness in delivering Allah’s message, despite facing hostility and ridicule, serve as a model for all who call others to the path of righteousness. His story teaches us the importance of remaining firm in our faith and calling others to the truth, even in the face of opposition and mockery.</p>\r\n    <p>The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah also serves as a warning to future generations about the dangers of moral decline. It reminds us that while Allah is merciful and gives people ample opportunity to repent, His punishment is severe for those who persist in their disobedience and reject His guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Legacy of Prophet Lut</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Lut’s legacy continues to inspire believers today. He is remembered for his courage and dedication to spreading the message of truth, even in the face of great adversity. His story serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding moral principles and maintaining faith in Allah, even when surrounded by corruption and immorality.</p>\r\n    <p>The remains of the Dead Sea, located in the region where Sodom and Gomorrah once stood, are a physical reminder of the consequences of moral degradation. This area, known as one of the lowest points on earth, serves as a symbol of the punishment that befell those who defied Allah’s commandments and chose a path of immorality.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n"},{"Id":8,"LanguageCode":"en","TranslatedName":"Abraham","ArabicName":"إبراهيم","ArabicTransliteratedName":"Ibrahim","AudioFileName":"8.mp3","SourceHtml":"<body>\r\n    <p><strong>Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him)</strong> is one of the greatest prophets in Islam, revered as the father of many prophets and as a role model for unwavering faith and submission to Allah. His life is filled with trials, miracles, and divine guidance, and he is remembered for his profound monotheism, his struggles against idolatry, and his devotion to Allah's commands. Ibrahim is known as the friend of Allah (<em>Khalilullah</em>) and plays a central role in the lineage of prophets, including his sons, Ismail and Ishaq, and his grandson, Yaqub.</p>\r\n    <p>Some of the People of the Book stated that his name was Abraham Ibn Tarikh, Ibn Nahur, Ibn\r\n        Sarough, Ibn Raghu, Ibn Phaligh, Ibn Aher, Ibn Shalih, Ibn Arfghshand, Ibn Sam, Ibn Noah.\r\n        They said that when Tarikh was seventy five years old, he had Abraham, Nahor (Nohour) and\r\n        Haran.

The head of the\r\n        family was not even an ordinary idolater, but was one who totally rejected Allah and who used to\r\n        make the idols with his own hands. Some traditions claimed that Abraham's father died before his\r\n        birth and he was raised by an uncle whom Abraham called father. Other traditions said that his\r\n        father was alive and was named Azer.</p>\r\n    <p>Into that family Abraham was born, destined to stand against his own family, against the entire\r\n        system of his community. In brief, he stood against all kinds of polytheism.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Early Life of Ibrahim</h2>\r\n    <p>He was endowed with spiritual understanding from an early age. Allah enlightened his heart and\r\n        mind gave him wisdom from childhood. Allah the Almighty stated:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Indeed We bestowed aforetime on Abraham his (portion of) guidance, and We were Well\r\n        Acquainted with him( as to his Belief in the Oneness of Allah etc). (Surah 21:51)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Prophet Ibrahim was born in a society steeped in idol worship. His father, Azar, was a well-known sculptor who made idols for the people to worship. Despite growing up in such an environment, Ibrahim was guided by Allah to reject idolatry from an early age. He questioned the logic of worshipping statues that could neither hear nor see, nor provide any benefit or harm to their worshippers.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And [mention, O Muhammad], when Ibrahim said to his father Azar, 'Do you take idols as deities? Indeed, I see you and your people to be in manifest error.'\" <br>(Surah Al-An'am, 6:74)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Despite his father’s attempts to convince him otherwise, Ibrahim remained firm in his belief in the One True God, Allah. He began to preach monotheism to his people, urging them to abandon their false gods and turn to the worship of Allah. His people, however, rejected his message, and even his father turned against him.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Abraham's Hatred for Idols</h4>\r\n    <p>Years passed and Abraham grew. Since his childhood his heart had been full of hatred for these\r\n        idols. He could not understand how a sane person could make a statue and then worship what he\r\n        had made. He noticed that these idols did not eat, drink or talk and they could not even turn\r\n        themselves right side up if someone turned them upside down. How, then could people believe\r\n        that such statues could harm or benefit them? Abraham 's people had a big temple full of idols, in\r\n        the middle of which was a niche accommodating the biggest gods which was of different kinds,\r\n        qualities and shapes. Abraham, who used to go to the temple with his father when he was a child,\r\n        greatly despised all that wood and stone. What surprised him was the way his people behaved\r\n        when they entered the temple; they bowed and started to cry, begging and imploring their gods\r\n        for help as if the idols could hear or understand these requests!</p>\r\n    <p>At first, such a sight seemed funny to Abraham, but later he began to feel angry. Was it not\r\n        astonishing that all those people could be deceived? What added to the problem was that his\r\n        father wanted him to be a priest when he was grown. He wanted nothing more from his son that\r\n        that he revere those statues, yet Abraham never stopped displaying his hatred and disdain of them.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Abraham Discovers Allah</h4>\r\n    <p>One night Abraham left his house to go to a mountain. He walked alone in the dark until he chose\r\n        a cave in the mountain where he sat resting his back against its wall. He looked at the sky. He had\r\n        hardly seen it when he remembered that he was looking at planets and stars which were\r\n        worshipped by some people on earth. His young heart was filled with tremendous pain. He\r\n        considered what was beyond the moon, the stars and the planets (i.e. Allah) and was astonished\r\n        that these celestial bodies were worshipped by men when they had been created to worship and\r\n        obey their Creator, appearing and disappearing at His command.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <h4>Abraham Reasons with Celestial Worshippers</h4>\r\n    <p>Abraham, addressed his people who worshipped celestial bodies as Almighty Allah revealed:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he be one of those\r\n        who have Faith and certainty. When the night covered him over with darkness he saw a star. He\r\n        said: \"This is my lord.\" But when it set, he said: \"I like not that those who set.\" When he saw the\r\n        moon rising up he said: \"This is my lord.\" but when it set he said: \"Unless my Lord guides me, I\r\n        shall surely be among the erring people.\" When he saw the sun rising up he said: \"This is my\r\n        lord, This is greater.\" But when it set, he said: \"O my people! I am indeed free from all that you\r\n        join as partners in worship with Allah. Verily, I have turned my face towards Him Who has\r\n        created the heavens and the earth Hanifan (Islamic Monotheism, i.e. worshipping none but Allah\r\n        Alone) and I am not of the Al Mushrikeen (those who worship others besides Allah).\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        His people disputed with him. He said: \"Do you dispute with me concerning Allah while HE has\r\n        guided me and I fear not those whom you associate with Allah in worship. (Nothing can happen\r\n        to me) except when my Lord (Allah) wills something. My Lord comprehends in His Knowledge\r\n        all things. Will you not then remember?\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        \"And how should I fear those whom you associate in worship with Allah (though they can\r\n        neither benefit nor harm), while you fear not that you have joined in worship with Allah things\r\n        for which HE has not sent down to you any authority. So which of the two parties has more right\r\n        to be in security? If you but know.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        It is those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah and worship none but Him Alone) and confuse\r\n        not their belief with Zulm (wrong, i.e. by worshipping others besides Allah), for them only there\r\n        is security and they are the guided. And that was Our proof which We gave Abraham against his\r\n        people. We raise whom We will in degrees. Certainly your Lord is All Wise, All Knowing. (Surah\r\n        6:75-83).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>In that debate, Abraham clarified to his people that these celestial bodies do not serve as deities\r\n        and cannot be worshipped as partners with Allah the Almighty. Indeed these bodies are created\r\n        things, fashioned, controlled, managed and made to serve. They appear sometimes and disappear\r\n        at others, going out of sight from our world. However, Allah the Almighty does not lose sight of\r\n        anything, and nothing can be hidden from Him. He is without end, everlasting without\r\n        disappearance. There is no other deity but Allah.</p>\r\n    <p>Abraham made clear to them, first that the celestial bodies are unworthy of worship and second\r\n        that they are among the signs of Allah. Almighty Allah commanded:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate not\r\n        to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate to Allah Who created them if you really worship Him.\r\n        (Surah 41:37)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Ibrahim's Confrontation with His People</h2>\r\n    <p>Abraham's reasoning helped to reveal the truth, and then the conflict between him and his people\r\n        began for the worshippers of the stars and planets did not stand mute. they began arguing and\r\n        threatening Abraham.</p>\r\n    <p>Abraham replied:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Do you dispute with me concerning Allah while HE has guided me, and I fear not those whom\r\n        you associate with Allah in worship. (Nothing can happen to me except when my Lord (Allah)\r\n        wills something. My Lord comprehends in His Knowledge all things. Will you not then\r\n        remember? How should I fear those whom you associate in worship with Allah (though they can\r\n        neither benefit or harm), while you fear not that you have joined in worship with Allah things for\r\n        which He has not sent down to you any authority. SO which of the two parties has more rights to\r\n        be in security? .....if you but know! It is those who believe (in the oneness of Allah and worship\r\n        none but HiAlone) and confuse not their belief with Zulm (wrong by worshipping others besides\r\n        Allah), for them only there is security and they are the guided.\" (Surah 6:80-82)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Determined to show his people the futility of their idol worship, Ibrahim devised a plan. During a festival, when all the people were away, he entered the temple where the idols were kept. Using an axe, he destroyed all the idols except for the largest one, and then placed the axe in its hands. When the people returned and saw the destruction, they were shocked and demanded to know who was responsible.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"They said, 'Who has done this to our gods? Indeed, he is of the wrongdoers.' They said, 'We heard a young man mention them who is called Ibrahim.'\" <br>(Surah Al-Anbiya, 21:59-60)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>When Ibrahim was brought before the people, he pointed to the largest idol and suggested that they ask it who had destroyed the others. The people, realizing the absurdity of their situation, were momentarily silenced, but instead of accepting the truth, they became angry and plotted to punish Ibrahim.</p>\r\n    <p>Allah the Almighty said: they said:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Who has done this to our aliah (gods)? He must indeed be one of the wrongdoers.\" They said:\r\n        \"We heard a young man talking against them who is called Abraham.\" They said: \"Then bring\r\n        him before the eyes of the people, that they may testify.\" they said: \"Are you the one who has\r\n        done this to our gods, O Abraham?\" Abraham said: \"nay, this one, the biggest of them (idols)\r\n        did it, Ask them, if they can speak!\"So they turned to themselves and said: \"Verily you are the\r\n        Zalimun (polytheists, and wrongdoers).\" Then they turned to themselves (their first thought and\r\n        said): \"Indeed you (Abraham) know well that these idols speak not?\" Abraham said: \"DO you\r\n        then worship besides Allah, things that can neither profit you nor harm you? If upon you, and\r\n        upon that which you worship besides Allah! Have you then no sense?\" (Surah 21:59-67)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>They then realized the senselessness of their beliefs; however, their arrogance would not allow\r\n        them to admit their foolishness. All they could do was to use their power of authority as tyrants\r\n        usually do to punish Abraham. They kept him in chains and planned their revenge.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Miracle of the Fire</h2>\r\n    <p>The people decided to burn Ibrahim alive as a punishment for his actions. They gathered a large pile of wood and lit an enormous fire. Ibrahim was tied up and thrown into the fire. However, Allah commanded the fire to be cool and peaceful for Ibrahim, and by the will of Allah, he emerged from the fire unharmed.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"They said, 'Burn him and support your gods - if you are to act.' Allah said, 'O fire, be coolness and safety upon Ibrahim.'\" <br>(Surah Al-Anbiya, 21:68-69)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The fire submitted to the will of Allah, becoming cool and safe for Abraham. It only burned his\r\n        bonds, and he sat in the midst of the fire as if he were sitting in a garden. He glorified and praised\r\n        Allah the Almighty, with a heart that contained only his love for Allah. There was not any vacant\r\n        space therein for fear, awe, or worry. It was filled with love only.</p>\r\n    <p>This miraculous event astonished the people, but despite witnessing such a clear sign from Allah, most of them continued to reject Ibrahim’s message. Nevertheless, Ibrahim’s faith in Allah remained unshaken, and he continued to preach monotheism.</p>\r\n    <p>Allah declared:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Those (believers) unto whom the people (hypocrites) said: \"Verily! the people (pagans) have\r\n        gathered against you (a great army), therefore, fear them.\" but it only increased them in Faith,\r\n        and they said: Allah Alone is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs for us.\"\r\n        So they returned with Grace and Bounty from Allah. No harm touched them; and they followed\r\n        the good Pleasure of Allah. Allah is the Owner of Great bounty. It is only Satan that suggests to\r\n        you the fear of his Auliya (supporters and friends, polytheists, disbeliveers in the Oneness of\r\n        Allah and in His Messenger Muhammad) so fear them not but fear Me if you are true believers.\"\r\n        (Surah 3:173-175)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The throng, the chiefs, and the priests sad watching the fire from a distance. It was burning their\r\n        faces and nearly suffocating them. It kept burning for such a long time that the disbeliveers\r\n        thought it would never be extinguished. When it did burn out, they were greatly amazed to find\r\n        Abraham coming out of the pit untouched by the fire. Their faces were black from the smoke, but\r\n        his was bright with the light and grace of Allah. The raging fire had become cool for Abraham and\r\n        had only charred the ropes which held him. He walked out of the fire as if he were walking out of\r\n        a garden. Cries of astonishment were heard from the heathens.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"They wanted to harm him, but We made them the worst losers. (Surah 21:70)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>This miracle shamed the tyrants, but it did not cool the flame of anger in their hearts. However\r\n        after his event many of the people followed Abraham, although some kept their belief a secret for\r\n        fear of harm or death at the hands of the rulers.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Ibrahim's Journey and His Family</h2>\r\n    <p>After facing rejection from his people, Ibrahim was commanded by Allah to leave his homeland.</p>\r\n    <p>Abraham had established a definite reasoning against idolaters. Nothing was left for him except to\r\n        reason against the people who proclaimed themselves gods.</p>\r\n    <p>When the king, Namrud, heard of Abraham's safe exit from the fire he became very angry. He\r\n        feared that the status of godhead he had proclaimed for himself was not challenged by an ordinary\r\n        human being. He summoned Abraham to the palace and held a dialogue with him which Allah\r\n        Almighty recounted:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Have you not thought about him who disputed with Abraham about his Lord (Allah) because\r\n        Allah had given him the kingdom? When Abraham said to him: \"My Lord (Allah) is He Who\r\n        gives life and causes death.\" He said: \"I give life and cause death.\" Abraham said: \"Verily,\r\n        Allah causes the sun to rise from the east; then cause it you to rise from the west.\" So the\r\n        disbeliever was utterly defeated. Allah guides not the people who are Zalimeen (wrongdoers etc).\r\n        (Surah 2:258)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Abraham's fame spread throughout the entire kingdom. People talked about how he had been\r\n        saved from the blazing fire and how he had debated with the king and left him speechless. In the\r\n        meantime, Abraham continued calling people to believe in Allah, exerting a great effort to guide\r\n        his people to the right path. He tried every means to convince them. However in spite of his love\r\n        and care for his people, they felt angry and deserted him. Only one woman and one man of his\r\n        people shared his belief in Allah. The woman's name was Sarah and she became his wife. The\r\n        man's name was Lot and he became a prophet.</p>\r\n    <p>He migrated with his wife, Sarah, and his nephew, Lut (who later became a prophet) to various lands. Ibrahim traveled through a city called Ur in Bayblon, Canaan, Egypt, and finally settled in the region that is now known as Palestine. Despite his strong faith, Ibrahim and his wife Sarah faced the trial of childlessness for many years. However, Allah eventually blessed Ibrahim with a son, Ismail, from his second wife, Hajar. Later, Allah also blessed him with another son, Ishaq, from Sarah.</p>\r\n    <p>Allah the Almighty told us:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\" So Lut believed in him (Abraham's message of Islamic Monotheism). He (Abraham) said: \"I\r\n        will emigrate for the sake of my Lord. Verily, He is the All Mighty, the All Wise.\" (Surah 29:26)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Hajar and Sarah, Abraham's wife Sarah was sterile. She had been given an Egyptian woman Hajar, as a servant.\r\n        Abraham had aged and his hair was gray and after many years spent in calling people to Allah.\r\n        Sarah thought she and Abraham were lonely because she could not have a child. Therefore, she\r\n        offered her husband her servant Hajar in marriage. Hajar gave birth to her first son Ishmael\r\n        (isma'il) when Abraham was an old man.</p>\r\n    <p>Abraham lived on earth worshipping Allah and calling people to monotheism, but he was\r\n        journeying to Allah, knowing that his days on earth were limited and that they would be followed\r\n        by death and finally resurrection. The knowledge of life after death filled Abraham with peace and\r\n        love and certitude. One day he begged Allah to show him how He brought the dead back to life.\r\n        Allah commanded Abraham to take four birds, cut them up and mingle their body parts, divide\r\n        them into four portions and place them on top of four different hills, then call back the birds in\r\n        Allah's name. Abraham did as he was told. Immediately the mingled parts of the birds separated to\r\n        join their original bodies in different places and the birds flew back to Abraham.\r\n        Almighty Allah revealed:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>“Remember when Abraham said: ‘My Lord Show me how You give life to the dead.\" Allah said:\r\n        \"Do you not believe?\" Abraham said: \"Yes I believe, but to be stronger in Faith.\" HE said:\r\n        \"Take four birds, the cause them to incline towards you (then slaughter them, cut them into\r\n        pieces) and then put a portion of them on every hill and call them they will come to you in haste.\r\n        And know that Allah is All Mighty and All Wise.\"(Surah 2:260)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Building of the Kaaba</h2>\r\n    <p>One of the most significant events in Ibrahim’s life was the building of the Kaaba, the sacred House of Allah in Mecca. Allah commanded Ibrahim to take his son Ismail and Hajar to the barren valley of Mecca, leaving them there as part of a divine plan. When the time came, Ibrahim and Ismail were instructed to build the Kaaba, which would become the focal point of worship for Muslims around the world.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And [mention] when Ibrahim was raising the foundations of the House and [with him] Ismail, [saying], 'Our Lord, accept [this] from us. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing.'\" <br>(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:127)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>As they built the Kaaba, Ibrahim and Ismail prayed to Allah to accept their work and to bless their descendants with piety and guidance. This act of devotion and submission is commemorated each year by Muslims during the Hajj pilgrimage, where millions of believers visit the Kaaba to perform the sacred rites.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Test of Sacrifice</h2>\r\n    <p>One of the greatest tests of Ibrahim’s faith came when Allah commanded him in a dream to sacrifice his beloved son, Ismail. Although this was a difficult command, both Ibrahim and Ismail were ready to submit to the will of Allah. When Ibrahim informed his son of the divine command, Ismail, showing remarkable faith, encouraged his father to carry out the command:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"He said, 'O my father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, if Allah wills, of the steadfast.'\" <br>(Surah As-Saffat, 37:102)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>As Ibrahim prepared to sacrifice his son, Allah, in His mercy, sent a ram to be sacrificed in Ismail’s place, and both father and son were rewarded for their submission and obedience. This event is commemorated every year during the festival of Eid al-Adha, where Muslims around the world perform the ritual sacrifice of an animal in remembrance of Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son for the sake of Allah.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Ibrahim’s Legacy</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Ibrahim’s life is filled with profound lessons of faith, patience, and submission to the will of Allah. His unwavering belief in the Oneness of Allah, his willingness to challenge the idolatry of his people, and his readiness to sacrifice everything for the sake of Allah make him a model for believers throughout history.</p>\r\n    <p>Ibrahim is known as the father of prophets, as both of his sons, Ismail and Ishaq, became prophets. His descendants include some of the greatest prophets, including Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who was sent as the final messenger to all of humanity. Ibrahim’s legacy of monotheism is central to the Abrahamic faiths, and his name is mentioned with honor in the Quran, the Torah, and the Bible.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Lessons from Prophet Ibrahim’s Story</h2>\r\n    <p>The story of Prophet Ibrahim teaches us several important lessons. First, it reminds us of the importance of unwavering faith in Allah, even in the face of adversity. Ibrahim’s trust in Allah never wavered, whether he was thrown into the fire, commanded to sacrifice his son, or called to build the Kaaba in a barren land.</p>\r\n    <p>Second, the story emphasizes the importance of submission to Allah’s will. Ibrahim’s life was a continuous test of his faith, and each time he passed the test with complete submission. His willingness to sacrifice his most beloved possessions for the sake of Allah is a reminder that true faith requires selflessness and complete trust in Allah’s wisdom.</p>\r\n    <p>Finally, Ibrahim’s legacy serves as a reminder of the power of dua (prayer) and patience. Ibrahim prayed to Allah for righteous offspring, and although it took many years, Allah blessed him with both Ismail and Ishaq, who became prophets. His story teaches us that Allah’s plans are always best, and that patience and persistence in prayer will lead to divine blessings.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n"},{"Id":9,"LanguageCode":"en","TranslatedName":"Ishmael","ArabicName":"إسماعيل","ArabicTransliteratedName":"Isma'il","AudioFileName":"9.mp3","SourceHtml":"<body>\r\n    <p><strong>Prophet Ishmael (peace be upon him)</strong>, known as Isma'il in Arabic, was the son of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) and Hajar. His life is integral to Islamic history and tradition, with his story reflecting deep themes of faith, sacrifice, and divine providence. Ishmael is celebrated for his role in the establishment of Mecca and the rites of Hajj, which are central to Islamic worship.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Birth and Early Life of Ishmael</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Ishmael was born in a time of significant trials for his father, Ibrahim. After many years of waiting and despite advanced age, Allah granted Ibrahim a son through Hajar, his second wife. This event was a fulfillment of Allah’s promise to Ibrahim, who had been tested repeatedly throughout his life.</p>\r\n    <p>One day, Abraham woke up and asked his wife Hajar to get her son and prepare for a long\r\n        journey. In a few days Abraham started out with his wife Hajar and their son Ishmael. The child\r\n        was still nursing and not yet weaned. Abraham walked through cultivated land, desert, and\r\n        mountains until he reached the desert of the Arabian Peninsula and came to an uncultivated valley\r\n        having no fruit, no trees, no food, no water. The valley had no sign of life. After Abraham had\r\n        helped his wife and child to dismount, he left them with a small amount of food and water which\r\n        was hardly enough for 2 days. He turned around and walked away. He wife hurried after him\r\n        asking: \"Where are you going Abrahim, leaving us in this barren valley?\"</p>\r\n    <p>Abraham did not answer her, but continued walking. She repeated what she had said, but he\r\n        remained silent. Finally she understood that he was not acting on his own initiative. she realized\r\n        that Allah had commanded him to do this. She asked him : \"Did Allah command you to do so?\"\r\n        He replied: \"Yes.\" Then his great wife said: \"We are not going to be lost, since Allah Who has\r\n        commanded you is with us.\"\r\n        Abraham invoked Almighty Allah thus:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"O Our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in a valley with no cultivation, by Your\r\n        Sacred House (the Ka'ba at Mecca); in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayers perfectly\r\n        (Iqamat as salat) so fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and O Allah provide\r\n        them with fruits so that they may give thanks. O our Lord! Certainly, You know what we conceal\r\n        and what we reveal. Nothing on the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah.\" (Surah 14:37-38)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Hajar and Ishmael were left in the barren valley of Mecca by Ibrahim, following Allah's command.</p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Abbas narrated: \"The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so\r\n        that she might hide her tracks from Sarah (by dragging it). Abraham brought her and her son\r\n        Ishmael while she was suckling him to a place near the Kaba under a tree on the spot of ZamZam\r\n        at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there\r\n        any water so he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some\r\n        dates and a small water skin containing some water and set out homeward. Ishmael's mother\r\n        followed him saying:</p>\r\n    <p>\"O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose\r\n        company we may enjoy, nor is there anything to enjoy?\" she repeated that to him many times, but\r\n        he did not look back at her. Then she asked him : \"Has Allah ordered you to do so?\" He said:\r\n        \"Yes.\" She then said: \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Abraham proceeded\r\n        onwards. On reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Kaba and raising\r\n        both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your\r\n        Sacred House (Kaba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill\r\n        some hearts among men with love towards them, and O Allah provide them with fruits so that\r\n        they may give thanks.\" (Surah 14:37)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Ibn Abbas's narration continued; \"Ishmael's mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from\r\n        the water (she had) When the water in the water skin had been used up, she became thirsty and\r\n        her child also became thirsty, She started looking at him (Ishmael) tossing in agony. She left him,\r\n        for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of As-Safa was the nearest\r\n        mountain to her on that land. she too on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she\r\n        might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended for As Safa and when\r\n        she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and\r\n        trouble till she crossed the valley and reached the mountain of Al Marwa. There she stood and\r\n        started looking expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that\r\n        running between Safa And Marwa seven times.\"</p>\r\n    <p>Hajar sees Zam-zam - by Prophet Muhammad:</p>\r\n    <p>The prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: \"This is the source of the tradition of the Sa'y (rituals of the\r\n        hajj, pilgrimage) the going of people between them (As-Safa and Al-Marwa). When she reached\r\n        Al Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened\r\n        attentively. She heard the voice again and said: \"O whoever you maybe! You have made me hear\r\n        your voice; have you got something to help me?\" And behold! She saw an angel at the place of\r\n        Zam zam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing) till water flowed from that place. She\r\n        started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her\r\n        water skin with water with her hands and the water was flowing out water she had scooped some\r\n        of it.\" The Prophet (pbuh) added: \"May Allah bestow mercy on Ishmael's mother! Had she let the\r\n        zam-zam flow without trying to control it, or had she not scooped from that water to fill her\r\n        water skin, Zam zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\"</p>\r\n    <p>The Prophet (pbuh) continued: \"Then she drank water and suckled her child. The angel said to\r\n        her: \"Don't be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this\r\n        boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people.\" The House (Kaba) at that time was on a\r\n        high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. \"She\r\n        lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her\r\n        and her child as they (the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada. they landed in\r\n        the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not\r\n        leaving it. they said: \"this bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no\r\n        water in this valley.\" They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water and\r\n        returned to inform them of the water. So they all came towards the water. Ishmael's mother was\r\n        sitting near the water. They asked her: \"Do you allow us to stay with you?\" She replied: \"Yes, but\r\n        you will have no right to possess the water.\" They agreed to that. Ishmael's mother was pleased\r\n        with the whole situation, as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people, so they settled\r\n        there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some\r\n        families became permanent residents there. The child (Ishmael) grew up and learned Arabic from\r\n        them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up and when he reached\r\n        the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them.\"</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>In the harsh environment of Mecca, the provisions brought by Ibrahim soon ran out. Hajar, desperate to find water for her infant son, ran seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwah. Her perseverance was rewarded when the angel Jibril (Gabriel) struck the earth with his wing, causing the Zamzam well to spring forth. This miraculous event marked the beginning of Mecca as a place of blessing and sustenance.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Ishmael's Wives</h2>\r\n    <p>The Prophet (pbuh) continued: \"After Ishmael's mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmael's\r\n        marriage in order to see his family that he had left before but he did not find Ishmael there. When\r\n        he asked Ishmael's wife about him, she replied: \"He has gone in search of livelihood.\" Then he\r\n        asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, \"We are living in misery;\r\n        we are living in hardship and destitution,\" complaining to him. He said: \"When your husband\r\n        returns, convey my salutations to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his\r\n        house).\"</p>\r\n    <p>When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife: \"Has\r\n        anyone visited you?\" she replied, \"Yes, an old man of such and such description came and asked\r\n        me about you and I informed him and he asked about our state of living and I told him that we\r\n        were living in a hardship and poverty.\" On that Ishmael said: \"Did he advise you anything?\" She\r\n        said: \"Yes he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of\r\n        your gate.\" Ishmael said: \"It was my father and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to\r\n        your family.\" So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from among them (Jurhum).</p>\r\n    <P>\"Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them\r\n        again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael's wife and asked her about Ishmael. She\r\n        said: 'he has gone in sof our livelihood.' Abraham asked her; 'how are you getting on?' asking her\r\n        about their sustenance and living. she replied: 'we are prosperous and well off (we have everything\r\n        in abundance).' then she thanked Allah. Abraham said: 'What kind of food do you eat?' she said:\r\n        'meat.' he said: 'what do you drink?' she said: 'water.' he said: 'O Allah! bless their meat and\r\n        water.\"</P>\r\n    <p>The Prophet (pbuh) added: \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain he would\r\n        have also invoked Allah to bless it. If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his\r\n        health and disposition will be badly affected unless he lives in Mecca.\"</p>\r\n    <p>The Prophet (pbuh) continued: \"Then Abraham said to Ishmael's wife: 'When your husband\r\n        comes give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.'\r\n        When Ishmael came back he asked his wife, 'did anyone call no you?' she replied: 'yes, a good\r\n        looking old man came to me,' so she praised him and added: 'He asked about you and I informed\r\n        him that we were in a good condition.' Ishmael asked her:' did he give you any piece of advice?'\r\n        she said; 'yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the\r\n        threshold of your gate.' on that Ishmael said: 'It was my father, and you are the threshold of the\r\n        gate. He has ordered me to keep you with me.'</p>\r\n    <p>Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them\r\n        afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zam Zam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw\r\n        Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or\r\n        a son does with his father). Abraham said: 'O Ishmael! Allah has give me an order.' Ishmael said:\r\n        'Do what your Lord has ordered you to do.' Abraham asked:'Will you help me?' Ishmael said: 'I\r\n        will help you.' Abraham said: 'Allah has ordered me to build a house here,' pointing to a hillock\r\n        higher than the land surrounding it.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Role of Ishmael in the Building of the Kaaba</h2>\r\n    <p>As Ishmael grew, he assisted his father Ibrahim in constructing the Kaaba, which was the first House of Worship built for the worship of Allah alone. The construction of the Kaaba was a pivotal moment in Islamic history, symbolizing the establishment of monotheistic worship and a sacred place for future generations.</p>\r\n    <p>The process of building the Kaaba was both a physical and spiritual undertaking. Ibrahim and Ishmael worked diligently to lay the foundations of this sacred structure. Allah commanded them to build it in a way that honored His guidance and provided a place where believers from all over the world would gather in worship.</p>\r\n    <p>\"Then they raised the foundations of the House (the Kaba). Ishmael brought the stones while\r\n        Abraham built and when the walls became high Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham\r\n        who stood over it and carried on building. While Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of\r\n        them were saying:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And [mention] when Ibrahim was raising the foundations of the House and [with him] Ismail, [saying], 'Our Lord, accept [this] from us. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing.'\" <br>(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:127)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The Kaaba became the focal point of the Islamic faith, and the rites associated with it, including the pilgrimage (Hajj), were established as acts of worship that continue to this day. The building of the Kaaba by Ibrahim and Ishmael stands as a testament to their obedience and devotion to Allah.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Sacrifice of Ishmael</h2>\r\n    <p>One of the most profound tests faced by Prophet Ibrahim was the command from Allah to sacrifice his beloved son, Ishmael. This test was a significant demonstration of faith and obedience. Ibrahim received this command in a dream, which he understood as a divine instruction.</p>\r\n    <p>In a remarkable display of faith, both Ibrahim and Ishmael accepted the command with submission. Ishmael, although a young boy, showed incredible patience and trust in Allah’s plan. He encouraged his father to proceed with the sacrifice, understanding that it was a test of their devotion:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"He said, 'O my father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, if Allah wills, of the steadfast.'\" <br>(Surah As-Saffat, 37:102)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>As Ibrahim prepared to carry out the sacrifice, Allah’s mercy was revealed. An angel sent by Allah provided a ram to be sacrificed in place of Ishmael. This act of substitution was a sign of Allah’s grace and a reward for the unwavering faith of both father and son. The event is commemorated annually during Eid al-Adha, where Muslims around the world perform the ritual sacrifice of an animal in remembrance of Ibrahim and Ishmael’s willingness to submit to Allah’s will.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Ishmael's Legacy and Contributions</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Ishmael's contributions to Islamic history are immense. His role in the establishment of the Kaaba and the associated rites of Hajj are central to Islamic worship. The well of Zamzam, which continues to provide water to millions of pilgrims each year, is a lasting symbol of divine provision and mercy.</p>\r\n    <p>Ishmael’s descendants include some of the most revered figures in Islamic history. Among them is the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who is a direct descendant of Ishmael. This lineage underscores the importance of Ishmael’s role in the prophetic tradition and the continuation of the monotheistic message through his descendants.</p>\r\n    <p>The rites of Hajj, including the walking between Safa and Marwah, are performed in memory of Hajar’s search for water and Ishmael’s role in establishing Mecca as a sacred place. These rites are a testament to the enduring legacy of Prophet Ishmael and his family’s contributions to Islamic worship and spirituality.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Lessons from Prophet Ishmael’s Story</h2>\r\n    <p>The story of Prophet Ishmael provides profound lessons in faith, obedience, and perseverance. His life illustrates the importance of trusting in Allah’s plan, even in the face of great trials. The willingness to sacrifice and the ability to remain steadfast under pressure are key themes in his story.</p>\r\n    <p>The annual commemoration of Eid al-Adha serves as a reminder of these values. Muslims around the world reflect on the principles of sacrifice, submission, and faith exemplified by Ibrahim and Ishmael. The story encourages believers to trust in Allah’s wisdom and to remain committed to their faith through all challenges.</p>\r\n    <p>Furthermore, the story highlights the significance of establishing places of worship and maintaining spiritual traditions. The Kaaba and the rites of Hajj are central to Islamic practice, serving as enduring symbols of faith and devotion that continue to guide and inspire millions of Muslims around the world.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n"},{"Id":10,"LanguageCode":"en","TranslatedName":"Isaac","ArabicName":"إسحاق","ArabicTransliteratedName":"Ishaq","AudioFileName":"10.mp3","SourceHtml":"<body>\r\n    <p><strong>Prophet Ishaq (peace be upon him)</strong>, known as Isaac in the Bible, was the son of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) and his wife Sarah. Ishaq is a significant figure in Islamic tradition and is honored for his role as a prophet and his place in the lineage of subsequent prophets, including Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). His life and legacy are integral to understanding the continuity of prophetic teachings and the divine message.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Birth of Ishaq</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Ishaq was born to Ibrahim and Sarah at a time when they were advanced in age and had despaired of having children. His birth was a miracle and a fulfillment of Allah’s promise to Ibrahim, who had been assured that he would have a righteous son. The announcement of Ishaq’s birth was made by angels who visited Ibrahim and gave him the good news.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"They said, 'Do not be afraid. We give you good tidings of a boy who will be a scholar. And We give you tidings of the truth of His word: 'The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary.' \" <br>(Surah Al-Hijr, 15:53)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>His birth was a source of immense joy and a sign of Allah’s power and mercy. The name “Ishaq” means “laughter” in Arabic, reflecting the happiness that his birth brought to his parents, who had long awaited this blessing.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Ishaq’s Life and Prophethood</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Ishaq grew up to be a righteous and devout individual, continuing the legacy of his father, Ibrahim.

Yaqub, known for his steadfast faith and patience, had twelve sons, one of whom was Yusuf (Joseph), whose story is well-known for its lessons in patience and perseverance.</p>\r\n    <p>Yaqub’s life was marked by trials and tribulations, including the loss and eventual reunion with his son Yusuf. The story of Yaqub and his family highlights the themes of faith, trust in Allah, and the importance of familial bonds in the prophetic tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Divine Promise and Legacy</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Ishaq’s life and mission were part of the divine promise made to Ibrahim. Allah had promised Ibrahim that his descendants would be numerous and that they would carry forward the message of monotheism. Ishaq was a crucial part of this promise, and his descendants continued the prophetic lineage.</p>\r\n    <p>The legacy of Prophet Ishaq is reflected in the continuity of the prophetic message through his descendants. The teachings of Ishaq and his family were in alignment with the monotheistic message of Ibrahim, and they played a key role in shaping the spiritual and moral foundations of their communities.</p>\r\n    <p>Prophet Ishaq’s story also emphasizes the importance of family in the context of divine mission.

Yusuf was the beloved son of Yaqub, which caused jealousy among his other sons. This jealousy led to a series of tragic events that tested Yaqub’s patience and faith.</p>\r\n    <p>The story of Yusuf is detailed in the Quran and highlights themes of patience, trust in Allah, and the ultimate triumph of righteousness. Yusuf’s brothers, envious of their father’s affection for him, conspired to throw him into a well and deceive their father into believing Yusuf had been killed by a wild animal. This act of treachery caused Yaqub immense grief.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And [mention] when the caravan departed, their father said, 'Indeed, I find the smell of Yusuf, if not you think me weak in mind.'\" <br>(Surah Yusuf, 12:94)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Yaqub’s patience and reliance on Allah’s plan are evident as he endured years of separation from Yusuf, believing in Allah’s promise and justice. Eventually, Yusuf was found and brought back to his family, and his story is a powerful example of divine justice and the importance of maintaining faith in difficult times.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Trials and Patience</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Yaqub faced numerous trials throughout his life, not only with the loss of Yusuf but also with the challenges of raising his children and maintaining his faith amidst adversity. His patience and unwavering belief in Allah’s wisdom were pivotal in overcoming these challenges.</p>\r\n    <p>Despite the hardships, Yaqub never lost hope or questioned Allah’s wisdom. His story is a testament to the virtue of patience and the importance of maintaining trust in Allah even when faced with seemingly insurmountable difficulties.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Prophet Yaqub’s Legacy</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Yaqub’s legacy is reflected in the lessons from his life, particularly in the way he handled trials with patience and faith. His story teaches the importance of perseverance, trust in Allah, and the strength of family bonds. His sons, including Yusuf, played crucial roles in the continuation of prophetic teachings and the development of the Israelite tribes.</p>\r\n    <p>Yaqub’s story is also a reminder of the power of divine justice.

His story is detailed in Surah Yusuf (Chapter 12 of the Quran), which is renowned for its narrative structure and moral lessons. Yusuf’s life is a tale of profound trials, steadfastness, and divine wisdom, reflecting the virtues of patience, trust in Allah, and forgiveness.</p>\r\n    <p>This is the most detailed and fascinating story in the Quran, involving both human weaknesses\r\n        such as jealousy, hatred, pride, passion, deception, intrigue, cruelty, and terror as well as noble\r\n        qualities such as patience, loyalty, bravery, nobility, and compassion.\r\n        It is related that among the reasons for its revelation is that the Jews asked the Prophet\r\n        Muhammad (pbuh) to tell them about Joseph (pbuh) who was one of their old prophets. His story\r\n        had been distorted in parts and marred in others with interpolation and exclusions. Therefore it\r\n        was revealed in the Book of Allah (Quran), complete in its minute and careful details. Allah the Almighty declared:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"We relate unto you (Muhammad) the best of stories through Our Revelations unto you, of this\r\n        Quran. And before this (i.e. before the coming of Divine Inspiration to you), you were among\r\n        those who knew nothing about it (the Quran). (Surah 12:3)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Thus We relate to you (O Muhammad) some information of what happened before, And indeed\r\n        We have give you from Us a Reminder (this Quran). Whoever turns away from it (this\r\n        Quran--i.e. does not believe in it, nor acts on its orders), verily they will bear a heavy burden (of\r\n        sins) on the Day of Resurrection. They will abide in that (state in the Fire of Hell), and evil\r\n        indeed will it be that load for them on the Day of Resurrection.(Surah 20:99-101)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The story of Yusuf (pbuh) moves in a stream from beginning to end; its substance and form are\r\n        equally coherent. It inspires you with a feeling for the depth of Allah's power and supremacy and\r\n        the execution of His rulings despite the challenge of human intervention.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And Allah has full power and control over His Affairs, but most of men know not. (Surah 12:21)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Early Life and Dreams of Yusuf</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Yusuf was the beloved son of Prophet Yaqub (peace be upon him) and his wife Rachel. His father’s affection for him was well-known, which unfortunately sowed seeds of jealousy among his eleven brothers. Yusuf’s beauty and prophetic dreams further fueled their envy.</p>\r\n    <p>In one of his dreams, Yusuf saw eleven stars, the sun, and the moon prostrating to him. He shared this dream with his father, who interpreted it as a sign of Yusuf’s future prominence and the eventual submission of his family to him.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"When Yusuf said to his father, 'O my father, indeed I have seen [in a dream] [that] eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me.'\" <br>(Surah Yusuf, 12:4)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>His father's face lit up. He foresaw that Joseph would be one through whom the prophecy of his\r\n        grandfather, Prophet Abraham (pbuh), would be fulfilled, in that his offspring would keep the\r\n        light of Abraham's house alive and spread Allah's message to mankind.\r\n        Therefore, it was narrated that Allah's Messenger Muhammad (pbuh) was asked: \"Who is the\r\n        most honorable amongst the people?\" He replied: \"The most God-fearing.\" The people said: \"We\r\n        do not want to ask you about this.\" He said: \"The most honorable person is Joseph Allah's\r\n        prophet, the son of Allah's prophet, the son of the faithful friend of Allah (Abraham).\" (Sahih\r\n        Al-Bukhari) However, the father was well aware of the jealousy of Joseph's brothers, so he\r\n        warned him against telling his dream to his brothers.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"O my son! Relate not your vision to your brothers, lest they arrange a plot against you. Verily!\r\n        Satan is to man an open enemy! Thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation\r\n        of dreams (an other things) and perfect His Favor on you and on the offspring of Jacob, as He\r\n        perfected it on your fathers, Abraham, and Isaac aforetime! Verily! your Lord is All-Knowing,\r\n        All-Wise.\" (Surah 12:5-6)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>This dream symbolized Yusuf’s future role and the significant events that would unfold, reflecting Allah’s plan for his life.</p>\r\n    <p>Joseph heeded his father's warning. He did not tell his brothers what he had seen. It is well known\r\n        that they hated him so much that it was difficult for him to feel secure telling them what was in his\r\n        heart and in his dreams.</p>\r\n    <p>Joseph was eighteen years old, very handsome and robust, with a gentle temperament. He was\r\n        respectful, kind and considerate. His brother Benjamin was equally pleasant. Both were from one\r\n        mother, Rachel. Because of their refined qualities, the father loved the two more than his other\r\n        children, and would not let them out of his sight. To protect them, he kept them busy with work\r\n        in the house garden.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Plot Against Yusuf</h2>\r\n    <p>Driven by jealousy and anger, Yusuf’s brothers devised a plan to get rid of him. They initially intended to kill him but later decided to throw him into a well, hoping he would be found and taken away by a passing caravan. They took Yusuf’s shirt, stained it with blood, and presented it to their father, falsely claiming that Yusuf had been devoured by a wild animal.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Truly, Joseph and his brother (Benjamin) are loved more by our father than we, but we are\r\n        Usbah (a strong group). Really our father is in a plain error. Kill Joseph or cast him out to some\r\n        other land, so that the favor of your father may be give to you alone, and after that you will be\r\n        righteous folk (by intending repentance before committing the sin).\"\r\n        One from among them said: \"Kill not Joseph, but if you must do something, throw him down to\r\n        the bottom of a well, he will be picked up by some caravan of travelers.\" (Surah 12:8-10)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Yusuf was found by a caravan and sold into slavery in Egypt, where he was purchased by a high-ranking official. His father, Prophet Yaqub, was heartbroken and grieved deeply, but he held onto his faith and trust in Allah. The Quran describes this scene as follows:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And there came a caravan of travelers; they sent their water drawer, and he let down his bucket\r\n        into the well. He said: \"What a good news! Here is a boy.\" So they hid him as merchandise (a\r\n        slave). And Allah was the All Knower of what they did.\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        They sold him for a low price, for a few Dhirhams (for a few silver coins). They were of those\r\n        who regarded him insignificant.\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        He (the man) from Egypt who bought him said to his wife: \"Make his stay comfortable, may be\r\n        he will profit us or we shall adopt him as a son.\" Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that\r\n        We might teach him the interpretation of events. (Surah 12:19-21)\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        See how Allah the Almighty reveals the substance of this long story from its beginning: And Allah\r\n        has full power and control over His Affairs, but most of men know not. (Surah 12:21)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Trials in the House of the Aziz</h2>\r\n    <p>What we see as hazards and slander is the first step of the ladder on Joseph's way to greatness.\r\n        Allah is decisive in His action. His plan is carried out despite the plans of others and while theirs\r\n        are still being made. So He spoils their plan, and Allah's promise is realized. Allah has promise\r\n        Joseph prophethood. Love for Joseph was thrust into the heart of the man who bought him, and\r\n        he was a man of no mean position. He was an important personage, one of the ruling class of\r\n        Egypt.</p>\r\n    <p>In Egypt, Yusuf was employed in the household of the Aziz (the official’s wife). Yusuf’s exemplary character and integrity made him well-respected, but he faced a severe trial when the Aziz’s wife, Zulaikha, attempted to seduce him. Yusuf resisted her advances, demonstrating remarkable self-control and adherence to moral principles. Zulaikha, watched Joseph from day to day. She at with him, talked with him, listened to him, and her wonder increased over the passion of time.</p>\r\n    <p>Joseph was soon confronted (with his second trial). The chief minister's wife, Zulaikha could not\r\n        resist the handsome Joseph, and her obsession with him caused her sleepless nights. She fell in\r\n        love with him, and it was painful for her to be so close to a man, yet be unable to hold him. Yet,\r\n        she was not a wayward woman, for in her position she could get any man she desired. By all\r\n        accounts, she must have been a very pretty and intelligent lady, or why would the chief minister\r\n        have chosen her of all the pretty women in the kingdom? Although she bore him no child, he\r\n        would not take another wife, as he loved her passionately.The Quran raises the curtain on the\r\n        scene of this fierce and devouring love on the part of the lady. Allah the Almighty told us:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him (to do an evil act), she closed the doors\r\n        and said: \"come on, O you.\" He said: \"I seek refuge in Allah (or Allah forbid)! Truly he (your\r\n        husband) is my master! He made my stay agreeable! (So I will never betray him). Verily, the\r\n        Zalimun (wrong, evildoers) will never be successful.\" Indeed she did desire him and he would\r\n        have inclined to her desire had he not seen the evidence of his Lord. Thus it was, that We might\r\n        turn away from evil and illegal sexual intercourse. Surely, he was one of Our chosen, guided\r\n        slaves. (Surah 12:23-24)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Joseph's refusal only heightened her passion. As he moved to the door to escape, she ran after him\r\n        and caught hold of his shirt, like a drowning person clinging to the boat. In her tugging she tore\r\n        his shirt and held the torn piece in her hand. They reached the door together. It opened suddenly,\r\n        there stood her husband and a relative of hers.\r\n        Almighty Allah said:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"So they raced with one another to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back. They both\r\n        found her lord (her husband) at the door. (Surah 12:25)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>As he opened the door, he saw her husband standing in front of him. The sly woman immediately\r\n        changed her tone to anger, and, showing the torn piece of the shirt in her hand, asked her\r\n        husband:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"What is the recompense (punishment) for him who intended an evil design against your wife,\r\n        except that he be put in prison or a painful torment?\" (Surah 12:25)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>She was now accusing Joseph of molesting her, to give the impression that she was innocent and\r\n        a victim of Joseph's sexual desire. Though bewildered Joseph denied it</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"It was she that sought to seduce me.\" (Surah 12:26)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The shirt was passed from hand to hand, while she watched. The witness (her cousin) looked at it\r\n        and found that it was torn at the back. The evidence showed that she was guilty. The disappointed\r\n        husband remarked to his wife:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Surely, it is a plot of you women! Certainly mighty is you plot!\"\r\n        (Surah 12:28)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>That evening, Zulaikha convinced her husband that the only way to save her honor was to put\r\n        Joseph in prison; otherwise she would not be able to control herself or to safeguard his prestige.\r\n        The chief minister knew Joseph was absolutely innocent, that he was a young man of honor, a\r\n        loyal servant, and he loved him for these reasons. It was not an easy decision for him to put an\r\n        innocent man behind bars. However, he was left with no choice. He reasoned that Joseph's honor\r\n        would also be safeguarded if he was kept out of Zulaikha's sight. That night, with a heavy heart,\r\n        the chief minister sent Joseph to prison.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"He said, 'My Lord, prison is more dear to me than what they invite me to. And if You do not avert from me their plan, I might incline toward them and [thus] be among the ignorant.'\" <br>(Surah Yusuf, 12:33)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Joseph's Time in Prison</h2>\r\n    <p>Prison was Joseph's third test. During this period Allah blessed him with an extraordinary gift; the\r\n        ability to interpret dreams. At about the same time two other men landed in the prison. One was\r\n        the cupbearer of the king; the other was the king's cook. The two men sensed that Joseph was not\r\n        a common criminal, for an aura of piety glowed on his face. Both men had vivid dreams, and they\r\n        were anxious to have them explained. The king's cook dreamed that he stood in a place with\r\n        bread on his head, and two birds were eating the bread. The cupbearer dreamed that he was\r\n        serving the king wine. The two went to Joseph and told him their dreams, asking him to give them\r\n        their meaning.</p>\r\n    <p>First, Joseph called them to Allah. Then he said that the cook would be crucified until he died and\r\n        that the cupbearer would return to the service of the king. Joseph told the cupbearer to remember\r\n        him to the king and to say that there was a wronged soul called Joseph in prison. What Joseph\r\n        predicted did happen; the cook was crucified and the cupbearer returned to the palace.</p>\r\n    <p>After the cupbearer returned to service, Satan made him forget to mention Joseph's name to the\r\n        king. Therefore, Joseph remained in prison for a few years, but he made patience his own, praying\r\n        to Allah. Almighty Allah narrated:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And there entered with him two young men in the prison. One of them said: \"Verily, I saw\r\n        myself (in a dream) pressing wine.\" The other said: \"Verily, I saw myself (in a dream) carrying\r\n        bread on my head and birds were eating thereof.\" They said: Inform us of the interpretation of\r\n        this. Verily, we think you are one of those Muhsineen (doers of good).\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        He said: \"No food will come to you (in wakefulness or in dream) as your provision but I will\r\n        inform (in wakefulness) its interpretation before it (the food) comes. This is of that which my\r\n        Lord has taught me. Verily, I have abandoned the religion of a people that believe not in Allah\r\n        and are disbeliveers in the Hereafter. And I have followed the religion of my fathers, - Abraham,\r\n        Isaac, and Jacob and never could we attribute any partners whatsoever to Allah. This is from the\r\n        Grace of Allah to us and to mankind, but most men think not (i.e. they neither believe in Allah\r\n        nor worship Him).\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        \"O two companions of the prison! Are many different lords (gods) better or Allah, the One, the\r\n        Irresistible? You do not worship besides Him but only names which you have named (forged),\r\n        you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. The command (or the\r\n        judgment) is for none but Allah. He has commanded (His Monotheism), that is the true, straight\r\n        religion, but most men know not.\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        \"O two companions of the prison! As for one of you, he (as a servant) will pour out wine for his\r\n        lord (King or master) to drink; and as for the other, he will be crucified and birds will eat from\r\n        his head. Thus is the case judged concerning which you both did inquire.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        And he said to the one whom he knew to be saved: \"Mention me to your lord (your King, so to\r\n        get me out of the prison).\" But Satan made him forget to mention it to his lord (or Satan made\r\n        Joseph to forget the remembrance of his Lord (Allah) as to ask for His Help, instead of others).\r\n        So Joseph stayed in prison a few more years. (Surah 12:36-42).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <p>The king is\r\n        asleep. He sees himself on the banks of the Nile river. The water is receding before him, becoming\r\n        mere mud. The fish begin to skip and jump in the mud. Seven fat cows come out of the river\r\n        followed by seven lean cows. The seven lean ones devour the seven fat ones. The king is terrified.\r\n        The seven ears of green grain grow on the riverbanks and disappear in the mud. One the same\r\n        spot grow seven dray ears of grain.\r\n        The king awoke frightened, shocked, and depressed, not knowing what all this meant. He sent for\r\n        the sorcerers, priests and ministers, and told them his dream.\r\n        The sorcerers said: \"This is a mixed up dream. How can any of that be? It is a nightmare.\"\r\n        The priests said: \"Perhaps his majesty had a heavy supper.\"\r\n        The chief minister said: \"Could it be that his majesty was exposed and did not draw the blanket up\r\n        at night?\"\r\n        The king's jester said, jokingly: \"His majesty is beginning to grow old, and so his dreams are\r\n        confused.\"\r\n        They reached an unanimous conclusion that it was only a nightmare.\r\n        The news reached the cupbearer. He recollected the dream he had in prison and compared it to\r\n        the king's dream, and, therefore Joseph came to mind. He ran to the king to tell him about Joseph,\r\n        who was the only one capable to interpreting the dream. The cupbearer said : \"He had asked me\r\n        to remember him to you, but I forgot.\" The king sent the cupbearer to ask Joseph about the\r\n        dream.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Joseph's Innocence Proved</h2>\r\n    <p>Yusuf interpreted the Kings dream as a prophecy of seven years of prosperity followed by seven years of famine. He also advised the King on how to prepare for the upcoming years of scarcity. Impressed by Yusuf’s wisdom and insight, the King appointed him as a high official responsible for managing Egypt’s resources during the years of abundance and famine.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And [Joseph] said, 'You will plant for seven years consecutively. And what you harvest, leave in the ear except a little from which you will eat.'\" <br>(Surah Yusuf, 12:47)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The king was greatly astonished. Who could this person be? He commanded that Joseph be set\r\n        free from prison and presented to him at once. The king's envoy went to fetch him immediately,\r\n        but Joseph refused to leave the prison unless his innocence was proven. Perhaps they accused him\r\n        of cutting the ladies hands, or trying to rape them. Perhaps any other false accusation was made.\r\n        We do not know exactly what was said to the people to justify Joseph's sentence to prison. The\r\n        envoy returned to the king. The king asked him: \"Where is Joseph? Did I not command you to\r\n        fetch him?\"</p>\r\n    <p>The envoy replied: \"He refused to leave until his innocence is established regarding the ladies who\r\n        cut their hands.\"</p>\r\n    <p>The king ordered: \"Bring the wives of the ministers and the wife of the chief minister at once.\"\r\n        The king felt that Joseph had been harmed unfairly but he did not know exactly how. The wife of\r\n        the chief minister came with the other ministers' wives. The king asked: \"What is the story of\r\n        Joseph? What do you know about him? Is it true that…?\"</p>\r\n    <p>One of the ladies interrupted the king exclaiming: \"Allah forbid!\" A second said: \"We know of no evil he has done.\" A third said: \"He enjoys the innocence of angels.\" The eyes of everyone turned to the wife of the chief minister. She now wore a wrinkled face and\r\n        had lost weight. She had been overwhelmed by sorrow over Joseph while he was in prison. She\r\n        boldly confessed that she had lied and he had told the truth. \"I tempted him; but he refused.\" She confirmed what she said, not out of fear of the king or the other ladies, but for Joseph to know that she had never betrayed him during his absence, for he was still in her mind and soul. Of all creation he was the only one she cared for, so she confirmed his innocence before all. Almighty Allah said:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>And the king said: \"Bring him to me.\" But, when the messenger came to him\r\n        (Joseph) said: \"Return to your lord, and ask him, 'what happened to the women who cut their\r\n        hands? Surely, my Lord (Allah) is Well Aware of their plot.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        (The king) said (to the women): \"What was your affair when you did seek to seduce Joseph?\" The\r\n        women said: \"Allah forbid! No evil know we against him!\" The wife of Al Aziz said: \"Now the\r\n        truth is manifest to all, it was I who sought to seduce him and he is surely one of the truthful.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        (Then Joseph said: \"I asked for this inquiry) in order that he (Al-Aziz) may know that I betrayed\r\n        him not in secret. And, verily! Allah guides not the plot of the betrayers. And I free not myself\r\n        (from the blame). Verily, the human self is inclined to evil, except when my Lord bestows His\r\n        Mercy (upon whom He wills). Verily, my Lord is Oft-Forgiving, most Merciful.\" (Surah 12:50-53).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The king informed Joseph that his innocence was established and ordered him to come to the\r\n        palace for an interview. The king recognized his noble qualities. When Joseph came, the king\r\n        spoke to him in his tongue. Joseph's replies astonished the king with his cultural refinement and\r\n        wide knowledge.\r\n        Then the conversation turned to the dream. Joseph advised the king to start planning for years of\r\n        famine ahead. He informed him that the famine would affect not only Egypt but the neighboring\r\n        countries as well. Yusuf’s administrative skills and foresight during the famine not only saved Egypt but also demonstrated his exceptional leadership and integrity. The king offered him a high position. Joseph asked to be made controller of the\r\n        granaries, so that he could guard the nation's harvest and thereby safeguard it during the\r\n        anticipated drought. By this Joseph did not mean to seize an opportunity or personal gain; he\r\n        merely wanted to rescue hungry nations for a personal gain; he merely wanted to rescue hungry\r\n        nations for a period of seven years. It was a sheer nobleness on his part in that he wanted to\r\n        ensure that many people would not die as a result. Almighty Allah said:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And the king said: \"Bring him to me that I may attach him to my person.\" Then, when he spoke\r\n        to him, he said: \"Verily, this day, you are with us high in rank and full trusted.\"\r\n        Joseph said: \"Set me over the store houses of the land; I will indeed guard them with full\r\n        knowledge.\" (as a minister of finance in Egypt, in place of Al-Aziz who was dead at that time).\r\n        Thus did We give full authority to Joseph in the land, to take possession therein, as when or\r\n        where he likes. We bestow of Our Mercy on whom We please, and We make not to be lost the\r\n        reward of Al Muhsineen (the good-doers). (Surah 12:54-57).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Reunion with His Family</h2>\r\n    <p>The wheels of time turned. During the seven good years, Joseph had full control over the\r\n        cultivation, harvesting, and storage of crops. During the following seven years, drought followed\r\n        and famine spread throughout the region, including Canaan, the homeland of Joseph. Joseph\r\n        advised the king that as his kingdom was blessed with reserved grain, he should sell his grain to\r\n        the needy nations at a fair price. The king agreed, and the good news spread all over the region.</p>\r\n    <p>Jacob sent ten of his sons, all except Benjamin, to Egypt to purchase provisions. Joseph heard of\r\n        the ten brothers who had come from afar and who could not speak the language of the Egyptians.\r\n        When they called on him to purchase their needs, Joseph immediately recognized his brothers, but\r\n        they did not know him. How could they? To them Joseph no longer existed; he had been thrown\r\n        into the deep, dark well many years ago!</p>\r\n    <p>Yusuf’s brothers came to Egypt seeking food. They did not recognize Yusuf, who had changed significantly and held a position of authority. Yusuf recognized them and used the opportunity to test their character and remorse.</p>\r\n    <p>Joseph received them warmly. After supplying them with provisions, he asked where they had\r\n        come from. They explained: \"We are eleven brothers, the children of a noble prophet. The\r\n        youngest is at home tending to the needs of our aging father.\"</p>\r\n    <p>On hearing this, Joseph's eyes filled with tears; his longing for home swelled up in his heart, as\r\n        well as his longing for his beloved parents and his loving brother Benjamin. \"Are you truthful\r\n        people?\" Joseph asked them. Allah the Almighty said:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And Joseph's brethren came and they entered unto him, and he recognized them, but they\r\n        recognized him not. And when he had furnished them forth with provisions (according to their\r\n        need), he said: \"Bring me a brother of yours from your father; (he meant Benjamin). See you not\r\n        that I give full measure, and that I am the best of the hosts? But if you bring him onto me, there\r\n        shall be no measure of corn for you with me, nor shall you come near me.\"\r\n        They said: \"We shall try to get permission for him from his father, and verily, we shall do it.\"\r\n        And (Joseph) told his servants to put their money (with which they had bought the corn) into\r\n        their bags, so that they might know it when they go back to their people, in order that they might\r\n        come back. (Surah 12:58-62)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"So when they returned to their father, they said: \"O our father! No more measure of grain shall\r\n        we get (unless we take our brother). So send our brother with us, and we shall get our measure\r\n        and truly we will guard him.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        He said: \"Can I entrust him to you except as I entrust his brother (Joseph) to you aforetime? But\r\n        Allah is the best to guard, and He is the Most Merciful of those Who show mercy.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        And when thopened their bags, they found their money had been returned to them. They said: \"O\r\n        our father! What more can we desire? This, our money has been returned to us, so we shall get\r\n        more food for our family, and we shall guard our brother and add one more measure of a\r\n        camel's load. This quantity is easy (for the king to give).\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        He (Jacob) said: \"I will not send him with you until you swear a solemn oath to me in Allah's\r\n        Name, that you will bring him back to me unless you are yourselves surrounded (by enemies,\r\n        etc). And when they had sworn their solemn oath, he said: \"Allah is the Witness over what we\r\n        have said.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        And he said: \"O my sons! Do not enter by one gate, but by different gates, and I cannot avail\r\n        you against Allah at all. Verily! The decision rests only with Allah. In Him, I put my trust and let\r\n        all those that trust, put their trust in Him.\" (Surah 12:63-67).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The next day, while their bags were being filled with grains to load onto the camels, Joseph\r\n        ordered one of his attendants to place the king's gold cup which was used for measuring the grain\r\n        into Benjamin's saddlebag. When the brothers were ready to set out, the gates were locked, and\r\n        the court crier shouted: \"O you travelers, you are thieves!\" The accusation was most unusual, and\r\n        the people gathered around Joseph's brothers.</p>\r\n    <p>He accused them of being spies and held one of them as a hostage until they brought their youngest brother, Benjamin, to Egypt. This plan was intended to gauge their sincerity and repentance. Eventually, Yusuf revealed his true identity to his brothers, who were initially shocked but deeply remorseful for their past actions.</p>\r\n    <p>\"What have you lost?\" his brothers inquired.</p>\r\n    <p>A soldier said: \"The king's golden cup. Whoever can trace it we will give a beast load of grain.\"</p>\r\n    <p>Joseph's brothers said with all innocence: \"We have not come here to corrupt the land and steal.\"</p>\r\n    <p>Joseph's officers said (as he had instructed them): What punishment should you choose for the\r\n        thief?\"</p>\r\n    <p>The brothers answered: \"According to our law, whoever steals becomes a slave to the owner of\r\n        the property.\" The officers agreed: \"We shall apply your law instead of the Egyptian law, which provides for\r\n        imprisonment.\"</p>\r\n    <p>The chief officer ordered his soldiers to start searching the caravan. Joseph was watching the\r\n        incident from high upon his throne. He had given instructions for Benjamin's bag to be the last to\r\n        be searched. When they did not find the cup in the bags of the ten older brothers, the brothers\r\n        sighed in relief.</p>\r\n    <h4>Benjamin is Accused</h4>\r\n    <p>There remained only the bag of their youngest brother. Joseph said, intervening for the first time,\r\n        that there was no need to search his saddle as he did not look like a thief.\r\n        His brothers affirmed: \"We will not move an inch unless his saddle is searched as well. We are the\r\n        sons of a noble man, not thieves.\"\r\n        The soldiers reached in their hands and pulled out the king's cup. The brothers exclaimed: \"If he\r\n        steals now, a brother of his has stolen before.\" They strayed from the present issue in order to\r\n        blame a particular group of the children of Jacob.\r\n        Joseph heard their resentment with his own ears and was filled with regret. Yet, he swallowed his\r\n        own resentment, keeping it within. He said to himself, \"you went further and fared worse; it shall\r\n        go bad with you and worse hereafter, and Allah knows your intention.\"\r\n        Silence fell upon them after these remarks by the brothers. Then they forgot their secret\r\n        satisfaction and thought of Jacob; they had taken an oath with him that they would not betray his\r\n        son. They began to beg Joseph for mercy. \"Joseph, O minister! Take one of us instead. He is the\r\n        son of a good man, and we can see you are a good man.\"\r\n        Joseph answered calmly: \"How can you want to set free the man who has stolen the king's cup? It\r\n        would be sinful.\"\r\n        The brothers went on pleading for mercy. However, the guards said that the king had spoke and\r\n        his word was law. Judah, the eldest, was much worried and told the others: \"We promised our\r\n        father in the name of Allah not to fail him. I will, therefore, stay behind and will only return if my\r\n        father permits me to do so.\" Regarding this scene, Almighty Allah said:</p>\r\n        <blockquote>\"And when they entered according to their father's advice, it did not avail them in the least\r\n            against (the Will of ) Allah, it was but a need of Jacob's inner self which he discharged. And\r\n            verily, he was endowed with knowledge because We had taught him, but most men know not. And\r\n            when they went in before Joseph, he betook his brother (Benjamin) to himself and said: \"Verily! I\r\n            am your brother, so grieve not for what they used to do.\"\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            So when he had furnished them forth with their provisions, he put the golden bowl in his\r\n            brother's bag. Then a crier cried: \"O you in the caravan! Surely, you are thieves!\"\r\n            They, turning towards them said: \"What is that you have missed?\"\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            They said: \"We have missed the golden bowl of the king and for him who produces it is the\r\n            reward of a camel load; I will be bound by it.\"\r\n            They said: \"By Allah! Indeed you know that we came not to make mischief in the land, and we\r\n            are no thieves!\"\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            They (Joseph's brothers) said: \"The penalty should be that he, in whose bag it is found, should\r\n            be held for the punishment of the crime. Thus we punish the Zalimeen (wrongdoers, etc)!\"\r\n            So he (Joseph) began the search in their bags before the bag of his brother. Then he brought it\r\n            out of his brother's bag. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not take his brother by the law\r\n            of the king (as a slave), except that Allah willed it. So Allah made the brothers to bind\r\n            themselves with their way of 'punishment, i.e. enslaving of a thief.' We raise to degrees whom We\r\n            please, but over all those endowed with knowledge is the All-Knowing (Allah).\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            They (Joseph's brothers) said: \"If he steals, there was a brother of his (Joseph) who did steal\r\n            before him.\" But these things did Joseph keep in himself, revealing not the secrets to them. He\r\n            said (within himself): \"You are in the worst case, and Allah knows best the truth of what you\r\n            assert!\"\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            They said : \"O ruler of the land! Verily, he has an old father who will grieve for him, so take one\r\n            of us in his place. Indeed we think that you are one of the good doers.\"\r\n            He said: \"Allah forbid! That we should take anyone but him with whom we found our property.\r\n            Indeed if we did so, we shall be Zalimun (wrongdoers).\"\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            So, when they despaired of him, they held a conference in private. The eldest among them said:\r\n            \"Know you not that your father did take an oath from you in Allah's name, and before this did\r\n            fail in your duty with Joseph? Therefore, I will not leave this land until my father permits me, or\r\n            Allah decides my case (by releasing Benjamin) and He is the Best of the judges.\" (Surah 12:68-80).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Joseph's Plan</h4>\r\n    <p>The brothers left enough provisions behind for Judah, who stayed at a tavern awaiting the fate of\r\n        Benjamin. In the meantime, Joseph kept Benjamin in his house as his personal guest and told him\r\n        how he had devised the plot to put the king's cup in his bag, in order to keep him behind, so as to\r\n        protect him. He was also glad that Judah had stayed behind, as he was a good hearted brother.\r\n        Joseph secretly arranged to watch over Judah's well being.\r\n        Joseph's plan in sending the others back was to test their sincerity, to see if they would come back\r\n        for the two brothers they had left behind.</p>\r\n    <p>When they arrived home, they entered upon their father calling: \"O our father! Your son has\r\n        stolen!\"\r\n        He was puzzled, scarcely believing the news. He was overwhelmed with sorrow and his eyes wept\r\n        tears. \"Patience be with me; perhaps Allah will return all of them to me. He is Most Knowing,\r\n        Most Wise.\" A pal of lonesomeness closed over him, yet he found consolation in patience and\r\n        trusted in Allah.</p>    \r\n    <p>Allah revealed to us what happened at their meeting with their father:</p>   \r\n    <blockquote>\"Return to your father and say: 'O our father! Verily, your son (Benjamin) has stolen, and we\r\n        testify not except according to what we know, and we could not known the unseen! And ask the\r\n        people of the town where we have been, and the caravan in which we returned and indeed we are\r\n        telling the truth.\"\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        He (Jacob) said: \"Nay, but your ownselves have beguiled you into something. So patience is\r\n        most fitting for me. Maybe Allah will bring them back all to me. Truly He! Only He is\r\n        All-Knowing, All-Wise.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        And he turned away from them and said: \"Alas, my grief for Joseph!\" And he lost his sight\r\n        because of the sorrow that he was suppressing. (Surah 12:81-84)</blockquote> \r\n    <p>The father was deeply hurt. Only prayer could comfort him and strengthen his faith and patience.\r\n        Weeping all those years for his beloved son Joseph - and now one more of his best sons had been\r\n        snatched from him - Jacob almost lost his sight.\r\n        The other sons pleaded with him: \"O father, you are a noble prophet and a great messenger of\r\n        Allah. Unto you descended revelation and people received guidance and faith from you. Why are\r\n        you destroying yourself in this way?\"\r\n        Jacob replied: \"Rebuking me will not lessen my grief. Only the return of my sons will comfort me.\r\n        My sons, go in search of Joseph and his brother; do not despair of Allah's mercy.\" Allah, the Almighty told us:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"They said: \"By Allah! You will never cease remembering Joseph until you become weak with old\r\n        age, or until you be of the dead.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        He said: \"I only complain of my grief and sorrow to Allah, and I know from Allah that which you\r\n        know not. O my sons! Go you and inquire about Joseph and his brother and never give up hope\r\n        of Allah's Mercy. Certainly no one despairs of Allah's Mercy, except the people who disbelieve.\"\r\n        (Surah 12:85-87).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The caravan set out for Egypt. The brothers - on their way to see the chief minister (Joseph) -\r\n        were poor and depressed.\r\n        On reaching Egypt they collected Judah and called on Joseph, to whom they pleaded:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"O ruler of the land! A hard time has hit us and our family, and we have brought but poor\r\n        capital, so pay us full measure and be charitable to us. Truly, Allah does reward the charitable.\"\r\n        (Surah 12:88).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>At the end, they begged Joseph. They asked alms of him, appealing to his heart, reminding him\r\n        that Allah rewards alms givers. At this moment, in the midst of their plight, Joseph spoke to them\r\n        in their native tongue saying:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Do you know what you did with Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?\"\r\n        They said: \"Are you indeed Joseph?\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        He said: \"I am Joseph, and his is my brother (Benjamin). Allah has indeed been Gracious to us.\r\n        Verily, he who fears Allah with obedience to Him (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds, and by\r\n        performing righteous good deeds), and is patient, then surely, Allah makes not the reward of the\r\n        good doers to be lost.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        They said: \"By Allah! Indeed Allah has preferred you above us, and we certainly have been\r\n        sinners.\" (Surah 12:89-91)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The brothers began to tremble with fear, but Joseph comforted them:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"No reproach on you this day, may Allah forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who\r\n        show mercy!\" (Surah 12:92)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Jacob Learns About Joseph</h2>\r\n    <p>Joseph embraced them, and together they wept with joy. It was not possible for Joseph to leave\r\n        his responsible office without proper replacement, so he advised his brothers:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Go with this shirt of mine, and cast it over the face of my father, he will become clear-sighted,\r\n        and bring to me all your family.\" (Surah 12:93)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>And so the caravan headed back for Palestine. We lave the scene in Egypt and return to Palestine\r\n        and the house of Jacob. The old man is sitting in his room; tears have been flowing down his\r\n        cheeks. He stands up all of a sudden, dresses and goes out to his son's wives. Then he lifts up his\r\n        face to Heaven and sniffs the air.</p>\r\n    <p>The wife of the eldest son remarked: \"Jacob has come out of his room today.\" The women\r\n        inquired about what was amiss. There was a hint of a smile on his face. The others asked him:</p>\r\n    <p>\"How do you feel today?\"\r\n        He answered: \"I can smell Joseph in the air.\"\r\n        The wives left him alone, saying to one another that there was no hope for the old man. 'he will\r\n        die of weeping over Joseph.'\r\n        \"Did he talk about Joseph's shirt?\"\r\n        \"I do not know. He said he could smell him; perhaps he has gone mad.\"\r\n        That day the old man wanted a cup of milk to break his fast, for he had been fasting. At night he\r\n        changed his clothes. The caravan was traveling in the desert with Joseph's shirt hidden among the\r\n        grain. It neared the old man's estate. He gesticulated in his room, and then he prayed a long time,\r\n        lifting his hands to heaven and sniffing the air. He was weeping as the shirt was nearing him.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>And when the caravan departed, their father said: \"I do indeed feel the smell of Joseph, if only\r\n        you think me not a dotard (a person who has weakness of mind because of old age).\"\r\n        They said: \"By Allah! Certainly, you are in your old error.\"\r\n        Then, when the bearer of the glad tidings arrived, he cast the shirt over his face, and he became\r\n        clear sighted. He said: \"Did I not say to you, I know from Allah that which you know not.\"\"\r\n        They said: \"O our father! Ask Forgiveness from Allah for our sins, indeed we have been\r\n        sinners.\" (Surah 12:94-97)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <p>The emotional reunion with his father Yaqub, who had long grieved Yusuf’s loss, was a moment of immense joy and relief. The entire family was reunited, and Yusuf’s dreams were fulfilled as they all came to him in Egypt, seeking his help during the famine.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>He said: \"I will ask my Lord for forgiveness for you, verily, He! Only He is the Oft-Forgiving,\r\n        the Most Merciful.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Then, when they entered unto Joseph, he betook his parents to himself and said: \"Enter Egypt, if\r\n        Allah will, in security.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        And he raised his parents to the throne and they fell down before him prostrate. And he said: \"O\r\n        my father! This is the interpretation of my dream of old! My Lord has made it come true! He was\r\n        indeed good to me, when He took me out of prison, and brought you all here out of the Bedouin\r\n        life, after Satan had sown enmity between me and my brothers. Certainly, my Lord is the Most\r\n        Courteous and Kind unto whom He will. Truly He!

His story, narrated in the Quran, serves as a profound example of enduring faith and resilience amidst suffering.</p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Ishaaq stated that he was a man of Rum. His name was Job, Ibn Mose, Ibn Razeh, Ibn Esau,\r\n        Ibn Isaac (pbuh), Ibn Abraham (pbuh). Someone else said he was Job, Ibn Mose, Ibn Rimil, Ibn\r\n        Esau, Ibn Isaac, Ibn Jacob. There have also been other statements on his lineage. Ibn Asaker\r\n        narrated that his mother was a daughter of Lot (pbuh). It was said, also that his father was one\r\n        who believed in Abraham (pbuh) when he was cast into the fire.\r\n        The first opinion is the most plausible, because he was a descendant of Abraham's offspring as\r\n        Allah Almighty declared:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"That was Our proof which We gave Abraham against his people. We raise whom We will in\r\n        degrees. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All Knowing. And We bestowed upon him Isaac and\r\n        Jacob, each of them We guided and before him, We guided Noah, and among his progeny David,\r\n        Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron. Thus do We reward the good doers. (Surah 6:83-84)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Allah the Almighty praised His worshipper Job in His Glorious Quran:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Truly! We found him patient. How excellent a slave! Verily, he was ever oft returning in\r\n        repentance to Us!\" (Surah 38:44)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Early Life and Blessings</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Ayyub was a highly respected and wealthy individual in his community. He was blessed with a large family, abundant wealth, and good health. Known for his piety, Ayyub used his blessings to help those in need, engaging in acts of charity and justice. He was renowned for his humility and sincere worship of Allah, despite his considerable material success.</p>\r\n    <p>His prosperity did not lead to arrogance or pride. Instead, Ayyub remained grateful to Allah for His blessings, always acknowledging that his wealth and health were gifts from the Almighty. His life was a testament to the proper use of divine blessings and the importance of remaining humble and thankful.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Divine Test</h2>\r\n    <p>To test Ayyub’s faith and perseverance, Allah allowed him to face a series of profound trials. Ayyub’s health deteriorated drastically; he was afflicted with a severe disease that covered his body with painful sores. His suffering was compounded by the loss of his wealth and property. Despite these calamities, Ayyub’s faith in Allah remained unwavering.</p>\r\n    <p>Ibn Asaker narrated: \"Job was a man having much wealth of all kinds; beats, slaves, sheep, vast\r\n        lands of Haran and many children. All those favors were taken from him and he was physically\r\n        afflicted as well. Never a single organ was sound except his heart and tongue, with both of which\r\n        he glorified Allah, the Almighty all the time day and night. His disease lasted for a long time until\r\n        his visitors felt disgusted with him. His friends kept away from him and people abstained from\r\n        visiting him. No one felt sympathy for him except his wife. She took good care of him, knowing\r\n        his former charity and pity for her.\"</p>\r\n    <p>In addition to his physical ailments, Ayyub experienced the tragic loss of his children. This series of trials was intended to test his character and faith. His response to these hardships was characterized by patience and continued devotion to Allah, illustrating the essence of true faith under adversity.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And [mention] Ayyub, when he called to his Lord, 'Indeed, adversity has touched me, and you are the most merciful of the merciful.'\" <br>(Surah Al-Anbiya, 21:83)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Response to Trials</h2>\r\n    <p>Despite his suffering, Ayyub did not lose hope or despair. His patience and trust in Allah were exemplary. Even though his condition was dire, he remained steadfast, continuing to praise Allah and seek His mercy. This unwavering faith was a central aspect of Ayyub’s character and is a key lesson from his story.</p>\r\n    <p>Ayyub’s wife, who had been a source of support throughout his trials, also faced difficulties as a result of their suffering. She tried to provide comfort and support, but the trials took a toll on her as well. Her unwavering support for Ayyub during these times reflected the strength of their mutual faith and love.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Divine Relief and Restoration</h2>\r\n    <p>After enduring his trials with remarkable patience, Allah decided to relieve Ayyub from his suffering. Allah commanded Ayyub to strike the ground with his foot, from which a spring of water gushed forth. Allah instructed Ayyub to bathe in this water, which led to the complete healing of his ailments and restoration of his health.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Verily! distress has seized me and You are the Most Merciful of all those who show mercy.\" so\r\n        We answered his call, and we removed the distress that was on him, and We restored his family\r\n        to him (that he had lost), and the like thereof along with them as a mercy from Ourselves and a\r\n        Reminder for all who worship Us.\" (Surah 21:83-84)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Remember Our slave Job, when he invoked His Lord saying: \"Verily! Satan has touched me\r\n        with distress (by losing my health) and torment (by losing my wealth)!\" Allah said to him: \"Strike\r\n        the ground with your foot: This is a spring of water to wash in and cool and a refreshing drink.\"\r\n        And We gave him back his family, and along with them the like thereof as a Mercy from Us, and\r\n        a reminder for those who understand.\" (Surah 38:41-43)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Along with the physical healing, Allah restored Ayyub’s wealth and blessed him with new children. His previous wealth was returned, and he was granted twice the number of children he had before. This restoration was a manifestation of Allah’s mercy and a reward for Ayyub’s unwavering faith and perseverance.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And We gave him back his family twice as many, as a mercy from Us and a lesson for people of reason.\" <br>(Surah Sad, 38:43)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>This divine relief served as a testament to Allah’s justice and mercy, showcasing that sincere patience and faith are always rewarded in the end.</p>\r\n    <p>Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said:\r\n        \"While Job was naked, taking a bath, a swarm of gold locusts fell on him, and he started\r\n        collecting them in his garment. His Lord called him: \"O Job! Have I not made you too rich to\r\n        need what you see?\" He said: \"Yes, My Lord! But I cannot shun Your Blessings.\" (Al Bukhari)</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Lessons from Ayyub’s Story</h2>\r\n    <p>The story of Prophet Ayyub imparts several valuable lessons:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Patience and Resilience:</strong> Ayyub’s story highlights the virtue of patience, demonstrating how enduring severe trials with grace can lead to divine relief and reward. His ability to remain patient despite his suffering is a profound lesson in resilience.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Trust in Divine Wisdom:</strong> Ayyub’s unwavering faith illustrates the importance of trusting in Allah’s wisdom. His story teaches that trials and hardships are part of a divine plan, and that patience and trust in Allah’s ultimate justice will lead to resolution and reward.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Gratitude and Humility:</strong> Despite his suffering, Ayyub remained humble and grateful, acknowledging Allah’s sovereignty and mercy. His attitude reflects the importance of maintaining gratitude and humility in both prosperity and adversity.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Mercy and Compassion:</strong> Allah’s response to Ayyub’s patience, including his healing and restoration, underscores the significance of divine mercy and compassion. The story demonstrates that Allah rewards those who persevere with faith and righteousness.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Resisting Despair:</strong> Ayyub’s resilience in the face of prolonged suffering highlights the importance of resisting despair. His story encourages maintaining hope and faith in Allah’s promises, even in the most challenging circumstances.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>The Role of Supportive Relationships:</strong> Ayyub’s wife’s unwavering support and compassion during his trials emphasize the value of having supportive relationships and remaining steadfast together through hardships.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>Prophet Ayyub’s narrative is a timeless lesson in patience, trust, and gratitude.

He is celebrated for his role in guiding the people of Madyan towards justice, honesty, and monotheism. His story, as narrated in the Quran, offers profound lessons on ethical behavior, perseverance, and divine justice.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Early Life and Prophethood</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Shu'aib was born into a family of strong moral character and was a descendant of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him). He was sent to the people of Madyan, a region located in what is now northwestern Saudi Arabia, known for its bustling trade and economic activities. Madyan was a prosperous city with a wealthy merchant class.</p>\r\n    <p>Shu'aib was chosen by Allah to address the widespread corruption in Madyan. The people were notorious for their unethical business practices, including cheating in weights and measures, as well as widespread idolatry. His mission was to restore fairness and integrity in trade and to call his people back to the worship of Allah alone.</p>\r\n    <p>He was known for his eloquence and wisdom, and his leadership was characterized by a deep commitment to justice and righteousness. Shu'aib’s role as a prophet involved not only preaching but also actively engaging in reforming societal norms and practices.</p>\r\n    <p>Allah the Almighty revealed the story of Shu'aib (pbuh):</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"To the people of Madyan (Madian) (We sent) their brother Shu'aib. He said: \"O my people!\r\n        Worship Allah, you have no other Ilah (God) but Him. Verily! a clear proof (sign) from your\r\n        Lord has come unto you; so give full measure and full weight and wrong not men in their things,\r\n        and do not mischief on the earth after it has been set in order that will be better for you, if you\r\n        are believers. And sit not on every road, threatening, and hindering from the Path of Allah those\r\n        who believe in Him, and seeking to make it crooked. Remember when you were but few, and He\r\n        multiplied you. See what was the end of the Mufsideen (mischief makers, corrupts and liars). And\r\n        if there is a party of you who believes in that which I have been sent and a party who do not\r\n        believe, so be patient until Allah judges between us, and He is the Best of judges.\"\r\n        The chiefs of those who were arrogant among his people said: \"We shall certainly drive you out,\r\n        O Shu'aib! and those who have believed with you from our town, or else you all shall return to\r\n        our religion.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        He said: \"Even though we hate it! We should have invented a lie against Allah if we returned to\r\n        your religion, after Allah has rescued us from it. It is not for us to return to it unless Allah, our\r\n        Lord, should will. Our Lord comprehends all things in His Knowledge. In Allah (Alone) we put\r\n        our trust. Our Lord! Judge between us and our people in truth, for You are the Best of those Who\r\n        gives judgment.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        The chiefs of those who disbelieved among his people said to their people: \"If you follow Shu'aib\r\n        be sure then you will be the losers!\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Then he (shu'aib) turned from them and said: \"O my people! I have indeed conveyed my Lord's\r\n        Messages unto you and I have given you good advice. Then how can I sorrow for the\r\n        disbelieving people's (destruction).\" (Surah 7:85-93)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Core Message of Shu'aib</h2>\r\n    <p>The people of Madyan were Arabs who lived in the country of Ma'an, part of which today is\r\n        greater Syria. They were a greedy people who did not believe that Allah existed and who led\r\n        wicked lives. They gave short measure, praised their goods beyond their worth, and hid their\r\n        defects. They lied to their customers, thereby cheating them.</p>\r\n    <p>Allah sent His Prophet Shu'aib (pbuh) armed with many miracles. Shu'aib preached to them,\r\n        begging them to be mindful of Allah's favors and warning them of the consequences of their evil\r\n        ways, but they only mocked him. Shu'aib remained calm as he reminded them of his kinship to\r\n        them and that what he was doing was not for his personal gain.</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Honesty in Trade:</strong> Shu'aib condemned the practice of cheating in trade, such as using false weights and measures. He emphasized the importance of honesty and fairness in all commercial transactions, arguing that such practices harm both individuals and society.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Worship of One God:</strong> He called his people to abandon the worship of idols and to worship Allah alone. His message stressed that worshipping Allah and recognizing Him as the sole deity was fundamental to ethical behavior and social justice.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Social Justice:</strong> Shu'aib’s teachings extended to advocating for social justice and the protection of the rights of the poor and vulnerable. He warned against exploitation and corruption, urging his people to act with integrity and compassion.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <blockquote>\"O my people, give full measure and weight in justice and do not deprive the people of their due and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.\" <br>(Surah Hud, 11:85)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Resistance and Persecution</h2>\r\n    <p>The response to Shu'aib’s message was overwhelmingly negative. The wealthy and powerful merchants of Madyan were particularly resistant to his call for reform because his message threatened their lucrative but unethical business practices. They accused Shu'aib of being a madman and rejected his teachings outright.</p>\r\n    <p>Allah the Exalted stated:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"The dwellers of Al Aiyka (near Midian, or Madyan) belied the Messengers. When Shu'aib said\r\n        to them: \"Will you not fear Allah and obey Him? I am a trustworthy Messenger to you. SO fear\r\n        Allah, keep your duty to Him, and obey me. No reward do I ask of you for it (my message of\r\n        Islamic Monotheism), my reward is only from the Lord of the Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that\r\n        exists). Give full measure, and cause no loss to others. And weigh with the true and straight\r\n        balance. Defraud not people by reducing their things nor do evil making corruption and mischief\r\n        in the land. Fear Him Who created you and the generations of the men of old.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        They said: \"You are only one of those bewitched! You are but a human being like us and verily,\r\n        we think that you are one of the liars! So cause a piece of heaven to fall on us, if you are of the\r\n        truthful!\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        He said: \"My Lord is the Best Knower of what you do.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        But, they belied him, so the torment of the day of shadow (a gloomy cloud) seized them, indeed\r\n        that was the torment of a Great Day. Verily, in this is a sign yet most of them are not believers.\r\n        And verily! Your Lord, He is indeed the All Mighty, the Most Merciful.\" (Surah 26:176-191).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Shu'aib faced severe opposition, including threats of violence and expulsion from the city. Despite this, he remained resolute, continuing to preach and call for repentance. His patience in the face of adversity was a testament to his commitment to his mission.</p>\r\n    <p>In response to the mounting hostility, Shu'aib remained optimistic, placing his trust in Allah’s wisdom and justice. His perseverance under such intense pressure is an important aspect of his story, demonstrating his dedication to his prophetic mission and his trust in divine support.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And [Shu'aib] said, 'O my people, I do not ask you for any reward for it. My reward is only from the one who created me. Indeed, my Lord is upon a straight path.'\" <br>(Surah Hud, 11:72)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Divine Punishment</h2>\r\n    <p>Despite Shu'aib’s sincere efforts and warnings, the people of Madyan refused to heed his message. Their persistent disbelief and corruption led to Allah’s decree of punishment. The punishment came in the form of a sudden and devastating natural disaster.</p>\r\n    <p>The city of Madyan was struck by a catastrophic event—some interpretations suggest it was a combination of an earthquake and a scorching heatwave. The disaster led to the complete destruction of the city and its inhabitants, serving as a divine warning to others.</p>\r\n    <p>They seized the belongings of Shu'aib and his followers, then drove them out of the city. The\r\n        Messenger turned to his Lord for help, and his plea was answered. Allah sent down on them\r\n        scorching heat and they suffered terribly. On seeing a cloud gathering in the sky, they thought it\r\n        would bring cool, refreshing rain, and rushed outside in the hope of enjoying the rainfall. Instead\r\n        the cloud burst, hurling thunderbolts and fire. They heard a thunderous sound from above which\r\n        caused the earth under their feet to tremble. The evil doers perished in this state of horror.</p>\r\n    <p>Shu'aib’s message to his people was multifaceted:</p>\r\n    <p>Shu'aib and those who believed in his message were spared from the disaster, demonstrating Allah’s protection for the righteous and those who uphold justice. The destruction of Madyan was a powerful lesson to surrounding communities and future generations about the consequences of rejecting divine guidance and engaging in corruption.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And when the punishment descended upon them, they were in the morning within their homes fallen prostrate.\" <br>(Surah Al-Hijr, 15:77)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Legacy and Lessons of Shu'aib</h2>\r\n    <p>The story of Prophet Shu'aib imparts several significant lessons:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Ethical Conduct:</strong> Shu'aib’s emphasis on honesty and fairness in business highlights the importance of ethical conduct in all aspects of life. His teachings remind us that integrity and justice are fundamental values that must be upheld in personal and professional interactions.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Perseverance in Prophethood:</strong> Shu'aib’s unwavering dedication to his mission, despite intense opposition, demonstrates the importance of perseverance and resilience. His example encourages individuals to remain steadfast in their principles and beliefs, even when faced with significant challenges.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Trust in Divine Justice:</strong> The story underscores the importance of trusting in Allah’s wisdom and justice. Shu'aib’s deliverance and the subsequent punishment of Madyan highlight the certainty of divine justice and the consequences of rejecting divine guidance.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Advocacy for Social Justice:</strong> Shu'aib’s call for social justice and protection of the vulnerable reflects the need for social responsibility and compassion. His teachings advocate for the fair treatment of all individuals and the rejection of exploitation and corruption.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Divine Mercy and Protection:</strong> The salvation of Shu'aib and his followers from the punishment of Madyan illustrates Allah’s mercy and protection for those who adhere to His guidance and remain steadfast in righteousness.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>Prophet Shu'aib’s story serves as a timeless reminder of the values of honesty, justice, and perseverance.

His story is detailed in the Quran and is a profound account of faith, perseverance, and divine intervention. His life is marked by miraculous events, his confrontation with the Pharaoh, and his leadership of the Children of Israel.</p>\r\n    <p>The pharaoh who ruled Egypt was a tyrant who oppressed the descendants of Jacob (pbuh),\r\n        known as the children of Israel (Bani Israel). He used every means to demean and disgrace them.\r\n        They were kept in bondage and forced to work for him for small wages or nothing. Under this\r\n        system the people obeyed and worshipped the pharaoh, and the ruling class carried out his orders,\r\n        thereby authorizing his tyranny and crazy whims.\r\n        The pharaoh wanted the people to obey him only, and to believe in the gods of his invention.\r\n        Perhaps, during that time, there were many classes of people who did not believe in or practice\r\n        polytheism; however, they kept this to themselves and outwardly did as they were expected to do,\r\n        without revolting or revealing themselves to anyone.\r\n        Thus, successive dynasties came to Egypt and assumed that they were gods or their representative\r\n        or spokesmen.</p>\r\n    <p>Years passed, and a despotic king, who was adored by the Egyptians, ruled Egypt. His king saw\r\n        the children of Israel multiplying and prospering. He heard them talking about a vague vision that\r\n        one of Israel' s sons would dethrone the pharaoh of Egypt. Perhaps this vision was only a\r\n        daydream that persisted within the hearts of the persecuted minority, or perhaps it was a prophecy\r\n        from their books.\r\n        Another tradition states that it was Pharaoh himself who had the vision. Ibn 'Abbas narrated:\r\n        \"Pharaoh saw in his vision a fire, which came from Jerusalem and burned the houses of the\r\n        Egyptians, and all Copts, and did not do harm to the children of Israel. When he woke up, he was\r\n        horrified. He then gathered his priests and magicians and asked them about this vision. They said:\r\n        \"This means a boy will be born of them and the Egyptian people will perish at his hands.' That is\r\n        why Pharaoh commanded that all male children of the children of Israel be killed.\"\r\n        Either way, this vision reached the ears of the Pharaoh. He then issued a decree to slay any male\r\n        child that would be born to the children of Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Early Life and Adoption</h2>\r\n    <p>The killing of the children of Israel was carried out until the experts of economics said to Pharaoh:\r\n        \"The aged of the children of Israel die and the young are slaughtered. This will lead to their\r\n        annihilation. As a result, Pharaoh will lose the manpower of those who work for him, those whom\r\n        he enslaves, and their women whom he exploits. It is better to regulate this procedure by initiating\r\n        the following policy: males should be slaughtered in one year but spared to live the next year.\"\r\n        Pharaoh found that solution to be safer economically.</p>\r\n    <p>Moses's mother was pregnant with Aaron (pbuh) in a year that boys were spared; thus she gave\r\n        birth to the child publicly and safely. During a year in which boys were to be slain, she gave birth\r\n        to Moses (pbuh); thus his birth caused her much terror. She was afraid he would be slain, so she\r\n        nursed him secretly. Allah the Almighty revealed:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"These are Verses of the manifest Book (that makes clear truth from falsehood, good from evil,\r\n        etc.). We recite to you some of the news of Moses and Pharaoh in truth, for a people who believe\r\n        (those who believe in this Quran, and in the Oneness of Allah). Verily, Pharaoh exalted himself\r\n        in the land and made its people sects, weakening (oppressing) a group (children of Israel)\r\n        among them, killing their sons, and letting their females live. Verily, he was of the Mufsideen\r\n        (those who commit great sins and crimes, oppressors, tyrants, etc.).\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        And we wished to do a favor to those who were weak (and oppressed) in the land, and to make\r\n        them rulers and to make them the inheritors, and to establish them in the land, and We let\r\n        Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts receive from them that which they feared. And We inspired\r\n        the mother of Moses, saying: \"Suckle him (Moses), but when you fear for him, then cast him into\r\n        the river and fear not, nor grieve. Verily! We shall bring him back to you, and shall make him\r\n        one of (Our) Messengers.\" (Surah 28: 2-7).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Prophet Musa was born to an Israelite family in Egypt at a time when the Pharaoh had decreed the killing of all newborn Israelite males to prevent their population from growing. To protect her son, Musa's mother placed him in a basket and set it afloat on the Nile River, trusting in Allah's protection.</p>\r\n    <p>She was\r\n        commanded to make a basket for Moses. She nursed him, put him into the basket, then went to\r\n        the shore of the Nile and threw it into the water. Her mother's heart, the most merciful one in the\r\n        world, grieved as she threw her son into the Nile. However, she was aware that Allah was much\r\n        more merciful to Moses than to her, that He loved him more than her. Allah was his Lord and the\r\n        Lord of the Nile.</p>\r\n    <p>Hardly had the basket touched the water of the Nile than Allah issued His command to the waves\r\n        to be calm and gentle while carrying the child would one day be a prophet. She instructed her\r\n        daughter to follow the course of the basket and to report back to her. As the daughter followed\r\n        the floating basket along the riverbank, she found herself right in the palace grounds and saw what\r\n        was unfolding before her eyes.</p>\r\n    <p>The basket came to rest at the riverbank, which skirted the king's palace. The palace servants\r\n        found the basket with the baby and took it to the Pharaoh and his queen. When the queen, Asiya beheld\r\n        the lovely infant, Allah instilled in her a strong love for this baby. Pharaoh's wife was very\r\n        different from Pharaoh. He was a disbeliever; she was a believer. He was cruel; she was merciful.\r\n        He was a tyrant; she was delicate and goodhearted. She was sad because she was infertile and had\r\n        hoped to have a son. Hardly had she held the baby than she kissed him.\r\n        Pharaoh was much amazed when he saw his wife hugging this baby to her breast. He was much\r\n        astonished because his wife was weeping with joy, something he had never seen her do before.\r\n        She requested her husband: \"Let me keep the baby and let him be a son to us.\"</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Then the household of Pharaoh picked him up, that he might become for them an enemy and a\r\n        cause of grief. Verily! Pharaoh, Haman, and their hosts were sinners. And the wife of Pharaoh\r\n        said; \"A comfort of the eye for me and for you. Kill him not, perhaps he maybe of a benefit to us,\r\n        or we may adopt him as a son.\" And they perceived not (the result of that). (Surah 28:9 Quran)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Despite his privileged upbringing, Musa was troubled by the plight of his people. He was aware of his heritage and was deeply disturbed by the injustice and suffering of the Israelites.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And the wife of Pharaoh said, 'I am taking him for myself. He will be a joy of the eye for me and for you. Do not kill him. Perhaps he will benefit us or we may adopt him as a son.'\" <br>(Surah Al-Qasas, 28:9)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Moses and His Mother Reunited</h2>\r\n    <p>The queen summoned a few wet nurses to suckle the baby Moses, but he would not take any of\r\n        their breasts. The queen was distressed and sent for more wet nurses. Moses's sister was also\r\n        worried, as her baby brother was without milk for a long time. Seeing the queen's anxiety, she\r\n        blurted that she knew jut the mother who would suckle the child affectionately.</p>\r\n    <p>They asked her why she was following the floating basket. She said she did so out of curiosity.\r\n        Her excuse sounded reasonable, so they believed her. They ordered her to rush and fetch the\r\n        woman she was talking about. Her mother also was waiting with a heavy heart, worried about the\r\n        fate of her baby. Just then her daughter rushed in with the good news. Her heart lifted and she lost\r\n        no time in reaching the palace. As the child was put to her breast, he immediately started suckling.\r\n        Pharaoh was astonished and asked: \"Who are you? This child has refused to take any other breast\r\n        but yours.\"</p>\r\n    <p>Had she told the truth, Pharaoh would have known that the child was an Israelite and would have\r\n        killed Moses instantly. However, Allah gave her inner strength and she replied: \"I am a woman of\r\n        sweet milk and sweet smell,and no child refuses me.\" This answer satisfied Pharaoh.\r\n        From that day onward, she was appointed as Moses's wet nurse. She continued to breast-feed him\r\n        for a long time. When he was bigger and was weaned, she was allowed the privilege of visiting\r\n        him. Moses was raised in the palace as a prince.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And the heart of the mother of Mûsa (Moses) became empty [from every thought, except the\r\n        thought of Mûsa (Moses)]. She was very near to disclose his (case, i.e. the child is her son), had\r\n        We not strengthened her heart (with Faith), so that she might remain as one of the believers.\r\n        And she said to his [Musa's (Moses)] sister: \"Follow him.\" So she (his sister) watched him from\r\n        a far place secretly, while they perceived not.\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        And We had already forbidden (other) foster suckling mothers for him, until she (his sister came\r\n        up and) said: \"Shall I direct you to a household who will rear him for you, and sincerely they\r\n        will look after him in a good manner?\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        So did We restore him to his mother, that she might be delighted, and that she might not grieve,\r\n        and that she might know that the Promise of Allâh is true. But most of them know not.\" (Surah. 28:\r\n        10-13)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>And when he attained his full strength, and was perfect (in manhood), We bestowed on him\r\n        Hukman (Prophethood, right judgment of the affairs) and religious knowledge (of the religion of\r\n        his forefathers, Islamic Monotheism). And thus do We reward the Muhsineen (good-doers).\" (Surah\r\n        28:14)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Moses Kills and Egyptian</h2>\r\n    <p>Allah had granted Moses (pbuh) good health, strength, knowledge, and wisdom. The weak and\r\n        oppressed turned to him for protection and justice.\r\n        One day in the main city, he saw two men fighting. One was an Israelite, who was being beaten by\r\n        the other, an Egyptian. On seeing Moses, the Israelite begged him for help. Moses became\r\n        involved in the dispute and, in a state of anger, struck a heavy blow on the Egyptian, who died on\r\n        the spot. Upon realizing that he had killed a human being, Moses's heart was filled with deep\r\n        sorrow, and immediately he begged Allah for forgiveness.</p>\r\n    <p>He had not intended to kill the man. He pleaded with Almighty Allah to forgive him, and he felt a\r\n        sense of peace filling his whole being. Thereafter Moses began to show more patience and\r\n        sympathy towards people.</p>\r\n    <p>The next day he saw the same Israelite involved in another fight. Moses went to him and said:\r\n        \"You seem to be a quarrelsome fellow. You have a new quarrel with one person or another each\r\n        day.\" Fearing that Moses might strike him, the Israelite warned Moses: \"Would you kill me as you\r\n        killed the wretch yesterday?\"</p>\r\n    <p>The Egyptian with whom the Israelite was fighting overheard this remark and reported Moses to\r\n        the authorities. Soon thereafter, as Moses was passing through the city, a man approached and\r\n        alerted him: \"O Moses, the chiefs have taken counsel against you. You are to be tried and killed. I\r\n        would advise you to escape.\"</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And he entered the city at a time of unawareness of its people, and he found there two men\r\n        fighting, one of his party (his religion, from the children of Israel), and the other of his foes. The\r\n        man of his own party asked him for help against his foe, so Moses struck him with his fist and\r\n        killed him. He said, \"This is of Satan's doing, verily, he is a plain misleading enemy.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        He said: \"My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, so forgive me.\" Then He forgave him. Verily,\r\n        He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        He said: \"My Lord! For that with which You have favored me, I will never more be a helper for\r\n        the Mujrimeen (criminals, disobedient to Allah, polytheists, sinners, etc.)!\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        So he became afraid, looking about in the city (waiting as to what will be the result of his crime\r\n        of killing), when behold, the man who had sought his help the day before, called for his help\r\n        again. Moses said to him: \"Verily, you are a plain misleader!\" Then when he decided to seize the\r\n        man who was an enemy to both of them, the man said: \"O Moses! Is it your intention to kill me\r\n        as you killed a man yesterday? Your aim is nothing but to become a tyrant in the land, and not to\r\n        be one of those who do right.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        And there came a man running, from the farthest end of the city. He said: \"O Moses! Verily, the\r\n        chiefs are taking counsel together about you, to kill you, so escape. Truly, I am to you of those\r\n        who give sincere advice.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        So he escaped from there, looking about in a state of fear. He said: \"My Lord! Save me from the\r\n        people who are Zalimeen (polytheists, and wrong-doers)!\" (Surah 28:15-21)</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h2>Moses Leaves Egypt</h2>\r\n    <p>Moses left Egypt in a hurry without going to Pharaoh's palace or changing his clothes. Nor was he\r\n        prepared for traveling. He did not have a beast of burden upon which to ride, and he was not in a\r\n        caravan. Instead, he left as soon as the believer came and warned him of Pharaoh's plans.\r\n        He traveled in the direction of the country of Midian, which was the nearest inhabited land\r\n        between Syria and Egypt. His only companion in this hot desert was Allah, and his only provision\r\n        was piety. There was not a single root to pick to lessen his hunger. The hot sand burned the soles\r\n        of his feet. However, fearing pursuit by Pharaoh's men, he forced himself to continue on.</p>\r\n    <p>He traveled for eight nights, hiding during the day. After crossing the main desert, he reached a\r\n        watering hole outside Midian where shepherds were watering their flocks.\r\n        No sooner had Moses reached the Midian than he threw himself under a tree to rest. He suffered\r\n        from hunger and fatigue. The soles of his feet felt as if they were worn out from hard walking on\r\n        sand and rocks and from the dust. He did not have any money to buy a new pair of sandals, nor to\r\n        buy food or drink. Moses noticed a band of shepherds watering their sheep. He went to the\r\n        spring, where he saw two young women preventing their sheep from mixing with the others.\r\n        Moses sensed that the women were in need of help. Forgetting his thirst, he drew nearer to them\r\n        and asked if he could help them in any way.\r\n        The older sister said: \"We are waiting until the shepherds finish watering their sheep, then we will\r\n        water ours.\"</p>\r\n    <p>Moses asked again: \"Why are you waiting?\"</p>\r\n    <p>The younger one: \"We cannot push men.\"</p>\r\n    <p>Moses was surprised that women were shepherding, as only men were supposed to do it. It is\r\n        hard and tiresome work, and one needs to be on the alert. Moses asked: \"Why are you\r\n        shepherding?\"\r\n        The younger sister said: \"Our father is an old man; his health is too poor for him to go outdoors\r\n        for pasturing sheep.\"</p>\r\n    <p>Moses (pbuh) said: \"I will water the sheep for you.\"</p>\r\n    <p>When Moses approached the water, he saw that the shepherds had put over the mouth of the\r\n        spring an immense rock that could only be moved by ten men. Moses embraced the rock and\r\n        lifted it out of the spring's mouth, the veins of his neck and hands standing out as he did so. Moses\r\n        was certainly strong. He watered their sheep and put the rock back in its place.\r\n        He returned to sit in the shade of the tree. At this moment he realized that he had forgotten to\r\n        drink. His stomach was sunken because of hunger. Almighty Allah described this event:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And when he arrived at the water of Midian (Midyan) he found there a group of men watering\r\n        their flocks, and besides them he found two women who were keeping back their flocks. He said:\r\n        \"What is the matter with you?\" They said: \"We cannot water (our flocks) until the shepherds take\r\n        their flocks. And our father is a very old man.\"\r\n        So he watered their flocks for them, then he turned back to shade, and said: \"My Lord! Truly, I\r\n        am in need of whatever good that You bestow on me!\" (Surah 28:22-24)</blockquote>\r\n    \r\n    <h2>Moses Becomes a Shepherd</h2>\r\n    <p>The young ladies returned home earlier than usual, which surprised their father. They related the\r\n        incident at the spring which was the reason that they were back early. Their father sent one of his\r\n        daughters to invite the stranger to his home. Bashfully, the woman approached Moses and\r\n        delivered the message. \"My father is grateful for what you have done for us. He invites you to our\r\n        home so that he may thank you personally.\"\r\n        Moses welcomed this invitation and accompanied the maiden to her father. Moses could see that\r\n        they lived comfortably as a happy and peaceful household. He introduced himself and told the old\r\n        man about the misfortune that he had befallen him and had compelled him to flee from Egypt. The\r\n        old man comforted him: \"Fear not, you have escaped from the wrong-doers.\"\r\n        Moses's gentle behavior was noticed by the father and his daughters. The kind man invited him to\r\n        stay with them. Moses felt at home with this happy household, for they were friendly and feared\r\n        Allah.</p>\r\n    <p>One of the daughters suggested to her father that he employ Moses, as he was strong and\r\n        trustworthy. They needed someone like him, especially at the water hole, which was visited by\r\n        ruffians.\r\n        The father asked her how she could be sure of his trustworthiness in such a short time. She\r\n        replied: \"When I bade him to follow me to our home, he insisted that I walk behind him so he\r\n        would not observe my form (to avoid sexual attraction).\"</p>\r\n    <p>The old man was pleased to hear this. He approached Moses and said: \"I wish to marry you to\r\n        one of my daughters on condition that you agree to work for me for a period of eight years.\"\r\n        This offer suited Moses well, for being a stranger in this country, he would soon have to search\r\n        for shelter, and work. Moses married the Midianite's daughter and looked after the old man's\r\n        animals for ten long years. Almighty Allah recounted:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Then there came to him one of the two women, walking shyly. She said: \"Verily, my father calls\r\n        you that he may reward you for having watered our flocks for us.\" So when he came to him and\r\n        narrated the story, he said; \"Fear you not. You have escaped from the people who are Zalimeen\r\n        (polytheists, disbeliveers, and wrong-doers).\" And said one of them (the two women): \"O my\r\n        father! Hire him! Verily, the best of men for you to hire is the strong, the trustworthy.\" He said:\r\n        \"I intend to wed one of these two daughters of mine to you, on condition that you serve me for\r\n        eight years, but if you complete ten years, it will be a favor from you. But I intend not to place\r\n        you under a difficulty. If Allah wills, you will find me one of the righteous.\" He (Moses) said:\r\n        \"That is settled between me and you whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there will be no injustice\r\n        to me, and Allah is Surety over what we say.\" (Surah 28:25-28)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Call to Prophethood</h2>\r\n    <p>Time passed, and he lived in seclusion far from his family and his people. This period of ten years\r\n        was of importance in his life. It was a period of major preparation. Certainly Moses's mind was\r\n        absorbed in the stars every night. He followed the sunrise and the sunset every day. He pondered\r\n        on the plant and how it splits and soil and appears thereafter. He contemplated water and how the\r\n        earth is revived by it and flourishes after its death.\r\n        Of course, he was immersed in the Glorious Book of Allah, open to the insight and heart. He was\r\n        immersed in the existence of Allah. All these became latent within him. The religion of Moses\r\n        (pbuh) was the same as that of Jacob (pbuh), which was Islamic monotheism. His forefather was\r\n        Jacob (pbuh) the grandson of Abraham (pbuh). Moses (pbuh), therefore, was one of the\r\n        descendants of Abraham (pbuh) and every prophet who came after Abraham was one of\r\n        Abraham's successors. In addition to physical preparation, there was a similar spiritual\r\n        preparation. It was made in complete seclusion, in the middle of the desert, and in the places of\r\n        pasture. Silence was his way of life, and seclusion was his vehicle. Allah the Almighty prepared\r\n        for His prophet the tools he would need later on to righteously bear the commands of Allah the\r\n        Exalted.</p>\r\n    <p>One day after the end of this period, a vague homesickness arose in Moses's heart. He wanted to\r\n        return to Egypt. He was fast and firm in making his decision, telling his wife: \"Tomorrow we shall\r\n        leave for Egypt.\" His wife said to herself. \"There are a thousand dangers in departing that have\r\n        not yet been revealed.\" However, she obeyed her husband.</p>\r\n    <p>Moses himself did not know the secret of the quick and sudden decision to return to Egypt. After\r\n        all, he had fled from their ten years ago with a price on his head. Why should he go back now?\r\n        Did he look forward to seeing his mother and brother? Did he think of visiting Pharaoh's wife who\r\n        had raised him and who loved him as if she were his mother?\r\n        No one knows what went through Moses's mind when he returned to Egypt. All we know is that\r\n        a mute obedience to Allah's destinies impelled him to make a decision and he did. These supreme\r\n        destinies steered his steps towards a matter of great importance.</p>\r\n    <p>Moses left Midian with his family and traveled through the desert until he reached Mount Sinai.\r\n        There Moses discovered that he had lost his way. He sought Allah's direction and was shown the\r\n        right course. At nightfall they reached Mount Tur. Moses noticed a fire in the distance. \"I shall\r\n        fetch a firebrand to warm us.\"</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"When he saw the fire and said, 'O my people, I see the light of the fire on the mountain, I will go and see what it is. Perhaps it is something useful.'\" <br>(Surah Al-Qasas, 28:29)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>As he neared the fire, he heard a sonorous voice calling him: \"O Moses, I am Allah, the Lord of\r\n        the Universe.\" Moses was bewildered and looked around. He again heard the strange voice. \"And\r\n        what is in you right hand, O Moses?\"</p>\r\n    <p>Shivering, Moses answered: \"This is my staff on which I lean, and with which I beat down\r\n        branches for my sheep, and for which I find other uses.\" (This question was asked so that Moses'\r\n        attention would focus on the staff and to prepare him for the miracle which was to happen. This\r\n        was the beginning of Moses's mission as a prophet -pbuh).\r\n        The same voice commanded him: \"Throw down your staff!\" He did so, and at once the staff\r\n        became a wriggling snake. Moses turned to run, but the voice again addressed him: \"Fear not and\r\n        grasp it; We shall return it to its former state.\" The snake changed back into his staff. Moses's fear\r\n        subsided and was replaced by peace, for he realized that he was witnessing the Truth.\r\n        Next, Allah commanded him to thrust his hand into his robe at the armpit. When he pulled it out,\r\n        the hand had a brilliant shine. Allah then commanded Moses; \"You have two signs from Your\r\n        Lord; go to Pharaoh and his chiefs, for they are an evil gang and have transgressed all bounds.\"\r\n        However, Moses feared that he would be arrested by Pharaoh, so he turned to Allah saying: \"My\r\n        Lord! I have killed a man among them and I fear that they will kill me.\"\r\n        Allah assured him of his safety and set his heart at rest. Almighty Allah narrated this event:</p>\r\n        <blockquote>\"And has there come to you the story of Moses? When he saw a fire, he said to his family: \"Wait!\r\n            Verily, I have seen a fire, perhaps I can bring you some burning brand therefrom, or find some\r\n            guidance at the fire.\"\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            And when he came to it the fire, he was called by name: \"O Moses! Verily! I am your Lord! So\r\n            take off your shoes, you are in the sacred valley, Tuwa. And I have chosen you. So listen to that\r\n            which is inspired to you. Verily! I am Allah! La ilaha illa Ana (none has the right to be\r\n            worshipped but I), so worship Me, and offer prayers perfectly, for My Remembrance. Verily, the\r\n            Hour is coming - and My Will is to keep it hidden - that every person may be rewarded for that\r\n            which he strives. Therefore, let the one who believes not therein (in the Day of Resurrection,\r\n            Reckoning, Paradise and Hell etc) but follows his own lusts, divert your therefrom lest you\r\n            perish. And what is that in your right hand, O Moses?\"\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            He said: \"This is my stick, whereon I lean, and wherewith I beat down branches for my sheep\r\n            and wherein I find other uses.\"\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Allah said: \"Cast it down, O Moses!\"\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            He cast it down, and behold! It was a snake, moving quickly.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Allah said: \"Grasp it, and fear not, We shall return it to its former state, and press your right\r\n            hand to your left side, it will come forth white and shining, and without any disease as another\r\n            sign, that We may show you some of Our Greater Signs.\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            \"Go To Pharaoh! Verily! He has transgressed (all bounds in disbelief and disobedience, and has\r\n            behaved as an arrogant, and as a tyrant).\" (Surah. 20: 9-24)</blockquote>\r\n        \r\n        <blockquote>Moses said: \"O my Lord! Open for me my chest (grant me self-confidence, contentment, and\r\n            boldness). And ease my task for me; and make loose the knot (the defect) from my tongue,\r\n            (remove the incorrectness of my speech) that they understand my speech, and appoint for me a\r\n            helper from my family, Aaron, my brother; increase my strength with him, and let him share my\r\n            task (of conveying Allah's Message and Prophethood), and we may glorify You much, and\r\n            remember You much, Verily! You are of us Ever a Well-Seer.\"\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            Allah said: \"You are granted your request, O Moses! And indeed We conferred a favor on you\r\n            another time before. When We inspired your mother with that which We inspired, saying: \"Put\r\n            him (the child) into the Tabut (a box or a case or a chest) and put him into the river (Nile), and\r\n            then the river shall cast it up on the bank, and there, an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his shall\r\n            take him.' And I endured you with love from Me, in order that you maybe brought up under My\r\n            Eye, when your sister went and said; \"Shall I show you one who will nurse him?' So We restored\r\n            you to your mother, that she might cool her eyes and she should not grieve. Then you did kill a\r\n            man, but We saved you from a great distress and tried you with a heavy trial. Then you stayed a\r\n            number of years witthe people of Midian. Then you came here according to the term which I\r\n            ordained (for you), O Moses!\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            \"And I have Istana'tuka (chosen you for My Inspiration and My Message) for Myself.

And speak to him mildly, perhaps he\r\n            may accept admonition or fear Allah.\"\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            They said: \"Our Lord! Verily! We fear lest he should hasten to punish us or lest he should\r\n            transgress all bounds against us.\"\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            He (Allah) said: \"Fear not, Verily!

And peace will be upon\r\n            him who follows the guidance! Truly, it has been revealed to us that the torment will be for him\r\n            who denies (believes not in the Oneness of Allah, and in His Messengers, etc), and turns away'\r\n            (from the truth, and obedience of Allah).\" (Surah 20:9-48).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Confrontation with Pharaoh</h2>\r\n    <p>Upon returning to Egypt, Musa, accompanied by his brother Harun (Aaron), approached Pharaoh with Allah’s command. Musa called Pharaoh to worship Allah alone and to release the Israelites from slavery. He performed miracles, including turning his staff into a serpent and causing his hand to shine brightly, as signs of his divine mission.</p>\r\n    <p>Moses (pbuh) and Aaron (pbuh) went together to Pharaoh and delivered their message. Moses\r\n        spoke to him about Allah, His mercy and His Paradise and about the obligations of monotheism\r\n        and His worship.\r\n        Pharaoh listened to Moses' speech with disdain. He thought that Moses was crazy because he\r\n        dared to question his supreme position. Then he raised his hand and asked: \"What do you want?\"\r\n        Moses answered: \"I want you to send the children of Israel with us.\"\r\n        Pharaoh asked: \"Why should I send them, as they are my slaves?\"\r\n        Moses replied: \"They are the slaves of Allah, Lord of the Worlds.\"\r\n        Pharaoh then inquired sarcastically if his name was Moses. Moses said \"Yes.\"\r\n        \"Are you not the Moses whom we picked up from the Nile as a helpless baby? Are you not the\r\n        Moses whom we reared in this palace, who ate and drank from our provisions and whom our\r\n        wealth showered with charity? Are you not the Moses who is a fugitive, the killer of an Egyptian\r\n        man, if my memory does not betray me? It is said that killing is an act of disbelief. Therefore, you\r\n        were a disbeliever when you killed. You are a fugitive from justice and you come to speak to me!\r\n        What were you talking about Moses, I forgot?\"\r\n        Moses knew that Pharaoh's mentioning his past, his upbringing, and his receiving Pharaoh's\r\n        charity was Pharaoh's way of threatening him. Moses ignored his sarcasm and explained that he\r\n        was not a disbeliever when he killed the Egyptian, he only went astray and Allah the Almighty had\r\n        not yet given him the revelation at that time. He made Pharaoh understand that he fled from Egypt\r\n        because he was afraid of their revenge upon him, even though the killing was an accident. He\r\n        informed him that Allah had granted him forgiveness and made him one of the messengers. Allah the Almighty revealed to us part of the dialogue between Moses (pbuh) and Pharaoh:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Allah said: \"Nay! Go you both with Our Signs, Verily! We shall be with you, listening. And\r\n        when you both come to Pharaoh, say: \"We are the Messengers of the Lord of the Alamin\r\n        (mankind, jinn and all that exists), and So allow the children of Israel to go with us.\"\"\r\n        Pharaoh said to Moses: \"Did we not bring you up among us as a child ? And you did dwell many\r\n        years of your life with us. And you did your deed which you did (the crime of killing a man) and\r\n        you are one of the ingrates.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Moses said: \"I did it then, when I was an ignorant (as regards my Lord and His Message). So I\r\n        fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukman (religious knowledge,\r\n        right judgments of the affairs and Prophethood), and appointed me as one of the Messengers.\r\n        And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, and that you have enslaved the children\r\n        of Israel.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Pharaoh said: \"And what is the Lord of the Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)?\"\r\n        Moses replied: \"Lord of the heavens, and the earth, and all that is between them, if you seek to\r\n        be convinced with certainty.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Pharaoh said to those around: \"Do you not hear what he says?\"\r\n        Moses said: \"Your Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers!\"\r\n        Pharaoh said: \"Verily, your Messenger who has been sent to you is a madman!\"\r\n        Moses said: \"Lord of the east, and the west, and all that is between them, if you did but\r\n        understand!\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Pharaoh said: \"If you choose an ilah (a god) other than me, I will certainly put you among the\r\n        prisoners.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Moses said: \"Even if I bring you something manifest (and convincing).\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Pharaoh said: \"Bring it forth then, if you are of the truthful!\" (Surah 26:16-31)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The degree of the conflict expressed in this dialogue reached its apex; thus, the tone of dialogue\r\n        changed. Moses used a convincing intellectual argument against Pharaoh. However, Pharaoh\r\n        escaped from the circle of dialogue based on the logic and began a dialogue of another type, a\r\n        type which Moses could not bear to follow; a dialogue of menacing and threatening. Pharaoh\r\n        deliberately adopted the style of the absolute ruler. He asked Moses how he dared to worship\r\n        Allah! Did he not know that Pharaoh was a god?\r\n        After declaring his divinity, Pharaoh asked Moses how he dared to worship another god. The\r\n        punishment for this crime was imprisonment. It was not permitted for anyone to worship anyone\r\n        other than the Pharaoh. Moses understood that the intellectual arguments did not succeed. The\r\n        calm dialogue was converted from sarcasm to mentioning charity, then to scorn, then to the threat\r\n        of imprisonment.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>Moses said: \"Even if I bring you something manifest and convincing.\" Pharaoh said; \"Bring it\r\n        forth, then, if you are of the truthful!\" So Moses threw his stick, and behold, it was a serpent,\r\n        manifest. And he drew out his hand, and behold, it was white to all beholders! (Surah 26:30-33)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Pharaoh's amazement turned to terror. Fearing that his rule was in danger, he addressed his\r\n        advisors: \"These are two wizards who will strip you of your best traditions and drive you of the\r\n        country with their magic. What do you advise?\" they counseled Pharaoh to detain Moses and his\r\n        brother while they summoned the cleverest magicians in the country. Then they too, could show\r\n        their skills of magic and change sticks into serpents. In this way they sought to reduce the\r\n        influence of Moses's miracles on the masses.\r\n        Pharaoh detained Moses and Aaron. He dispatched couriers all o ver the land to enlist the best\r\n        magicians. He offered each successful magician a big reward, including appointment as a royal\r\n        courtier. On the customary festival day, which attracted citizens from all over the Egyptian\r\n        empire, Pharaoh arranged for a public contest between Moses and the magicians. The people\r\n        came in droves as near before when they heard of the greatest contest ever between Pharaoh's\r\n        many magicians and a single man who claimed to be a prophet. They had also heard of a baby\r\n        who had once floated down the river Nile in a basket, landed on Pharaoh's palace grounds, been\r\n        reared as a prince, and who later had fled for killing an Egyptian with a single blow.\r\n        Everyone was eager and excited to watch this great contest. Before it began, Moses arose. There\r\n        was a hush in the huge crowd. Moses addressed the magicians. \"Woe unto you, if you invent a lie\r\n        against Allah by calling His miracles magic and by not being honest with the Pharaoh. Woe unto\r\n        you, if you do not know the difference between the truth and falsehood. Allah will destroy you\r\n        with His punishment, for he who lies against Allah fails miserably.\"\r\n        Moses had spoke sincerely and made the magicians think. But they were overwhelmed by their\r\n        greed for money and glory. They hoped to impress the people with their magic and to expose\r\n        Moses as a fraud and a cheat.\r\n        Moses asked the magicians to perform first. They threw their magical objects down on the\r\n        ground. Their staffs and ropes took the forms of wriggling serpents while the crowd watched in\r\n        amazement. Pharaoh and his men applauded loudly. Then Moses threw his staff. It began to\r\n        wriggle vand became an enormous serpent. The people stood up, craning their necks for a better\r\n        view. Pharaoh and his men sat silently as, one by one, Moses's huge serpent swallowed all the\r\n        snakes. Moses bent to pick it up, and it became a staff in his hand.\r\n        The crowd rose like a great wave, shouting and screaming with excitement. A wonder like this\r\n        had never been seen before! On witnessing the power of Moses, the magicians prostrated\r\n        themselves to Allah, declaring: \"We believe in the Lord of Moses and Aaron.\" Pharaoh was angry\r\n        and began plotting his next move. He charged that the demonstration had been arranged secretly\r\n        between Moses and the magicians. He demanded that the magicians confess to their scheme,\r\n        threatening them with death. They refused to denounce Allah and stuck to their sincerity of their\r\n        belief. No longer hiding his cruel nature, Pharaoh threatened to cut off their hands and feet and to\r\n        crucify them on the trunks of palm trees as an example to his subjects. Almighty Allah recounted this event:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"He (Pharaoh) said: \"Have you come to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Moses?\r\n        Then verily, we can produce magic the like thereof; so appoint a meeting between us and you,\r\n        which neither we, nor you shall fail to keep, in an open wide place where both shall have a just\r\n        and equal chance (and beholders could witness the competition).\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Moses said: \"your appointed meeting is the day of the festival, and let the people assemble when\r\n        the sun has risen (forenoon).\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n\r\n        So Pharaoh withdrew, devised his plot and then came back. Moses said to them: \"Woe unto you!\r\n        Invent not a lie against Allah, lest He should destroy you completely by a torment. And surely, he\r\n        who invents a lie (against Allah) will fail miserably.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Then they debated with one another what they must do, and they kept their talk secret. They said:\r\n        \"Verily! There are two magicians. Their object is to drive you out from your land with magic and\r\n        overcome your chiefs and nobles. So devise your plot, and then assemble in line. And whoever\r\n        overcomes this day will be indeed successful.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        They said: \"O Moses! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw?\"\r\n        Moses said: \"nay, throw you (first)!\" Then behold, their ropes and their sticks, by their magic,\r\n        appeared to him as though they moved fast. So Moses conceived a fear in himself.\r\n        We (Allah) said: \"Fear not! Surely, you will have the upper hand. Throw that which is in your\r\n        right hand! It will swallow up that which they have made. That which they have made is only a\r\n        magician's trick, and the magician will never be successful, no matter whatever amount of skill\r\n        he may attain.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        So the magicians fell down prostrate. They said :\"We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.\"\r\n        Pharaoh said: \"Believe you in him (Moses) before I give you permission? Verily! He is your\r\n        chief who taught you magic. So I will surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I\r\n        will surely crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and you shall surely know which of us (I\r\n        Pharaoh,) or the Lord of (Moses) (Allah), can give the severe and more lasting torment.\"\r\n        They said: \"We prefer you not over the clear signs that have come to us, and to Him (Allah) Who\r\n        created us. So decree (regarding) this life of the world. Verily! We have believed in our Lord,\r\n        that He may forgive us our faults, and the magic to which you did compel us. And Allah is better\r\n        as regards reward in comparison to your (Pharaoh's) reward, and more lasting (as regards\r\n        punishment in comparison to you punishment).\" \r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Verily! Whoever comes to his Lord as a Mujrim (criminal, polytheist, disbeliever, in the Oneness\r\n        of Allah and His Messengers, sinner, etc.), then surely, for him is Hell, therein he will neither die\r\n        nor live.\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        But whoever comes to Him (Allah) as a believer (in the Oneness of Allah, etc.), and has done\r\n        righteous good deeds, for such are the high ranks (in the Hereafter), - Everlasting Gardens (And\r\n        Paradise), under which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever; such is the reward of those\r\n        who purify themselves (by abstaining from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which Allah has\r\n        forbidden and by doing all that which Allah has ordained). (Surah 20:58-76).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The magicians represented the elite of the Egyptian society. They were its scholars. They\r\n        prostrated before righteousness, but the people abandoned them and left them to their fate. The\r\n        path of righteousness was plain, but in spite of this, the people did nothing but stand by and\r\n        watch.</p>\r\n    <p>If every one of the Egyptians had stopped to pick up a piece of brick and had thrown it at\r\n        Pharaoh, he would have fallen dead and the history of Egypt would have been changed.</p>\r\n    <p>This obviously did not happen. None of the people moved. Each one stood motionless in his\r\n        place. The people did nothing but watch, and they paid the price of this inactivity: they were\r\n        drowned later as the price for the cowardice of one day.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>Pharaoh, however, rejected Musa’s message and demanded further signs. He accused Musa of being a magician and refused to release the Israelites. Despite the miracles, Pharaoh’s arrogance and obstinacy led him to ignore the clear signs from Allah.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And [Musa] said, 'O Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds. It is incumbent upon me to say nothing about Allah except the truth.'\" <br>(Surah Al-A'raf, 7:104)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Plagues and the Exodus</h2>\r\n    <p>In response to Pharaoh’s refusal, Allah sent a series of devastating plagues upon Egypt, each one a sign of divine wrath and a warning to Pharaoh. These plagues included:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Blood:</strong> The Nile River turned into blood, affecting the water supply and causing widespread distress.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Frogs:</strong> An overwhelming number of frogs infested the land, causing great discomfort.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Lice or Gnats:</strong> A plague of lice or gnats afflicted both people and animals.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Flies:</strong> Swarms of flies caused further suffering and disruption.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Livestock Disease:</strong> The Egyptian livestock was struck with a severe disease, leading to widespread death of animals.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Boils:</strong> Painful boils broke out on the bodies of the Egyptians.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Hail:</strong> A violent hailstorm destroyed crops and property.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Locusts:</strong> Locusts devoured any remaining vegetation.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Darkness:</strong> A palpable darkness covered Egypt for three days.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Death of the Firstborn:</strong> The final and most severe plague resulted in the death of the firstborn sons of the Egyptians.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And indeed We punished the people of Pharaoh with years of drought, and shortness of fruits\r\n        (crops, etc.), that they mighty remember (take heed). But whenever good came to them, they\r\n        said: \"Ours is this.\" And if evil athem, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses and\r\n        those with him. Be informed! Verily, their evil omens are with Allah but most of them know not.\r\n        They said to Moses: \"Whatever Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.)\r\n        you may bring to us, to work therewith your sorcery on us, we shall never believe in you.\" So We\r\n        sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, and the blood: (as a succession of)\r\n        manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were Mujrimeen\r\n        (criminals, polytheists, sinners, etc.) (Surah 7:130-133)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Each time Pharaoh would promise to release the Israelites, only to break his promise once the plague was removed. Finally, after the death of the firstborns, Pharaoh relented and allowed the Israelites to leave Egypt.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Pharaoh became ruder and more arrogant. He proclaimed to his people. \"Pharaoh is the only god.\r\n        Has he not the kingdom of Egypt and rivers flowing under it?\" He declared that Moses was a liar,\r\n        a magician, and a poor man who did not wear even one bracelet of gold.\r\n        Almighty Allah declared:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>“And indeed We did sent Moses with Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs,\r\n        revelations, etc.) to Pharaoh and his chiefs (inviting them to Allah's Religion of Islam). He said:\r\n        \"Verily! I am a Messenger of the Lord of the Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        But when he came to them with our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations,\r\n        etc.) behold! They laughed at them. And not an Ayah (sign, etc.) We showed them but it was\r\n        greater than its fellow, and We seized them with torment in order that they might turn from their\r\n        polytheism to Allah's Religion (Islamic Monotheism).\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        And they said to Moses: \"O you sorcerer! Invoke your Lord for us according to what He has\r\n        covenanted with you. Verily, we shall guide ourselves aright.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        But when We removed the torment from them, behold! They broke their covenant (that they will\r\n        believe if We remove the torment for them).\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        And Pharaoh proclaimed among his people, saying \"O my people! Is not mine the dominion of\r\n        Egypt, and the rivers flowing underneath me. See you not then? Am I not better than this one\r\n        (Moses), and who is Mahin (has no honor nor any respect, and is weak, and despicable) and can\r\n        scarcely express himself clearly? Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him, or angels\r\n        sent along with him?\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Thus he (Pharaoh) befooled and misled his people, and they obeyed him. Verily, they were\r\n        Fasiqeen (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        So When they angered Us, We punished them, and drowned them all. And We made them a\r\n        precedent (as a lesson for those coming after them), and an example to later generations. (Surah\r\n        43:46-56).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>It appeared that Pharaoh would never believe in Moses' s message, nor would he stop the torture\r\n        of the children of Israel. Therefore, Moses prayed to his Lord thus:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Our Lord! You have indeed bestowed on Pharaoh and his chiefs splendor and wealth in the life\r\n        of this world, our Lord! That they may lead men astray from Your Path. Our Lord! Destroy their\r\n        wealth, and harden their hearts, so that they will not believe until they see the painful torment.\"\r\n        Allah said: \"Verily, the invocation of you both is accepted. So you both keep to the Straight Way\r\n        (keep on doing good deeds, and preaching Allah's Message with patience), and follow not the\r\n        path of those who know not (the truth, to believe in the Oneness of Allah, and also to believe in\r\n        the Reward of Allah: Paradise etc.).\" (Surah 10:88-89)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Allah inspired Moses to conduct his people of Egypt, but only a few of his people believed in his\r\n        message. Allah revealed:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"But none believed in Moses except the offspring of his people, because of the fear of Pharaoh\r\n        and his chiefs lest they should persecute them; and verily, Pharaoh was an arrogant tyrant on\r\n        the earth, he was indeed one of the Musrifeen (polytheists, sinners, and transgressors, those who\r\n        give up the truth and follow the evil, and commit all kinds of great sins).\r\n        And Moses said: \"O my people! If you have believed in Allah, then put your trust in Him if you\r\n        are Muslims (those who submit to Allah's Will).\"\r\n        They said: \"In Allah we put our trust. Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the folk who are\r\n        zalimeen (polytheists, and wrong-doing) (do not make them overpower us). And save us by Your\r\n        Mercy from the disbelieving folk.\" (Surah 10:83-86).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Almighty Allah decided to put an end to Pharaoh's crimes after He had given him several chances.\r\n        Allah commanded Moses to depart, and the children of Israel received reluctant permission from\r\n        the Pharaoh to go out of the city for the feast. They prepared themselves to leave Egypt. This\r\n        later became known as Exodus. They carried with them their jewels and borrowed a lot of jewels\r\n        from the Egyptians.</p>\r\n    <p>In the darkness of night, Moses led his people towards the Red Sea, and in the morning they\r\n        reached the beach. By then Pharaoh was aware of their departure, so he mobilized a huge army to\r\n        pursue them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>Musa led the Israelites in a dramatic escape, known as the Exodus. As they fled, Pharaoh’s army pursued them. When they reached the Red Sea, Allah commanded Musa to strike the sea with his staff. The waters parted, allowing the Israelites to cross safely. When Pharaoh and his army followed, the sea returned to its normal state, drowning the Egyptian forces.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Then We inspired to Musa, 'Strike with your staff the sea.' And thereupon there were twelve pathways and each was like a mountain.\" <br>(Surah Ash-Shu'ara, 26:63)\r\n    <br/>\r\n    <br/>\r\n    \"But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach,\r\n    behold! They broke their word! (Surah 7:135)\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And We inspired Moses, saying: \"Take away My slaves by night, verily, you will be pursued.\"\r\n        Then Pharaoh sent callers to all the cities. Saying: \"Verily! These indeed are but a small band.\r\n        And verily, they have done what has enraged us; but we are host all assembled, amply\r\n        fore-warned.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        So, We expelled them from gardens and springs, treasures, and every kind of honorable place.\r\n        Thus (We turned them Pharaoh's people) out, and We caused the children of Israel to inherit\r\n        them.\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        So they pursued them at sunrise. And when the two hosts saw each other, the people of Moses\r\n        said: \"We are sure to be overtaken.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Moses said: \"Nay, verily! With me is my Lord, He will guide me.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Then We inspired Moses saying: \"Strike the sea with your stick.\" And it parted, and each\r\n        separate (part of that sea water) became like the huge, firm mass of a mountain.\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Then We brought near the others (Pharaoh's party) to that place. And We saved Moses and all\r\n        those with him. Then We drowned the others. Verily! In this is indeed a sign (or a proof), yet\r\n        most of them are not believers. And verily, your Lord! He is truly the All-Mighty, the Most\r\n        Merciful.\" (Surah 26:52-68)</blockquote>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And We took the children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh with his hosts followed them in\r\n        oppression and enmity, till when drowning overtook him, he sai: \"I believe that La ilaha illa\r\n        huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but) He, in whom the children of Israel believe, and I\r\n        am one of the Muslims (those who submit to Allah's Will).\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Now (you believe) while you refused to believe before and you were one of the mufsideen\r\n        (evildoers, corrupts, etc.). So this day We shall deliver your dead body out from the sea that you\r\n        maybe a sign to those who come after you!

(Surah 10:90-92)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Revelation of the Torah and the Covenant</h2>\r\n    <p>After the Exodus, Musa led the Israelites to Mount Sinai, where Allah revealed the Torah. This scripture provided comprehensive guidance on religious, social, and legal matters, and established the laws that the Israelites were to follow. Musa spent forty days and nights on the mountain receiving these divine instructions.</p>\r\n    <p>During his absence, some Israelites fell into idolatry, worshiping a golden calf. This act of disobedience caused Musa great distress upon his return. He confronted the idolaters and sought forgiveness from Allah on their behalf. Allah forgave the repentant but imposed a punishment on those who persisted in their disobedience.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And [Musa] chose seventy men from his people for an appointment with Allah. When the quake took them, he said, 'My Lord, if You had willed, You could have destroyed them before and me too.'\" <br>(Surah Al-A'raf, 7:155)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The curtain fell on Pharaoh's tyranny, and the waves threw his corpse up to the western seashore.\r\n        The Egyptians saw him and knew that their god whom they worshipped and obeyed were mere\r\n        slaves who could not keep death away from their own necks.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Journey through the Desert</h2>\r\n    <p>Following the revelation of the Torah, Musa led the Israelites on their journey through the desert towards the Promised Land. The journey was marked by numerous trials, including scarcity of food and water. Despite their hardships, the Israelites often showed ingratitude and questioned Musa’s leadership.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\" And remember when Moses said to his people: \"O my people! Remember the Favor of Allah to\r\n        you, when He made Prophets among you, made you kings, and gave you what He had not give to\r\n        any other among the Alamin (mankind and jinn), in the past. O my people! Enter the holy land\r\n        (Palestine) which Allah has assigned to you and turn not back in flight for then you will be\r\n        returned as losers.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        They said: \"O Moses! In it (this holy land) are a people of great strength, and we shall never\r\n        enter it, till they leave it; when they leave, then we will enter.\"\r\n        Two men of those who feared Allah and in whom Allah had His Grace said: \"Assault them\r\n        through the gate, for when you are in, victory will be yours, and put your trust in Allah if you are\r\n        believers indeed.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        They said: \"O Moses! We shall never enter it as long as they are there. So go you, and your Lord\r\n        and fight you two, we are sitting right here.\" (Surah. 5: 20-24)</blockquote>\r\n        <blockquote>He (Moses) said: \"O my Lord! I have power only over myself and my brother, so separate us\r\n            from the people who are the Fasiqeen (rebellious and disobedient to Allah)!\"\r\n            Allah said: \"Therefore it (this holy land) is forbidden to them for forty years; in distraction they\r\n            will wander through the land. So be not sorrowful over the people who are the Fasiqeen\r\n            (rebellious and disobedient to Allah).\" (Surah 5:20-26)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Musa’s patience was tested as he dealt with the frequent complaints and challenges of his people. His leadership was crucial in maintaining their faith and guiding them through their trials. Despite the difficulties, Musa remained steadfast in his mission to lead his people to the land promised to them by Allah.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Legacy of Prophet Musa</h2>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Say: \"Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship\r\n        with Him; be good and dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty- We\r\n        provide sustenance for you and for them; come not near to shameful sins (illegal sexual\r\n        intercourse, etc.) whether committed openly or secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allah has\r\n        forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law). This He has commanded you that\r\n        you may understand. And come not near to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he\r\n        or she attains the age of full strength; and give full measure and full weight with justice. We\r\n        burden not any person but that which he can bear. And whenever you give your word (judge\r\n        between men or give evidences, etc.) , say the truth even if a near relative is concerned, and\r\n        fulfill the Covenant of Allah. This He commands you, that you may remember.\" (Surah 6:151-152).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The story of Prophet Musa encompasses several key lessons and themes:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Faith and Trust in Allah:</strong> Musa’s unwavering faith in Allah and his trust in divine guidance are central to his story. His ability to remain steadfast in his mission despite numerous challenges highlights the importance of faith and trust in Allah’s plan.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Leadership and Perseverance:</strong> Musa’s leadership in guiding the Israelites through their trials, including the Exodus and the desert journey, exemplifies qualities of perseverance, patience, and responsibility. His story underscores the importance of righteous leadership and enduring faith.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Divine Intervention and Miracles:</strong> The miracles granted to Musa, such as the parting of the Red Sea and the plagues, demonstrate Allah’s power and the concept of divine intervention. These events serve as a reminder of Allah’s ability to provide support and deliverance in times of need.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Obedience and Repentance:</strong> The story illustrates the consequences of disobedience and the importance of repentance. The Israelites’ experiences emphasize the need for humility, faith, and adherence to divine guidance.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Endurance and Hope:</strong> Musa’s journey through the desert and the Israelites’ trials underscore the value of endurance and the importance of maintaining hope and faith during times of difficulty and testing.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>Prophet Musa’s story is a profound narrative that continues to offer valuable lessons on faith, leadership, and perseverance.

He played a significant role as a prophet and a supportive figure to Musa in his mission to liberate the Children of Israel from the tyranny of Pharaoh. Harun’s story is intertwined with Musa’s, reflecting his important role in the divine narrative of delivering Allah's message.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Early Life and Family</h2>\r\n    <p>Harun was born to the family of Imran, which was part of the Israelite community living in Egypt under the oppressive rule of Pharaoh. His early life was marked by the harsh conditions imposed by Pharaoh, who had decreed the killing of all newborn Israelite males to suppress their population.</p>\r\n    <p>Harun, being the older brother, was raised in an environment of constant hardship but maintained his faith and identity. He and Musa grew up in Pharaoh's palace after Musa was adopted by Pharaoh’s wife, Asiya. Despite their upbringing in the palace, their hearts remained aligned with their people’s struggles and the divine mission Allah had planned for them.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Call to Prophethood and Mission</h2>\r\n    <p>When Allah chose Musa as a prophet to lead the Israelites and confront Pharaoh, Harun was also designated as a prophet to assist Musa. Allah appointed Harun as a spokesperson and supporter to ensure that Musa’s message would be communicated effectively to Pharaoh and the Israelites.</p>\r\n    <p>Harun’s role was critical in the mission to confront Pharaoh. He was not only a brother in faith but also a trusted ally who helped articulate the divine message. Together, they faced the challenge of convincing the tyrant Pharaoh to release the Israelites and recognize the power of Allah.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And [Allah] said, 'Go, both of you, to the people who have exceeded the limits. The people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear Allah?'\" <br>(Surah At-Tahrim, 66:17)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Role During the Plagues and Exodus</h2>\r\n    <p>As Musa and Harun presented their message to Pharaoh, they performed various miracles as signs from Allah, including turning Musa’s staff into a serpent and making his hand shine brightly. Despite these signs, Pharaoh remained obstinate, leading to a series of divine plagues inflicted upon Egypt to demonstrate Allah’s power and warning to Pharaoh.</p>\r\n    <p>Harun’s support during this period was vital, as he stood by Musa in his efforts to deliver Allah’s message and challenge Pharaoh’s arrogance. The plagues, including the turning of water into blood, infestations of frogs, lice, and locusts, and the final plague of the death of the firstborns, were a testament to Allah’s might and the seriousness of Musa and Harun’s mission.</p>\r\n    <p>When Pharaoh finally relented and allowed the Israelites to leave Egypt, Harun played a key role in guiding and leading the people during their exodus. His leadership was crucial in maintaining order and morale as they embarked on their journey towards freedom.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And [Musa] said, 'O Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds. It is incumbent upon me to say nothing about Allah except the truth.'\" <br>(Surah Al-A'raf, 7:104)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Revelation at Mount Sinai and the Incident of the Golden Calf</h2>\r\n    <p>After the Exodus, Musa and Harun led the Israelites to Mount Sinai, where Allah revealed the Torah to Musa. Harun played a significant role in supporting Musa during this pivotal event. However, while Musa was on the mountain for forty days and nights, the Israelites, led astray by a man named Samiri, fell into the grave sin of idol worship.</p>\r\n    <p>Harun was left in charge of the people during Musa’s absence. Despite his efforts to prevent them from worshiping the golden calf, which Samiri had fashioned, the people succumbed to temptation. Harun attempted to dissuade them from their sinful act but was unsuccessful in fully preventing their disobedience.</p>\r\n    <p>When Musa returned and saw the people’s deviation, he was deeply upset and confronted both the idolaters and Harun. Harun explained his efforts to prevent the idolatry and his inability to control the dissenting faction, emphasizing the challenges he faced in maintaining faith among the people.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And Harun had said to them before [Musa's return], 'O my people, you are only being tested by it, and indeed, your Lord is the Most Merciful. So follow me and obey my order.'\" <br>(Surah Ta-Ha, 20:90)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Legacy and Contributions</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Harun's legacy is profound and reflects his unwavering support for his brother Musa and his role as a prophet and leader. His contributions can be summarized as follows:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Support and Collaboration:</strong> Harun’s role as Musa’s spokesperson and supporter was crucial for the success of their mission. His ability to articulate the message and stand by Musa during their confrontation with Pharaoh demonstrates the importance of cooperation and teamwork in fulfilling divine responsibilities.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Leadership and Patience:</strong> Harun’s leadership during the Exodus and his patience in handling the disobedience of the Israelites highlight his qualities as a leader. His ability to remain steadfast and supportive in challenging circumstances is a model of resilience and commitment.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Role in the Revelation:</strong> His presence at Mount Sinai during the revelation of the Torah underscores his importance in the divine mission. His role in supporting Musa during this critical time was essential for the establishment of the divine law and covenant with the Israelites.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Lessons in Faith and Obedience:</strong> The story of Harun provides lessons on the importance of faith, obedience to Allah, and the challenges faced by prophets in guiding their people. His efforts to prevent idolatry and his role in leadership reflect the difficulties and responsibilities of prophetic missions.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Endurance and Faithfulness:</strong> Harun’s story highlights the importance of enduring faith and perseverance. His dedication to Allah’s command and his role in the divine mission serve as a testament to his devotion and unwavering commitment to the cause of righteousness.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>Prophet Harun’s life and contributions are a testament to his dedication to his mission and his supportive role alongside Prophet Musa.

He succeeded Prophet Musa (Moses) as the leader of the Israelites and played a pivotal role in guiding them into the Promised Land. Yusha’s story is marked by his unwavering faith, leadership, and the divine miracles that accompanied his mission.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Early Life and Connection with Musa</h2>\r\n    <p>Yusha was born into the tribe of Ephraim, one of the tribes of the Israelites. His early life is not extensively documented, but it is known that he was a devoted follower of Prophet Musa. Yusha’s connection with Musa began during the time of their escape from Egypt and continued through the Israelites’ journey in the desert.</p>\r\n    <p>Yusha’s most significant early role was as one of the twelve spies sent by Musa to explore the land of Canaan. The mission was to assess the land’s fertility, its inhabitants, and the challenges that lay ahead. Yusha and Caleb were the only two spies who reported positively, emphasizing that with Allah’s help, the Israelites could overcome any obstacles and take possession of the land.</p>\r\n    <p>Unfortunately, the other ten spies gave a negative report, leading to widespread fear and rebellion among the Israelites. This lack of faith resulted in Allah’s decree that the Israelites would wander in the desert for forty years as a punishment for their disobedience and lack of trust.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Leadership After Musa</h2>\r\n    <p>Upon the death of Prophet Musa, Yusha was chosen by Allah to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land. This transition of leadership was crucial, as it marked the fulfillment of the divine promise made to the ancestors of the Israelites. Yusha’s leadership was characterized by his strong faith, strategic insight, and dedication to fulfilling Allah’s commands.</p>\r\n    <p>Yusha’s leadership was not merely a continuation of Musa’s mission but a new phase that involved preparing the Israelites for the challenges of settling in a new land. He was tasked with organizing the people, planning military strategies, and ensuring that they adhered to the divine laws and guidance provided by Allah.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Conquest of Jericho</h2>\r\n    <p>One of the most notable events during Yusha’s leadership was the conquest of Jericho. The city of Jericho was known for its strong fortifications and formidable defenses. The Israelites faced a daunting challenge as they approached the city, but Allah provided them with specific instructions to achieve victory.</p>\r\n    <p>Allah commanded Yusha to have the Israelites march around the city’s walls once a day for six days. On the seventh day, they were to march around the city seven times, while the priests blew trumpets and the people shouted. This seemingly unconventional strategy was a test of their faith and obedience.</p>\r\n    <p>The Israelites followed these instructions precisely. On the seventh day, after circling the city seven times and following Allah’s command, the walls of Jericho miraculously collapsed, allowing the Israelites to enter and conquer the city. This event demonstrated the power of divine intervention and the effectiveness of following Allah’s guidance without question.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"And [the Israelites] entered the city from every gate, saying, 'Peace be upon you,' and their hearts were filled with awe and fear of Allah.\" <br>(Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:23)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Challenges During the Conquest</h2>\r\n    <p>Yusha’s leadership during the conquest of Canaan involved numerous challenges. The land was not uninhabited; it was occupied by various Canaanite tribes and city-states that resisted the Israelites' entry. Yusha had to navigate both military and political obstacles, ensuring that the Israelites could secure and settle in their new homeland.</p>\r\n    <p>One of the key challenges was maintaining the unity and morale of the Israelites. Despite the divine promises and miracles, there were instances of dissent and disobedience. Yusha’s leadership required him to address these issues while ensuring that the people remained focused on their mission and adhered to the divine commands.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Lessons and Legacy</h2>\r\n    <p>The story of Prophet Yusha offers several important lessons and insights:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Faith and Obedience:</strong> Yusha’s unwavering faith and obedience to Allah’s commands, especially during the conquest of Jericho, highlight the importance of trust in divine guidance. His leadership exemplifies how faith and adherence to divine instructions can lead to success and fulfillment of promises.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Leadership and Strategy:</strong> Yusha’s effective leadership and strategic planning during the conquest reflect the importance of strong leadership in achieving collective goals. His ability to organize and inspire the Israelites was crucial for their success in entering the Promised Land.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Divine Intervention and Miracles:</strong> The miraculous event of the fall of Jericho’s walls underscores the concept of divine intervention. It serves as a reminder that Allah’s support can come in unexpected ways and that following divine guidance with sincerity can lead to extraordinary results.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Endurance and Perseverance:</strong> The challenges faced by Yusha and the Israelites demonstrate the value of endurance and perseverance. Despite the difficulties and opposition, Yusha’s steadfastness and the Israelites’ eventual success highlight the rewards of remaining patient and committed to divine guidance.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Unity and Faithfulness:</strong> Yusha’s efforts to maintain unity among the Israelites and ensure their adherence to Allah’s commands reflect the importance of communal faith and solidarity. His leadership emphasized the need for a united and faithful community to achieve shared goals.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>Prophet Yusha’s story is a testament to his faith, leadership, and the fulfillment of Allah’s promises.

His father, Isai (Jesse), was a respected figure, but Dawud himself was initially known for his humble beginnings. As the youngest of his brothers, Dawud worked as a shepherd, tending to his family's flocks. This occupation allowed him to develop qualities such as patience, resilience, and a deep connection with nature.</p>\r\n    <p>During his time as a shepherd, Dawud was also known for his musical talent. He played the harp and sang praises to Allah, which helped him develop a strong spiritual connection. His musical ability was later recognized as a divine gift, contributing to his role as a prophet and king.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Selection as King</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Dawud's rise to prominence came during a time of significant change for the Israelites. Allah chose Dawud to replace him, signifying a new era of leadership. This transition was marked by several key events:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Defeat of Jalut (Goliath):</strong> One of the most dramatic events in Dawud's life was his confrontation with Jalut, a giant warrior who challenged the Israelites. Despite being young and inexperienced in warfare, Dawud faced Jalut with immense faith and courage. Armed with only a sling and stones, Dawud defeated Jalut, which not only demonstrated his bravery but also marked him as a chosen leader by Allah.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Acceptance as King:</strong> Following the defeat of Jalut, Dawud was accepted by the people as their new king. His leadership was characterized by a commitment to justice and divine guidance, contrasting with the shortcomings of his predecessor.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <blockquote>\"So they routed them by Allah's Leave and David killed Goliath, and Allah gave him (David) the\r\n        kingdom (after the death of Saul and Samuel) and wisdom, and taught him of that which He\r\n        willed. And if Allah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed\r\n        be full of mischief. But Allah is full of Bounty to the Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exist).\r\n        (Surah 2:251).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Prophethood and Leadership</h2>\r\n    <p>David became the most famous man among the Israelites. However, he was not inveigled by this;\r\n        he was not a prisoner of fame or leadership but a prisoner of Allah's love.\r\n        Therefore, after killing Goliath he went out into the desert in the company of nature, glorifying\r\n        Almighty Allah and contemplating His favors.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Verily, We made the mountains to glorify Our Praises with him (David) in the Ashi (after the\r\n        mid-day till sunset) and Ishraq (after the sunrise till mid-day).

We made his kingdom strong and\r\n        gave him wisdom and sound judgment in speech and decision. (Surah 38:18-20)\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        \"And to David We gave the Psalms.\" (Surah 17:55).\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <p>As a prophet and king, Dawud was entrusted with both spiritual and temporal responsibilities.

His story is marked by his prophetic mission, the trial of being swallowed by a great fish, and his ultimate success through patience and repentance. His life is a profound example of divine mercy, the power of repentance, and the importance of fulfilling one’s prophetic duties.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Early Life and Background</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Jonah (Yunus) (pbuh) also known as Dhan-Nun. About his people Almighty Allah said:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Was there any town community that believed after seeing the punishment, and its Faith at that\r\n        moment, saved it from the punishment? (the answer is none)--except the people of Jonah; when\r\n        they believed, We removed from them the torment of disgrace in the life of the present world, and\r\n        permitted them to enjoy for a while. (Surah 10:98)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>Prophet Yunus was from the lineage of Prophet Yaqub (Jacob, peace be upon him), a member of the tribe of Israel. He was born in the ancient city of Nineveh, located in the region of modern-day Iraq. Yunus was known for his deep faith and commitment to Allah from a young age. His early life was marked by his strong devotion and moral integrity, which prepared him for his future role as a prophet.</p>\r\n    <p>Allah chose Yunus to deliver His message to the people of Nineveh, a city known for its corruption and idolatry. The people of Nineveh had strayed far from the path of righteousness, engaging in sinful practices and worshiping false deities. Yunus was entrusted with the task of calling them to repentance and guiding them back to the worship of the One true God.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Prophetic Mission</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Yunus’s mission was a challenging one. He faced several significant aspects and trials during his prophetic journey:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Call to Repentance:</strong> Yunus began his mission by preaching to the people of Nineveh, urging them to abandon their sinful ways and turn to Allah. He warned them of the consequences of their actions and emphasized the importance of repentance and righteousness.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Initial Rejection and Frustration:</strong> Despite Yunus’s sincere efforts, the people of Nineveh initially rejected his message. They mocked him and continued their idolatrous practices. This rejection led Yunus to feel frustrated and despondent about the lack of response from his community.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Hasty Departure:</strong> In his frustration, Yunus decided to leave Nineveh without waiting for Allah’s command. He boarded a ship, intending to escape from his mission. This decision was driven by his sense of failure and the apparent lack of progress in his prophetic efforts.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Jonah Leaves His People</h2>\r\n    <p>Try as he might to convince them of the foolishness of idolatry and of the goodness of Allah's\r\n        laws, the ignored him. He warned them that if they kept on with their foolishness, Allah's\r\n        punishment would soon follow. Instead of fearing Allah, they told Jonah that they were not afraid\r\n        of his threats. \"Let it happen,\" they told him. Jonah was disheartened. \"in that case, I will leave\r\n        you to your misery!\" so saying, he left Nineveh, fearing that Allah's anger would soon follow.</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Remember Dhan Nun (Jonah), when he went off in anger, and imagined that We shall not\r\n        punish him (the calamities which had befallen him)! (Surah 21:87)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n    <h2>The Trial of the Great Fish</h2>\r\n    <blockquote>\" And, verily, Jonah was one of the Messengers. When he ran to the laden ship, he agreed to cast\r\n        lots and he was among the losers, Then a big fish swallowed him and he had done an act worthy\r\n        of blame. Had he not been of them who glorify Allah, he would have indeed remained inside its\r\n        belly (the fish) till the Day of Resurrection. But We cast him forth on the naked shore while he\r\n        was sick and We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him. And We sent him to a hundred\r\n        thousand people or even more, and they believed; so We gave them enjoyment for a while. (Surah\r\n        37:139-148).</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The most dramatic episode in Yunus’s story involves his encounter with a great fish or whale:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Storm and Overboard:</strong> While on the ship, Yunus and the crew faced a severe storm. The crew believed that the storm was a sign of divine displeasure and that one of them was responsible. Yunus realized that his departure from his mission was the cause of the turmoil and willingly offered himself to be thrown into the sea to save the others.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Swallowed by the Fish:</strong> After being thrown into the sea, Yunus was swallowed by a great fish. He spent three days and three nights in the belly of the fish, a period of intense trial and reflection. The confinement in the fish’s belly symbolized his isolation from the world and his complete dependence on Allah.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Repentance and Supplication:</strong> In the belly of the fish, Yunus sincerely repented for his hasty departure and the shortcomings in fulfilling his mission. He prayed earnestly to Allah, reciting the heartfelt supplication from the Quran: “There is no deity except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers.” (Quran 21:87). This prayer is a powerful expression of humility and repentance.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Divine Mercy and Release:</strong> Allah, in His infinite mercy, accepted Yunus’s repentance. He commanded the fish to release Yunus onto the shore. This event marked a new beginning for Yunus, filled with renewed faith and understanding of his mission.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Allah Forgives Jonah</h2>\r\n    <p>Allah Almighty saw the sincere repentance of Jonah and heard his invocation in the whale's\r\n        stomach. Allah commanded the whale to surface and eject Jonah onto an island. The whale\r\n        obeyed and swam to the farthest side of the ocean. Allah commanded it to rise towards the warm,\r\n        refreshing sun and the pleasant earth.\r\n        The whale ejected Jonah onto a remote island. His body was inflamed because of the acids inside\r\n        the whale's stomach. He was ill, and when the sun rose, its ray burned his inflamed body so that he\r\n        was on the verge of screaming for the pain. However, he endured the pain and continued to\r\n        repeat his invocation to Allah.\r\n        Almighty Allah caused a vine to grow to considerable length over him for protection. Then Allah\r\n        Exalted caused Jonah to recover and forgave him. Allah told Jonah that if it had not been for his\r\n        praying to Him, he would have stayed in the whale's stomach till the Day of Judgment.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Return to Nineveh and Mission Success</h2>\r\n    <p>After being released from the fish, Prophet Yunus returned to Nineveh with a renewed commitment to his mission:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Reception and Repentance of the People:</strong> Upon his return, Yunus found that the people of Nineveh had undergone a significant change. They had repented sincerely for their previous sins and embraced the message of monotheism. Their genuine repentance and turn to Allah led to the lifting of the divine punishment that had been decreed for them.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Reflection and Success:</strong> Yunus’s return and the successful repentance of the people of Nineveh reflect the themes of divine mercy and the power of sincere repentance. Yunus’s story serves as a reminder of the transformative effect of Allah’s guidance and the importance of patience and trust in Allah’s plan.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <p>Ibn Abbas narrated: \"The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: 'One should not say I am better than\r\n        Jonah Ibn Matta.'\" (Sahih Bukhari).</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Lessons and Legacy</h2>\r\n    <p>The story of Prophet Yunus offers several profound lessons and reflections for believers:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>The Importance of Patience:</strong> Yunus’s initial frustration and hasty departure highlight the challenges prophets face in their missions. His eventual return and success demonstrate the importance of patience and perseverance in the face of difficulties.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>The Power of Repentance:</strong> Yunus’s sincere repentance in the belly of the fish underscores the power of asking for forgiveness. It shows that Allah’s mercy is always accessible to those who genuinely seek it, no matter the circumstances.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Divine Mercy and Forgiveness:</strong> The story highlights Allah’s boundless mercy and forgiveness. The people of Nineveh’s repentance and Yunus’s release from the fish illustrate that Allah’s mercy encompasses all and can lead to redemption and success.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Adherence to Prophetic Duties:</strong> Yunus’s experience teaches the importance of fulfilling one’s prophetic duties and the consequences of neglecting them. It underscores the need for prophets and believers alike to adhere to divine guidance and trust in Allah’s wisdom.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Role of Prophets in Guiding Communities:</strong> The life of Yunus emphasizes the critical role of prophets in guiding their communities towards righteousness. It showcases the challenges they face and the impact of their efforts in leading people to the truth.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Trust in Allah’s Plan:</strong> Yunus’s story reflects the importance of trusting in Allah’s plan and timing.

He was from the tribe of Banu Isra'il and lived during a time when the people were in need of righteous guidance. Zakariya was a man of deep faith and integrity, known for his dedication to worship and his commitment to upholding the teachings of Allah.</p>\r\n    <p>Zakariya was a priest and a prophet, holding a respected position within his community. His life was marked by his devotion to Allah and his commitment to guiding the people in their worship and moral conduct. He was also known for his role as a caretaker of the sacred temple and for his deep spiritual insight.</p>\r\n    <p>The years had taken their toll on the Prophet Zakariyah (pbuh). He was now old and bent with\r\n        age, in his nineties. Despite his feebleness, he went to the temple daily to deliver his sermons.\r\n        Zakariyah was not a rich man, but he was always ready to help those in need. His one\r\n        disappointment in life was that he had no children, for his wife was barren. This worried him, for\r\n        he feared there was no one after him to carry out his work. The people needed a strong leader, for\r\n        it they were left on their own, they would move away from Allah's teachings and change the Holy\r\n        Laws to suit themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Marriage and Desire for a Child</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Zakariya and his wife were both advanced in age and had been unable to have children throughout their lives.

His wish for a child was rooted in his faith and his hope for a successor who would carry forward the message of righteousness.</p>\r\n    <p>Zakariya’s prayers were not just personal; they were deeply intertwined with his prophetic responsibilities. He prayed to Allah to grant him a son who would be righteous and devoted, understanding that a child in such a position would help preserve the divine message and lead the community in the right direction.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Divine Response and the Birth of Yahya</h2>\r\n    <blockquote>'Kaf, Ha, Ya, Ain, Sad, (These letters are one of the miracles of the Quran, and none but Allah\r\n        Alone knows their meanings). This is a mention of the Mercy of your Lord to His slave\r\n        Zakariyah. When he called out his Lord (Allah) - a call in secret, saying: \"My Lord! Indeed my\r\n        bones have grown feeble, and gray hair has spread on my head, and I have never been unblest in\r\n        my invocation to You, O my Lord! And Verily! I fear my relatives after me, since my wife is\r\n        barren. So give me from Yourself an heir, - who shall inherit me, and inherit also the posterity of\r\n        Jacob (inheritance of the religious knowledge and Prophethood, not the wealth, etc.) And make\r\n        him, my Lord, one with whom You are Well-pleased!\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Allah said: \"O Zakariyah! Verily, We give you the glad tidings of a son. His name will be Yahya\r\n        (John). We have given that name to none before him.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        He said: \"My Lord! How can I have a son, when my wife is barren, and I have reached the\r\n        extreme old age.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        He said: \"So (it will be). Your Lord says, It is easy for Me. Certainly I have created you before,\r\n        when you had been nothing.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Zakariyah said: \"My Lord! Appoint for me a sign.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        He said: \"Your sign is that you shall not speak unto mankind for three nights, though having no\r\n        bodily defect.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Then he came out to his people from Al Mihrab (a praying place or a private room, etc.), he told\r\n        them by signs to glorify Allah's Praises in the morning and in the afternoon.\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        It was said to his son: \"O John! Hold fast to the Scripture (The Torah).\" And We gave him\r\n        wisdom while yet a child, and made him sympathetic to men as a mercy or a grant from Us, and\r\n        pure from sins (John) and he was righteous, and dutiful towards his parents, and he was neither\r\n        an arrogant nor disobedient (to Allah or to his parents). And Salamun (peace) on him the day he\r\n        was born, the day he dies, and the day he will be raised up to life again!

You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation.\"\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Then the angels called him, while he was standing in prayer in Al- Mihrab ( a praying place or a\r\n        private room), saying: \"Allah gives you glad tidings of John confirming (believing in) the Word\r\n        from Allah (\"Be!\" - and he was!

And\r\n        remember your Lord much (by praising Him again and again), and glorify Him in the afternoon\r\n        and in the morning.\" (Surah 3:38-41).</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n    <p>Allah’s response to Zakariya’s prayers was both miraculous and profound:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Announcement of Yahya’s Birth:</strong> The angel Gabriel (Jibril) visited Zakariya while he was in the temple and announced the forthcoming birth of a son named Yahya (John). This announcement was remarkable because Zakariya and his wife were past the age of childbearing, making the news a divine miracle. The angel conveyed that Yahya would be a noble and righteous prophet who would uphold the faith and lead the people with justice.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Sign of Zakariya’s Muteness:</strong> To confirm the truth of this divine promise, the angel gave Zakariya a sign: he would remain mute for three days and nights, unable to speak except through gestures. This sign was meant to reinforce Zakariya’s faith and to reflect the miraculous nature of the birth of Yahya. The period of muteness allowed Zakariya time for reflection and contemplation of Allah’s power.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Birth of Yahya:</strong> The prophecy came to pass, and Zakariya’s wife gave birth to a son, Yahya. The birth of Yahya was a cause of immense joy and gratitude for Zakariya. It was a testament to Allah’s ability to bring about miracles and fulfill promises in ways that surpass human understanding. Yahya grew up to be a prophet known for his righteousness, devotion, and his role in preparing the way for Prophet Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him).</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Role as the Guardian of Maryam</h2>\r\n    <p>In addition to his personal life, Prophet Zakariya played a crucial role as the guardian of Maryam (Mary, peace be upon her), the mother of Prophet Isa. His responsibilities in this regard were significant:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Caretaker of Maryam:</strong> Zakariya was entrusted with the care of Maryam after her mother’s vow to dedicate her to Allah’s service. Maryam was a remarkable young woman who spent much of her time in worship and devotion. Zakariya took on the responsibility of providing for her needs, ensuring her safety, and facilitating her spiritual growth.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Miraculous Provisions:</strong> Allah blessed Maryam with miraculous provisions. Zakariya observed that Maryam had access to fruits and sustenance out of season, which was a sign of her special status and Allah’s favor. This miraculous provision served as a testament to Maryam’s purity and the divine support she received in her dedication to worship.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Spiritual Guidance:</strong> As her guardian, Zakariya provided spiritual guidance and support to Maryam. He ensured that she was well-protected and that her religious and spiritual needs were met. His role was instrumental in fostering an environment of piety and devotion for Maryam.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Lessons and Legacy</h2>\r\n    <p>The story of Prophet Zakariya offers several profound lessons and insights:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>The Power of Sincere Prayer:</strong> Zakariya’s unwavering faith and sincere prayers for a child, despite his old age, illustrate the power of earnest supplication.

Known as Jesus in Christianity, he is a central figure whose life, teachings, and miraculous events hold profound importance in Islamic belief. His story is a testament to divine intervention, prophecy, and the fulfillment of God's promises.</p>\r\n    <p>In many verses of the Glorious Qur'an Allah the Exalted denied the claim of the Christians that He\r\n        has a son.</p>\r\n    <p>A delegation from Nagran came to the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). They began to talk about\r\n        their claim about the Trinity, which is that Allah is three in one, the Father, the Son, and the Holy\r\n        Spirit, with some disagreement among their sects. That is why Allah affirmed in many verses of\r\n        the Qur'an that Jesus is a slave of Allah, whom He molded in the womb of his mother like any\r\n        other of His creatures, and that He created him without a father, as He created Adam without a\r\n        father or a mother. Almighty Allah had chosen Isa to be one of his messengers to humanity.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Birth and Early Life</h2>\r\n    <p>The story of Prophet Isa's birth is a miraculous event in Islamic tradition, reflecting divine intervention and fulfilling the prophecy of a great leader to come:</p>\r\n    <p>Allah the Almighty said:</p>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Allah chose Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham and the family of Imran above the Alamin\r\n        (mankind and jinns)(of their times). Offspring, one of theo other, and Allah is All-Hearer,\r\n        All-Knower.\r\n        Remember when the wife of Imran said: \"O my Lord! I have vowed to You what (the child that) is\r\n        in my womb to be dedicated for Your services (free from all worldly work; to serve Your Place of\r\n        worship), so accept this, from me. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All Knowing.\"\r\n        Then when she delivered her (child Mary), she said: \"O my Lord! I have delivered a female\r\n        child,\" and Allah knew better what she delivered, - \"and the male is not like the female, and I\r\n        have named her Mary, and I seek refuge with You (Allah) for her and for her offspring from\r\n        Satan, the outcast.\"</blockquote>\r\n    <p>The angel's visit caused Mary great anxiety, which increased as the months went by. How could\r\n        she face giving birth to a child without having a husband? Later, she felt life kicking inside her.\r\n        With a heavy heart, she left the temple and went to Nazareth, the city in which she had been born\r\n        where she settled in a simple farm house to avoid the public.\r\n        But fear and anxiety did not leave her. She was from a noble and pious family. Her father had not\r\n        been an evil man nor was her mother an impure woman. How could she prevent tongues from\r\n        wagging about her honor?</p>\r\n    <p>Suddenly, she heard a voice nearby: \"Grieve not, your Lord has placed a rivulet below, and shake\r\n        the trunk of this tree, from which ripe dates will fall. So eat and drink and regain the strength you\r\n        have lost; and be of good cheer, for what you see is the power of Allah, Who made the dry palm\r\n        tree regain life, in order to provide food for you.\" For a while she was comforted by Allah's\r\n        miracle, for it was a sure sign of her innocence and purity.</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Miraculous Conception:</strong> Isa was born to Maryam (Mary, peace be upon her) without a father. This miraculous conception occurred by the will of Allah, as Gabriel (Jibril) announced to Maryam that she would give birth to a holy son. This event is a significant sign of Allah’s power and the special status of Isa.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Prophetic Declaration:</strong> According to Islamic tradition, even as an infant in the cradle, Isa spoke to defend his mother’s chastity and announce his role as a servant of Allah. This miraculous speech was a precursor to his future prophethood and a clear sign of his divine mission.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Early Life and Education:</strong> Isa grew up under the care of his mother, Maryam, in a humble and devout environment. His upbringing was marked by a strong spiritual foundation.

(It is) a statement of truth, about which they doubt (or dispute). It\r\n        befits not (the Majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son (this refers to the slander of\r\n        Christians against Allah, by saying that Jesus is the son of Allah). Glorified (and Exalted be He\r\n        above all that they associate with Him). When He decrees a thing, He only says to it, \"Be!\" - and\r\n        it is.\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Jesus said: \"And verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord.

But the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers) today are\r\n        in plain error. And warn them (O Muhammad) of the Day of grief and regrets, when the case has\r\n        been decided, while now they are in a state of carelessness and they believe not. (Surah 19:34-39)</blockquote>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Proclamation of the Injeel:</strong> Isa was sent with the Injeel to guide the Children of Israel.

He urged people to purify their hearts, practice justice, and follow Allah’s commandments.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Challenges and Opposition:</strong> Isa faced significant opposition from religious leaders and political authorities who were threatened by his message. His teachings challenged established norms and confronted hypocrisy and corruption.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Remember when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): \"O Jesus, son of Mary!

He is the Seal of the Prophets, and his message is considered the culmination and perfection of the divine guidance given to humanity throughout history.</p>\r\n\r\n    <h4>Description of Muhammad (peace be upon him)</h4>\r\n    <p>Muhammad (pbuh) was born in Mecca ( Makkah), Arabia, on Monday, 12 Rabi' Al-Awal (2\r\n        August A.D. 570). His mother, Aminah, was the daughter of Wahb Ibn Abdu Manaf of the\r\n        Zahrah family. His father, 'Abdullah, was the son of Abdul Muttalib. His genealogy has been\r\n        traced to the noble house of Ishmael, the son of Prophet Abraham in about the fortieth descend.\r\n        Muhammad's (peace be upon him) father died before his birth.\r\n        Before he was six years old his mother died, and the doubly orphaned Muhammad (peace be upon him) was put under\r\n        the charge of his grandfather Abdul Muttalib who took the most tender care of him. But the old\r\n        chief died two years afterwards. On his deathbed he confided to his son Abu Talib the charge of\r\n        the little orphan.</p>\r\n    <p>When Muhammad (peace be upon him) was twelve years old, he accompanied his uncle Abu Talib on a mercantile\r\n        journey to Syria, and they proceeded as far as Busra. The journey lasted for some months. It was\r\n        at Busra that the Christian monk Bahira met Muhammad (peace be upon him). He is related to have said to Abu Talib:\r\n        'Return with this boy and guard him against the hatred of the Jews, for a great career awaits your\r\n        nephew.\"</p>\r\n    <p>After this journey, the youth of Muhammad (peace be upon him) seems to have been passed uneventfully, but all\r\n        authorities agree in ascribing to him such correctness of manners and purity of morals as were\r\n        rare among the people of Mecca. The fair character and the honorable bearing of the unobtrusive\r\n        youth won the approbation of the citizens of Mecca, and by common consent he received the title\r\n        of \"Al Ameen,\" The Faithful.\r\n        In his early years, Muhammad (peace be upon him) was not free from the cares of life. He had to watch the flocks of\r\n        his uncle, who, like the rest of the Bani Hashim, had lost the greater part of his wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n    <h2>Early Life</h2>\r\n    <p>From youth to manhood he led an almost solitary life. The lawlessness rife among the Meccans,\r\n        the sudden outbursts of causeless and bloody quarrels among the tribes frequenting the Fair of\r\n        Okadh (The Arabian Olympia), and the immorality and skepticism of the Quraish, naturally caused\r\n        feelings of pity and sorrow in the heart of the sensitive youth. Such scenes of social misery and\r\n        religious degradation were characteristic of a depraved age.</p>\r\n    <p>The early life of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is marked by several key events and qualities:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Birth and Lineage:</strong> Muhammad (peace be upon him) was born in 570 CE in Mecca, a key city in the Arabian Peninsula. He was a member of the Quraysh tribe, a respected and influential tribe in Meccan society. His lineage is traced back to Ibrahim (Abraham) through his son Isma'il (Ishmael). His father, Abdullah, was deceased before his birth, and his mother, Amina, passed away when he was just six years old.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Orphanhood and Upbringing:</strong> After the death of his mother, Muhammad (peace be upon him) was cared for by his grandfather, Abdul Muttalib, and later by his uncle, Abu Talib. Despite his early losses, he grew up to exhibit exemplary character traits, including honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness. He earned the nickname \"Al-Amin\" (the Trustworthy) due to his honest nature.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Adolescence and Early Adulthood:</strong> When Muhammad (peace be upon him) was twenty five years old, he traveled once more to Syria as a factor of a noble\r\n            and rich Quraishi widow named Khadijah; and, having proved himself faithful in the commercial\r\n            interests of that lady, he was soon rewarded with her hand in marriage. This marriage proved\r\n            fortunate and singularly happy. Khadijah was much the senior of her husband, but in spite of the\r\n            disparity of age between them, the most tender devotion on both sides existed. This marriage gave\r\n            him the loving heart of a woman who was ever ready to console him in his despair and to keep\r\n            alive within him the feeble, flickering flame of hope when no man believed in him and the world\r\n            appeared gloomy in his eyes.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Prophethood and Revelation</h2>\r\n    <p>Until he reached thirty years of age, Muhammad (peace be upon him) was almost a stranger to the outside world. Since\r\n        the death of his grandfather, authority in Mecca was divided among the ten senators who\r\n        constituted the governing body of the Arabian Commonwealth. There was no such accord among\r\n        them as to ensure the safety of individual rights and property. Though family relations afforded\r\n        some degree of protection to citizens, yet strangers were frequently exposed to persecution and\r\n        oppression. In many cases they were robbed, not only of their goods, but even of their wives and\r\n        daughters. At the instigation of the faithful Muhammad (peace be upon him), an old league called the Federation of\r\n        Fudul, i.e., favors was revived with the object of repressing lawlessness and defending every weak\r\n        individual - whether Meccan or stranger, free or slave - against any wrong or oppression to which\r\n        he might be the victim within the territories of Mecca.</p>\r\n    <p>When Muhammad (peace be upon him) reached thirty-five years, he settled by his judgment a grave dispute, which\r\n        threatened to plunge the whole of Arabia into a fresh series of her oft-recurring wars. In\r\n        rebuilding the Sacred House of the Ka'ba in A.D. 605, the question arose as to who should have\r\n        the honor of raising the black stone, the most holy relic of that House, into its proper place. Each\r\n        tribe claimed that honor. The senior citizen advised the disputants to accept for their arbitrator the\r\n        first man to enter from a certain gate. The proposal was agreed upon, and the first man who\r\n        entered the gate was Muhammad (peace be upon him) \"Al-Ameen.\" His advice satisfied all the contending parties. He\r\n        ordered the stone to be placed on a piece of cloth and each tribe to share the honor of lifting it up\r\n        by taking hold of a part of the cloth. The stone was thus deposited in its place, and the rebuilding\r\n        of the House was completed without further interruption.</p>\r\n    <p>These are nearly all the public acts related by historians in which Muhammad (peace be upon him) took part in the first\r\n        fifteen years of his marriage to Khadijah. As for his private life he is described to have been ever\r\n        helpful to the needy and the helpless. His uncle Abu Talib had fallen into distress through his\r\n        endeavors to maintain the old position of his family. Muhammad (peace be upon him), being rather rich at this time by\r\n        his alliance with Khadijah, tried to discharge part of the debt of gratitude and obligation which he\r\n        owed to his uncle by undertaking the bringing up and education of his son 'Ali. A year later he\r\n        adopted 'Akil, another of his uncle's sons.</p>\r\n    <p>Khadijah bore Muhammad (peace be upon him) three sons and four daughters. All the males died in childhood, but in\r\n        loving 'Ali he found much consolation.\r\n        About this time, Muhammad (peace be upon him) set a good example of kindness, which created a salutary effect upon\r\n        his people. His wife Khadijah had made him a present of young slave named Zaid Ibn Haritha,\r\n        who had been brought as a captive to Mecca and sold to Khadijah. When Haritha heard that\r\n        Muhammad (peace be upon him) possessed Zaid, he came to Mecca and offered a large sum for his ransom.\r\n        Whereupon Muhammd (peace be upon him) said: \"Let Zaid come here, and if he chooses to go with you, take him\r\n        without ransom; but if it be his choice to stay with me, why should I not keep him?' Zaid, being\r\n        brought into Muhammad's (peace be upon him) presence, declared that he would stay with his master, who treated him\r\n        as if he was his only son. Muhammad (peace be upon him) no sooner heard this than he took Zaid by the hand and led\r\n        him to the black stone of Ka'ba, where he publicly adopted him as his son, to which the father\r\n        acquiesced and returned home well satisfied. Henceforward Zaid was called the son of\r\n        Muhammad (peace be upon him).</p>\r\n    <p>Muhammd (peace be upon him) was now approaching his fortieth year, and his mind was ever-engaged in profound\r\n        contemplation and reflection. Before him lay his country, bleeding and torn by fratricidal wars and\r\n        intolerable dissension's; his people, sunk in barbarism, addicted to the observation of rites and\r\n        superstitions, were, with all their desert virtues, lawless and cruel. His two visits to Syria had\r\n        opened to him a scene of unutterable moral and social desolation, rival creeds and sects tearing\r\n        each other to pieces, carrying their hatred to the valleys and deserts of Hijaz, and rending the\r\n        townships of Arabia with their quarrels and bitterness.</p>\r\n    <p>For years after his marriage, Muhammad (peace be upon him) had been accustomed to secluding himself in a cave in\r\n        Mount Hira, a few miles from Mecca. To this cave he used to go for prayer and meditation,\r\n        sometimes alone and sometime with his family. There, he often spent the whole nights in deep\r\n        thought and profound communion with the Unseen yet All-Knowing Allah of the Universe. It was\r\n        during one of those retirements and in the still hours of the night, when no human sympathy was\r\n        near, that an angel came to him to tell him that he was the Messenger of Allah sent to reclaim a\r\n        fallen people to the knowledge and service of their Lord.\r\n        Renowned compilers of authentic traditions of Islam agree on the following account of the first\r\n        revelations received by the Prophet.\r\n        Muhammad (peace be upon him) would seclude himself in the cave of Mount Hira and worship three days and nights.\r\n        He would, whenever he wished, return to his family at Mecca and then go back again, taking\r\n        wihim the necessities of life. Thus he continued to return to Khadijah from time to time until one\r\n        day the revelation came down to him and the Angel Gabriel (Jibreel) appeared to him and said:</p>\r\n    <p>\"Read!\"</p>\r\n    <p>But as Muhammad (peace be upon him) was illiterate, having never received any instruction in reading or writing, he\r\n        said to the angel:</p>\r\n    <p>\"I am not a reader.\"</p>\r\n    <p>The angel took a hold of him and squeezed him as much as he could bear, and then said again:</p>\r\n    <P>\"Read!\"</P>\r\n    <P>Then Prophet said:</P>\r\n    <P>\"I am not a reader.\"</P>\r\n    <P>The Angel again seized the Prophet and squeezed him and said:</P>\r\n    <blockquote>\"Read! In the Name of Your Lord, Who has created (all that exists), has created a man from a\r\n        clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood). Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous, Who has\r\n        taught (the writing) by the pen, has taught man that which he knew not.\" (Surah 96:1-4).</blockquote>\r\n    <P>Then the Prophet repeated the words with a trembling heart. He returned to Khadijah from Mount\r\n        Hira and said: \"Wrap me up! Wrap me up!\" She wrapped him in a garment until his fear was\r\n        dispelled. He told Khadijah what had occurred and that he was becoming either a soothsayer or\r\n        one smitten with madness. She replied: \"Allah forbid! He will surely not let such a thing happen,\r\n        for you speak the truth, you are faithful in trust, you bear the afflictions of the people, you spend\r\n        in good works what you gain in trade, you are hospitable and you assist your fellow men. Have\r\n        you seen anything terrible?\" Muhammad (peace be upon him) replied: \"Yes,\" and told her what he had seen.\r\n        Whereupon, Khadijah said: \"Rejoice, O dear husband and be cheerful. He is Whose hands stands\r\n        Khadijah's life bears witness to the truth of this fact, that you will be the prophet to this people.\"</P>\r\n    <P>After this experience Khadijah went to her cousin Waraqa Ibn Naufal, who was old and blind and\r\n        who knew the Scriptures of the Jews and Christians, and is stated to have translated them into\r\n        Arabic. When she told him of what she had heard, he cried out: \"Holy! Holy! Verily, this is the\r\n        Namus (The Holy Spirit) who came to Moses. He will be the prophet of his people. Tell him this\r\n        and bid him to be brave at heart.\" When the two men met subsequently in the street, the blind old\r\n        student of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures spoke of his faith and trust: \"I swear by Him in\r\n        Who hand Waraqa's life is, Allah has chosen you to be the prophet of this people. They will call\r\n        you a liar, they will persecute you, they will banish you, and they will fight against you. Oh, that I\r\n        could live to those days. I would fight for these.\" And he kissed him on the forehead.</P>\r\n    <P>The angel spoke to the grieved heart of hope and trust and of the bright future when he would see\r\n        the people of the earth crowding into the one true faith. His destiny was unfolded to him, when,\r\n        wrapped in profound meditation, melancholy and sad, he felt himself called by a voice from\r\n        heaven to arise and preach.</P>\r\n    <blockquote>\"O you (Muhammad) enveloped (in garments)! Arise and warn! And your Lord (Allah)\r\n        magnify!\" (Surah 74:1-3)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>He arose and engaged himself in the work to which he was called. Khadijah was the first to accept\r\n        his mission. She was to believe in the revelations, to abandon the idolatry of her people and to join\r\n        him in purity of heart and in offering up prayers to Allah the Almighty.</p>\r\n    <p>Prophet Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) prophethood began with a profound and transformative event:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>The Revelation:</strong> At the age of 40, while meditating in the Cave of Hira on Mount Jabal al-Nour, Muhammad (peace be upon him) received the first revelation from Allah through the angel Gabriel (Jibril). This moment marked the beginning of his prophethood and the revelation of the Quran. The initial verses revealed were from Surah Al-'Alaq (96:1-5), which commanded him to \"Read in the name of your Lord who created.\"</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Early Revelations and Message:</strong> The revelations continued over 23 years, providing guidance on all aspects of life. The central message was monotheism (Tawhid), the oneness of Allah, and the need to live a righteous life. Muhammad (peace be upon him) was tasked with preaching this message to the people of Mecca and beyond.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Early Followers:</strong> The first followers included close family members and friends, such as his wife Khadijah, his cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib, his close friend Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, and later Umar ibn al-Khattab. These early Muslims supported him through the challenges and opposition he faced.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Opposition and Persecution:</strong> Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) message faced severe opposition from the Quraysh leaders, who were threatened by his call to abandon idolatry and embrace monotheism. The early Muslims were subjected to various forms of persecution, including social ostracism, economic boycotts, and physical abuse.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Migration to Medina and Establishment of the Muslim Community</h2>\r\n    <p>The migration to Medina was a pivotal event in the establishment of the Muslim community:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>The Hijra (Migration):</strong> In 622 CE, due to escalating hostility and threats in Mecca, Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his followers migrated to Yathrib, later renamed Medina. This migration, known as the Hijra, is a significant event in Islamic history and marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Constitution of Medina:</strong> Upon arriving in Medina, Muhammad (peace be upon him) established a social and political framework that included the Constitution of Medina. This document outlined the rights and responsibilities of all residents, including Muslims, Jews, and other tribes, fostering a cooperative and peaceful society.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Building the Muslim Ummah:</strong> Muhammad (peace be upon him) worked to consolidate the Muslim community, resolve internal disputes, and establish alliances with various tribes. The early years in Medina were marked by significant events, including the Battle of Badr, where the Muslims achieved a decisive victory over the Meccans, and the Battle of Uhud, which tested the resilience of the Muslim community.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Treaty of Hudaybiyyah:</strong> In 628 CE, Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Quraysh negotiated the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, which was a peace treaty allowing Muslims to perform pilgrimage and establishing a truce between the two parties. Although initially perceived as unfavorable to Muslims, it ultimately facilitated the spread of Islam.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Conquest of Mecca:</strong> In 630 CE, Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his followers marched into Mecca and achieved a peaceful conquest. The Kaaba, which had been a center of idol worship, was cleansed of idols, and the city was dedicated to the worship of Allah alone. This event marked a significant triumph for Islam and solidified its position in the Arabian Peninsula.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Teachings and Legacy</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) teachings and actions form the cornerstone of Islamic practice and belief:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Core Teachings:</strong> The Quran, the holy book revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him), contains guidance on all aspects of life, including worship, ethics, social justice, and personal conduct. The Hadith, which are the sayings and actions of the Prophet, complement the Quran and provide practical examples of its teachings.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Sunnah (Traditions):</strong> The Sunnah refers to the practices and traditions established by Muhammad (peace be upon him). These include daily rituals, moral conduct, and social interactions. The Sunnah serves as a model for Muslims to emulate and is essential for understanding and applying the teachings of the Quran.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Farewell Pilgrimage and Sermon:</strong> During his final pilgrimage in 632 CE, known as the Farewell Pilgrimage, Muhammad (peace be upon him) delivered a profound sermon emphasizing the core principles of Islam, including equality, justice, and the rights of individuals. This sermon is known as the Farewell Sermon and is a key reference for Islamic ethics and legal principles.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Impact and Influence:</strong> Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) teachings have had a profound impact on Islamic civilization, shaping its religious, cultural, and social structures. His life and message have inspired countless individuals and have been instrumental in the development of Islamic law, philosophy, and spirituality.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Death and Succession</h2>\r\n    <p>The death of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the subsequent leadership transition were crucial for the continuity of the Muslim community:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li><strong>Death:</strong> Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) passed away on June 8, 632 CE, in Medina, after a brief illness. His death marked the end of his prophetic mission and left the Muslim community to navigate the future of their faith and leadership.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Succession:</strong> Following Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) death, leadership of the Muslim community was assumed by his closest companions, known as the Rightly Guided Caliphs. The first Caliph was Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, followed by Umar ibn al-Khattab, Uthman ibn Affan, and Ali ibn Abi Talib. These leaders were instrumental in preserving and spreading the teachings of Islam.</li>\r\n        <li><strong>Expansion and Legacy:</strong> Under the leadership of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, the Muslim community expanded rapidly, establishing a vast empire and spreading Islamic teachings across new regions. The principles and practices established by Muhammad (peace be upon him) continued to shape the course of Islamic history and civilization.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n    <p>Prophet Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) life and teachings are central to the Islamic faith. His role as the final prophet, his dedication to spreading the message of monotheism, and his exemplary conduct have left an enduring legacy. His life serves as a guide and inspiration for Muslims around the world, and his teachings continue to influence religious, ethical, and social practices to this day.</p>\r\n</body>\r\n"}]
