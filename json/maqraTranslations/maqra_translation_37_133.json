And whoever God leaves to stray, you will never find for them a way"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":89,"Text":"They wish you would disbelieve as they have disbelieved, so you may all be alike. So do not take them as allies unless they emigrate in the cause of God.

And if the victim is from a people bound with you in a treaty, then blood-money must be paid to the family along with freeing a believing slave.
