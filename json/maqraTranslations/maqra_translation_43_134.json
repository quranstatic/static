It is lawful for you to eat the flesh of all beasts other than that which is hereby announced to you. Game is forbidden while you are on Pilgrimage. God decrees what He will"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Believers, do not violate the rites of God, or the sacred month, or the offerings or their ornaments, or those that repair to the Sacred House seeking their Lord‘s grace and pleasure. Once your Pilgrimage is ended, you shall be free to go hunting. Do not allow your hatred for those who would debar you from the Holy Mosque to lead you to commit aggression. Help one another in what is good and pious, and help not one another in sin and belligerence. And fear God; God is stern in retribution"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"You are forbidden carrion, blood, and the flesh of swine; also any flesh dedicated to any other than God. You are forbidden the flesh of strangled animals and of those beaten or gored to death; of those killed by a fall or mangled by beasts of prey (unless you make it clean by giving the death-stroke yourselves); also of animals sacrificed to idols. You are forbidden to settle disputes by consulting the Arrows. That is a pernicious practice. The unbelievers have this day abandoned all hope of vanquishing your religion. Have no fear of them: fear Me. This day I have perfected your religion for you and completed My favour to you. I have chosen Islām to be your religion. He that is constrained by hunger to eat of what is forbidden, not intending to commit sin, will find God forgiving and compassionate"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"They ask you what is lawful for them. Say: ‘All wholesome things are lawful for you, as well as that which you have taught the birds and beasts of prey to catch, training them as God has taught you. Eat of what they catch for you, pronouncing upon it the name of God. And fear God: swift is God‘s reckoning.‘"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"Wholesome things are this day made lawful for you. The food of those to whom the Book was given¹ is lawful for you, and yours for them. Lawful for you are the believing women and the free women from among those who were given the Book before you, provided that you give them their dowries and live in honour with them, neither committing fornication nor taking them as mistresses. He that denies the Faith shall gain nothing from his labours; and in the world to come he will surely be among the lost"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"Believers, when you rise to pray wash your faces and your hands as far as the elbow, and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankle. If you are unclean, cleanse yourselves. But if you are sick or on a journey, or if, when you have just relieved yourselves or had intercourse with women, you can find no water, take some clean sand and rub your faces and your hands with it. God does not wish to inconvenience you; but He seeks only to purify you and to perfect His favour to you, so that you may give thanks"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"Remember God‘s favour to you, and the covenant with which He bound you when you said: ‘We hear and obey.‘ Fear God; God knows your innermost thoughts"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"Believers, fulfil your duties to God and bear true witness. Do not allow your hatred for other people to turn you away from justice. Deal justly; that will bring you closer to true piety. Fear God; God is cognizant of what you do"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"God has promised those that believe and do good works forgiveness and a rich reward"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"As for those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, they are the heirs of Hell"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Believers, remember the favour which God bestowed upon you when He restrained the hands of those who sought to harm you.
