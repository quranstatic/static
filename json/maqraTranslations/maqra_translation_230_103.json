Allah determines the night and day. He knows you will not keep count of it, so He has turned towards you. Recite as much of the Qur´an as is easy for you. He knows that some of you are ill and that others are travelling in the land seeking Allah´s bounty, and that others are fighting in the Way of Allah. So recite as much of it as is easy for you. And establish salat and pay zakat and lend a generous loan to Allah. Whatever good you send ahead for yourselves you will find it with Allah as something better and as a greater reward. And seek forgiveness from Allah. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"You who are enveloped in your cloak"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Arise and warn"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Magnify your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"Purify your clothes"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"Shun all filth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"Do not give out of a desire for gain"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"Be steadfast for your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"For when the Trumpet is blown"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"that Day will be a difficult day"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"not easy for the kafirun"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Leave the person I created on his own to Me alone"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"him to whom I have given great wealth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"and sons who stay with him"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"and whose way I have smoothed"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Then he wants Me to add yet more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"No indeed!
