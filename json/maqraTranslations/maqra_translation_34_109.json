Do not come forward to (stand in) the Prayer while you are in (any sort of) state of drunkenness until you know what you are saying, nor while you are in the state of ritual impurity (requiring the total ablution) – save when you are on a journey (and then unable to bathe) – until you have bathed (done the total ablution).

May you become deaf, O shepherd!\" (while pretending to say: \"Attend to us!\") – thus making a malicious play with their tongues and seeking to revile the (True) Religion. Had they but said, \"We have heard and we obey,\" and \"Listen to us,\" and \"Favor us with your attention!\", it would indeed have been for their own good, and more upright.
