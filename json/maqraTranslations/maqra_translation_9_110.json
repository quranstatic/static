The Prophet would be a witness of your actions, and your deeds are a witness of your worth. We initially established AL-Quds as the Kiblah toward which you, Muhammad, turned in prayer distinguishing those who obey the Prophet and exposing the disobedient who turn on their heels, reversing their position. This was hard on those with the rich legacy of Ibrahim before them but they bowed to Providence as their guide. Allah was not going to annul your religious and spiritual virtues, for Allah displays kindness to those who serve Him and those who do not: His mercy is extended to all"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":144,"Text":"We have seen you, O Muhammad, turning your face skyward in expectation of something desired, hopeful of a change relative to Ibrahim, leader of mankind. Thus, We will appoint a Kiblah for you to meet your expectation. Therefore, wherever you may be, turn your face in prayer toward the Sacred Mosque, the Ka’ba at Macca. As for Ahl Al-Kitab, they know this to be the truth from Allah, their Creator, and Allah is not unaware of all they do"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":145,"Text":"If you, Muhammad, were to present Ahl Al-Kitab with signs evincing your Prophethood and Allah’s Omnipotence and Authority, they shall never follow your Kiblah nor shall you follow theirs, nor shall they follow each other’s Qiblah, and should you be tempted to follow their vain wishes given the knowledge imparted to you, then you will miss the path of righteousness and indeed be wrong"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":146,"Text":"In fact, Ahl Al-Kitab received the Scriptures from Us foretelling all present events. They know the truth of your mission very well. They know of the Quran and the Qiblah and assert their existence as much as their sons’ identity, but some of them hide the evident truth"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":147,"Text":"But the truth has proceeded to you, O Muhammad, from Allah, your Creator, therefore do not permit their false assertions to cause you doubt and anxiety"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":148,"Text":"Every one, individually or in a group, justifying faith as a conviction operative on the character and will, is distinguished by attributes characterizing him or the group with a particular aim or goal. Or with a Kiblah meeting his or their expectations and may or may not be based on spiritual apprehension of divine truths past or present. This must not be the cause inducing you people to contend against each other. The cause for which you should be ready to contend to your life's end is good will and deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety. One day, wherever you may be, shall Allah bring you all together to His venerable Majestic presence; He is indeed Qadirun over all things"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":149,"Text":"And whenever you, Muhammad, depart from a place, turn your face at prayer toward the Sacred Mosque, for it is indeed the truth proceeding from Allah, your Creator, and Allah is not unaware of all that you do"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":150,"Text":"Again, whenever you depart from a place, always turn your face at prayer toward the Sacred Mosque and wherever you people may be, inside or outside, turn your faces at prayer to ward it, so that you people do not stand at the mark of criticism by others except by the wrongful.

And do not be callous with hearts barren of faith"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":153,"Text":"O you who believe with faithful hearts: seek consolation in patience and in prayer and draw your souls close to Allah. Allah upholds the patient who endure trouble with calmness and composure, showing forbearance under provocation, bearing with others their faults and limitations and showing constancy in labour and effort"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":154,"Text":"Do not consider the martyrs in Allah’s cause to be dead. They carried truth’s banners against odds and have acquired the glorious privilege of martyrdom through resisting shedding blood with spiritual armour. Do not say, \"They are dead\", for they are alive in heaven's realm but your senses do not perceive this fact"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":155,"Text":"We will afflict you with some disagreeable events and misfortunes to test your faith’s qualities. We will make you experience fear, hunger and loss of wealth and lives, and a diminished yield in the earth’s fruits.
