Treat kindly your parents, relatives, The orphans, And those who have been left alone in the society. Take care of the needy, The disabled, Those whose hard earned income is insufficient to meet their needs, And those whose businesses have stalled, And those who have lost their jobs. You shall treat kindly your related neighbors, And unrelated neighbors, Companions by your side in public gatherings, Or public transportation. Be generous to the needy wayfarer, the homeless son of the street, and the one who reaches you in a destitute condition. Be nice to people who work under your care. Allah does not love the proud and boastful"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":37,"Text":"Those who are stingy and advise others to be stingy, and hide what Allah has given them of His Bounty, for such ungrateful disbelievers We have prepared a humiliating punishment"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":38,"Text":"They give money to charity only to show off, and do not believe in Allah and the Last Day. Such people have taken Satan, their selfish desire, as their intimate companion. What a terrible companion indeed"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":39,"Text":"What have they to fear if they believe in Allah and the Last Day and spend of what Allah has given them? Allah is ever Aware of them"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":40,"Text":"Allah wrongs not anyone even the weight of an atom; and He multiplies a good deed, and from His Own Presence grants a great reward"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":41,"Text":"How will it be with them when (on the Resurrection Day) We bring of every community a witness, their Prophet (10:47), and We bring you (O Messenger), a witness against these, of your community"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":42,"Text":"On that Day, those who denied the Truth and paid no heed to the Messenger will wish that they were level with the ground. But not a single utterance or event could they hide from Allah"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":43,"Text":"(Those who attain belief shall promptly establish the Divine System in the community, and the Masjid would assume the role of the community center. The believers will assemble in the Masjid for prayer, and to address social welfare and community action). O You who have chosen to be graced with belief! Join not the Salat congregation if your mind is beclouded for any reason, until you understand what you utter, else you might say senseless words that disturb the assembly. Physical cleanliness contributes to moral purity. So, take a bath after ceremonial impurity. If you are traveling, or are ill, or coming from the privy, and cannot find water, take a little clean sand or earth and lightly rub your faces and hands, before entering the Masjid. (This will help you prepare psychologically for the assembly (5:6)). Allah pardons and absolves your imperfections"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":44,"Text":"Have you noted those who were given a portion of the Scripture but they purchased error for petty gains.

(He shows you the Way to protect and help yourselves). As such, Allah is Sufficient as a Protecting Friend and Allah is Sufficient as a Helper"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":46,"Text":"Some of those who are Jews, distort words to give a different meaning. They say, \"We hear and disobey,\" and \"Your words are falling on deaf ears,\" and \"Be our shepherd,\" and they twist their tongues to mock the DEEN. It would have been better and more upright for them to say, \"We hear and obey,\" and \"We hear you,\" and \"Please watch over us and guide us.\" Instead, they have incurred deprivation from the Grace of Allah due to their denial of the Truth. Few of them will embrace belief"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":47,"Text":"O You unto whom the Scripture was given! Reflect and believe in what We have revealed, that confirms the truth that you already possess, lest We efface your hopes and bring them to an end. Just as We rejected those people who broke the Sabbath. (You will lose your identity by getting scattered in the earth). Allah's Command is always done"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":48,"Text":"Allah is the Sovereign in the Universe. Whoever ascribes partners to Allah, or divinity to any of His creation, has indeed invented a tremendous sin. Allah will forgive any transgression but SHIRK. Included in this category are those who worship their own desire (45:23), those who indulge in human worship and in sectarianism (30:31), (42:21), and those who follow man-made books in lieu of the Book of Allah (6:122), (6:137), and those who claim or believe in Revelation after the Qur'an, in any form, including claims of attaining Divine knowledge through mystical experience (6:62), (7:173), (7:191). And those who uphold Trinity (4:171), (5:72-73.) And those who claim that God has a son, and those who follow their religious leaders (9:31) Such people fall from the high station of humanity. Worshiping any entity other than Allah, sinks the human \"Self\" down to subhuman levels (22:31). But most of those who claim belief (and call themselves Muslims), indulge in SHIRK"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":49,"Text":"Have you seen those who claim that they have purified their souls? Purification of \"Self\" i.e. development of the personality can only be achieved according to the Laws of Allah, by service to humanity and not through rituals or mysticism (2:177), (13:17). In the Court of Allah, men and women shall find full recompense for their doings without the least injustice"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":50,"Text":"See, how the claimants to spiritual purity deceive people by inventing lies against Allah.
