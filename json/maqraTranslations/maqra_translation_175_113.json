The one heavily loaded (with sins) may ask others _ even his own closest relatives _ to help carry some of his load, but no one will assume even a tiny bit of his burden. In fact, (oh prophet), you can alert (only) those who fear their Lord and establish ´salat´ without having seen Him. Whoever strives to purify his soul, does so for his own good. Towards Allah is (your final) destination"},{"SurahNumber":35,"VerseNumber":19,"Text":"The blind and those endowed with sight are not equal"},{"SurahNumber":35,"VerseNumber":20,"Text":"Nor are the darkness and the light"},{"SurahNumber":35,"VerseNumber":21,"Text":"Nor the (cool) shade and (the sultry heat of) the sun"},{"SurahNumber":35,"VerseNumber":22,"Text":"The dead and the living are not equal.

Allah sends water down from the sky, and with it We produce fruits of various kinds and diverse colors. Even the hills display streaks of varying colors: shades of white, red and jet black"},{"SurahNumber":35,"VerseNumber":28,"Text":"Similarly men, beasts, crawling creatures and cattle are of different colors, too. Indeed, among His servants, those with knowledge are the ones who really fear Allah. Of course! Allah is the Mightiest and the most Forgiving"},{"SurahNumber":35,"VerseNumber":29,"Text":"There are those who recite the book of Allah, perform ´salat´ and (for the sake of Allah) spend _ secretly as well as openly _ out of the wealth We have given them. They do so because they expect a bargain with no risk of loss"},{"SurahNumber":35,"VerseNumber":30,"Text":"So that Allah may grant them their reward in full, and by His grace grant them even more (than their deeds deserve). Indeed, He is the most Forgiving. And He appreciates (and rewards) gratitude"},{"SurahNumber":35,"VerseNumber":31,"Text":"(Oh prophet)! The book We have revealed to you is the absolute truth. It reaffirms (the truth revealed in) the earlier scriptures. Allah is certainly well informed about His servants. He watches over them"},{"SurahNumber":35,"VerseNumber":32,"Text":"Then, We chose others among Our servants and had them inherit the (last) book. Some among them are unjust to themselves (and refuse to accept this inheritance _ the Qur´an), and some are lukewarm in their acceptance.

Our Lord is certainly the most Forgiving. He is ready to appreciate and reward gratitude (profusely)"},{"SurahNumber":35,"VerseNumber":35,"Text":"The One Who has given us, by His grace, this house of eternity to live. Here, we do not have to toil and struggle! Here, we do not undergo any fatigue"},{"SurahNumber":35,"VerseNumber":36,"Text":"There is hellfire for those who disbelieve. It will not finish them off completely. They will not die. But the torture will not be reduced (or eased).

This time around, we will perform righteous deeds, quite different from what we did earlier!\" (They shall receive the answer), \"Did We not give you a life long enough for you to listen to (and heed) the advice, if you really wanted.

There is no helper for the unjust (and the cruel)"},{"SurahNumber":35,"VerseNumber":38,"Text":"Allah is the One Who knows all the unseen mysteries of the heavens and the earth. Indeed, He even knows that which lies hidden in the hearts (of all beings)"},{"SurahNumber":35,"VerseNumber":39,"Text":"Certainly, it is He Who appointed man as His deputy on earth.

The rejection of the unbelievers, therefore, does nothing more than multiply their own loss"},{"SurahNumber":35,"VerseNumber":40,"Text":"Say, \"What do you think about the partners you call upon and pray to other than Allah? Show me what they have created on this earth! Or do you think they have any share in the heaven?\" Have We given them a book they can cite in support of their views? Not so at all! In fact what the evildoers assure each other are mere delusions"}]}
