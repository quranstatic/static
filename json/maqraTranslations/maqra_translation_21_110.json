Paradise beneath which rivers flow is unsurpassed in beauty and supreme bliss, destined to those who revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him. They will have passed through nature to Eternity companioned by mates of their design, pure and holy, fellows of their piety. Above all they come in Allah’s grace and they win His satisfaction and esteem. Allah is Vigilant. He keeps a watchful eye upon His creation and upon the way people conduct themselves in life; He knows the attributes inherent in each and all"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"He knows and spiritually sustains those whose hearts have been touched by the divine hand, who are vested with the cardinal virtues, expressing their thoughts in words to pray Allah for forgiveness.

So have those who fell into line with me.\" Say to them and to the illiterates: \"Are you now satisfied with what you heard and have your doubts been satisfied? If you are, then conform to Islam\". If they do, then they are on the path of righteousness, but should they turn a deaf ear and their hearts cannot hear the truth, you are only responsible for relating the message.
