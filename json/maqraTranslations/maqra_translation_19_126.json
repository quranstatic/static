Rather, Allah puts on the right path whom He wills. Whatever good you spend is for your own selves, and you shall not spend but to seek the pleasure of Allah, and whatever good thing you spend shall be repaid to you in full, and you shall not be wronged"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":273,"Text":"(Your charities should be preferably meant) for the needy who are confined in the way of Allah, unable to travel in the land.An ignorant person takes them as free of need because of their abstinence. You know them by their appearance (from begging). They do not beg people importunately, and whatever good thing you spend, Allah is All-Aware of it"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":274,"Text":"Those who spend their wealth night and day, secretly and openly,- they have their reward with their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":275,"Text":"Those who take ribā (usury or interest) will not stand but as stands the one whom the demon has driven crazy by his touch. That is because they have said: “Sale is but like ribā.’’, while Allah has permitted sale, and prohibited ribā. So, whoever receives an advice from his Lord and desists (from indulging in ribā), then what has passed is allowed for him, and his matter is up to Allah. As for the ones who revert back, those are the people of Fire. There they will remain forever"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":276,"Text":"Allah destroys ribā and nourishes charities, and Allah does not like any sinful disbeliever"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":277,"Text":"Surely those who believe and do good deeds, and establish Salāh (prayer) and pay Zakāh will have their reward with their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":278,"Text":"O you who believe, fear Allah and give up what still remains of ribā, if you are believers"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":279,"Text":"But if you do not (give it up), then listen to the declaration of war from Allah and His Messenger. However, If you repent, yours is your principal. Neither wrong, nor be wronged"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":280,"Text":"If there is one in misery, then (the creditor should allow) deferment till (his) ease, and that you forgo it as alms is much better for you, if you really know"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":281,"Text":"Be fearful of a day when you shall be returned to Allah, then every person shall be paid, in full, what he has earned, and they shall not be wronged"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":282,"Text":"O you who believe, when you transact a debt payable at a specified time, put it in writing, and let a scribe write it between you with fairness. A scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has educated him. He, therefore, should write. The one who owes something should get it written, but he must fear Allah, his Lord, and he should not omit anything from it.If the one who owes is feeble-minded or weak or cannot dictate himself, then his guardian should dictate with fairness. Have two witnesses from among your men, and if two men are not there, then one man and two women from those witnesses whom you like, so that if one of the two women errs, the other woman may remind her. The witnesses should not refuse when summoned. And do not be weary of writing it down, along with its due date, no matter whether the debt is small or large. That is more equitable in Allah’s sight, and more supportive as evidence, and more likely to make you free of doubt. However, if it is a spot transaction you are effecting between yourselves, there is no sin on you, should you not write it. Have witnesses when you transact a sale. Neither a scribe should be made to suffer, nor a witness. If you do (something harmful to them), it is certainly a sin on your part, and fear Allah. Allah educates you, and Allah is All-Knowing in respect of everything"}]}
