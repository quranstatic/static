Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliya' (friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), they are but Auliya' to one another. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliya', then surely he is one of them.

Then they will become regretful for what they have been keeping as a secret in themselves"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":53,"Text":"And those who believe will say: \"Are these the men (hypocrites) who swore their strongest oaths by Allah that they were with you (Muslims)?\" All that they did has been in vain (because of their hypocrisy), and they have become the losers"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"O you who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from his religion (Islam), Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers, fighting in the Way of Allah, and never afraid of the blame of the blamers.

Verily, the Revelation that has come to you from Allah increases in most of them their obstinate rebellion and disbelief. We have put enmity and hatred amongst them till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allah extinguished it; and they (ever) strive to make mischief on earth. And Allah does not like the Mufsidun (mischief-makers)"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":65,"Text":"And if only the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) had believed (in Muhammad SAW) and warded off evil (sin, ascribing partners to Allah) and had become Al-Muttaqun (the pious - see V. 2:2) We would indeed have blotted out their sins and admitted them to Gardens of pleasure (in Paradise)"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":66,"Text":"And if only they had acted according to the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), and what has (now) been sent down to them from their Lord (the Quran), they would surely have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet.
