But some of them, despite hearing and comprehending the Word of Allah (in Torah) have been distorting it knowingly"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":76,"Text":"And when they meet with those who have attained belief, say, \"We believe as you believe.\" But when they get together with one another, they say, \"Do you inform them of that which Allah has disclosed to you, so that they might use it in argument against you? And all this before your Lord! Will you then not use your intellect"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":77,"Text":"Do they not know that Allah is aware of what they conceal and what they reveal"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":78,"Text":"Among them are the illiterate who do not know their Scripture except by hearsay and, therefore, depend on conjecture"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":79,"Text":"Then, woe unto those (their scholars) who write the Scripture with their own hands and claim, \"This is from Allah.\" They traffic with it for petty gains. (They distort the Scripture tampering with its verses to suit their designs and exploit those who are illiterate). Woe unto them for what their hands do write, and for the earning they make thereby"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":80,"Text":"And, yet they say, \"The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days.\" (Because of their wishful thinking that they are the chosen ones). Say, \"Have you taken any special pledge from Allah, which of course, He never breaks, or is it that you say things about Allah contrary to the august realm of knowledge"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":81,"Text":"Nay, but whoever keeps disrupting the lives of others, and his faults upon faults surround him - such are destined for the Fire, therein to abide"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":82,"Text":"And those who choose to be graced with belief, and help others - they are destined for the Paradise, therein to abide"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":83,"Text":"(The Covenant We made with the Children of Israel was not of unconditional favors.) When We made a promise with the Children of Israel, (We said), \"Serve none save Allah, and be kind to your parents, and to relatives, and to orphans, widows, and to the needy - those left alone in the society, and those whose income has stalled for any reason. And speak to people and treat them nicely, and establish the Divine System in the society, and set up the Just Economic Order (keeping your wealth open for the benefit of all).\" Then, after that, you slid back, except a few of you, and you backslide even now"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":84,"Text":"And, We made a Covenant with you saying, \"Desist from feuds and mutual bloodshed, and do not expel your own people from your towns and dwellings. Then you agreed and you were witnesses thereof"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":85,"Text":"Yet you it is who subdue and slay your own folk, and evict a weak faction among you from their homes. And you support one another in hurting the community and sowing the seeds of discord. And when these homeless people get enslaved by others and are brought to you, you ransom them, whereas it was unlawful for you to evict them in the first place. What! Do you wish to accept one part of the Scripture and reject the other? Think then, what the reward of such wrongdoing must be, nothing but disgrace in the life of this world - and on the Day of Resurrection the most grievous chastisement! For Allah is not unaware of what you do. (The verse is referring to the Jewish community of Madinah, but as is always the case in the Qur'an, the Commands have a wide historical applicability - in this case, to oppressive societies anywhere anytime)"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":86,"Text":"Such are those who fall for instant gratification, buying the life of this world at the price of long-term gains and the Hereafter. Their punishment will not be lightened neither will they receive any help"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":87,"Text":"And, verily, We had given the Scripture to Moses and We sent other Messengers in succession after him. And We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear evidence of the Truth and We strengthened him with Sacred Revelation. Yet is it not so that Whenever a Messenger came to you with something that was not to your liking, you became stubbornly arrogant, and some of them you called impostors, and others you killed? (Also, you have attempted to strike a deal with the Messengers in order to alter the Messages (10:15), (11:113), (1)"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":88,"Text":"And they say, \"Our hearts are bags of knowledge.\" Nay, but Allah has deprived them of His Grace for their persistent rejection of the Truth. Therefore, only a few of them will choose to be graced with belief"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":89,"Text":"And when there comes to them the Book of Allah, confirming the authentic in what they have, they flatly deny it although before that they had been praying for a signal victory over those who denied all Divine Revelation. And whenever there came unto them something that they recognized as the Truth, they would deny it. Then, deprivation of Allah's grace is the lot of all those who thanklessly reject His Guidance and choose to live in darkness. ('Kufr' includes all the meanings given in the last sentence)"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":90,"Text":"Miserable indeed is for which they sell their 'Selves' - that they deny that which Allah has revealed. (Grudgingly, they cannot get over the fact that Allah has chosen a Messenger who is not an Israelite). And that Allah should reveal His bounty to whomever He chooses among His servants. And so (for their discriminatory attitude) they have invited Requital upon Requital. And for all those who thanklessly deny the Guidance and choose to live in darkness, is a logical consequence of suffering that brings them low"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":91,"Text":"And when it is said to them, \"Be graced with belief in what Allah has revealed,\" they say, \"We only accept that which has been handed over to us.\" And they deny that which comes after it, though it is the Truth confirming the authentic that is with them.
