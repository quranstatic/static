The reasonable cost of their maintenance and clothing will be the responsibility of the child’s father. No one should be charged with more than they can afford. Neither a mother should be made to suffer on account of her child nor a father on account of his child. The father’s heirs are under the same obligation. But if, with mutual agreement, they both decide to wean the child, there is no blame on them.

Fear Allah and beware that Allah observes your actions"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":234,"Text":"As for those of you who die and leave widows behind, let them abstain from marriage for four months and ten days: when they have reached the end of this period, there is no blame on you for what they do for themselves in a decent manner.
