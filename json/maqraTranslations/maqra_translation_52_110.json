If I were to disobey Him, Heaven shall lay my transgression to my charge and requite me with an immense punishment on a momentous Day"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"He who escapes censure on that Momentous Day, will have won Allah's mercy, and this is indeed triumph supreme"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":17,"Text":"If Allah afflicts you with a touch of a misfortune then no one can relieve you of it but Him. And if He should grace you with a touch of good fortune, He is Qadirun to effect all in all"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":18,"Text":"He is the Supreme controlling and influencing power inherent in all His servants and in His Created beings, and He is the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations and AL-Khabir (Cognizant of all things)"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":19,"Text":"Ask O Muhammad those who doubt your mission: \"What documentary evidence has more weight to support the truth of my mission than the attestation by Allah Himself!\" \"He is the witness of my actions and of your actions\". \"This Quran has been inspired to me to guide you into all truth and to warn you and warn all those whom it shall reach against counting Allah as being plural\". \"Do you people really bear witness to the plurality of Allah!\" \"I Just will not accord with this\".

They assert the existence of this reality as much as they are able to assert the identity of their sons, but those who are cheaply vicious to the perdition of their own souls refuse to recognize the truth"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":21,"Text":"And who is more wrongful than he who viciously and wrongfully relates to Allah falsehood or denies His revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority! Never shall the wrongful of actions find one instance of physical or spiritual prosperity Hereafter"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":22,"Text":"The Day shall come when We throng them all together and say to them: \"Where are your deities which you presumed to have divine nature that you incorporated them with Allah"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":23,"Text":"Not knowing what to do nor which way to turn they shall say: \"By Allah, our Creator, never did we incorporate with Allah other deities"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":24,"Text":"See how they will lie in their teeth and tell lies about themselves and be forsaken and renounced by those whom they presumed to share with Allah His divine nature and how they shall fail their expectations"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":25,"Text":"And among them are some who listen to your discourse on practical divinity and to the Quran when you recite it, not to profit by it but to pick holes in it and be able to tell their evil minds. The fact is that We have closed their heartsâ€™ ears and deafened their ears to reason. They just would not apprehend with their senses any revelation or any sign no matter how convincing to the mind they be. And when they come to you O Muhammad they do not humble themselves but in arrogance they are more ready to argue than to obey. Vested with infidelity, they interpret their thoughts in words: \"This is nothing\", they say, \"but fables of old"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":26,"Text":"And they incite people to reject the Quran and decline to accept it, and they themselves have nothing to do with it.

And when all of a sudden the predetermined Eventful Hour surprises them, they shall say with pining regrets and vain repentances: \"It is a great pity to have neglected our duty to Allah in life below and for what we left undone.\" They shall be burdened with wrongs more then their backs can bear. Evil indeed is the fate of those who are burdened with wrongs, and evil indeed are the wrongs they wear"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":32,"Text":"Indeed life here is but an illusive and rapid change of feeling, fancy and thought and an amusement bringing happiness to those who cannot think, whereas, the abode in heaven's realm Hereafter is far better and indeed blissful but for those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; can you people not reflect"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":33,"Text":"We do know O Muhammad that what their dishonesty admits of irreverent discourse grieves you at heart, In fact it is not you that they charge with falsehood, but it is Allah's revelations, signs and Authority that the wrongful deny.

You have already been given a narrative of the Messengers who preceded you"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":35,"Text":"If their natural aversions and antipathies perturb you, and you are able to excavate a roadway underground or set up a ladder to ascend heavenward to bring about a sign to convince them of the truth of your mission, then by all means do it. Had Allah willed He would have united their thoughts and feelings to meditate reverence and obedience to Him and seek His guidance and spiritual union. Therefore, do not be one of those destitute of Allah's knowledge"}]}
