Many of the rabbis and monks wrongfully devour mankind's possessions and hinder people from the Way of Allah. And there are those who amass gold and silver and do not spend it in the Way of Allah. Announce to them the tidings of a painful chastisement"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":35,"Text":"on a Day when they shall be heated up in the Fire of Hell, and their foreheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded with it, (and they shall be told): \"This is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves. Taste, then, the punishment for what you have hoarded"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":36,"Text":"Surely the reckoning of months, in the sight of Allah, is twelve months, laid down in Allah's decree on the day when He created the heavens and the earth; and out of these months four are sacred. That is the true ordainment. Do not, therefore, wrong yourselves, with respect to these months.

They declare a month to be lawful in one year and forbidden in another year in order that they may conform to the number of months that Allah has declared as sacred, and at the same time make lawful what Allah has forbidden. Their foul acts seem fair to them. Allah does not direct those who deny the Truth to the Right Way"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":38,"Text":"Believers!

Allah is with us.\" Then Allah caused His tranquillity to descend upon him, and supported him with hosts you did not see, He humbled the word of the unbelievers. As for Allah's Word, it is inherently uppermost. Allah is All-Powerful, All-Wise"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":41,"Text":"March forth whether light or heavy, and strive in the way of Allah with your belongings and your lives. That is best for you if you only knew it"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":42,"Text":"Were it a gain at hand or a short journey, they would have surely followed you, but the distance seemed too far to them. Still they will swear by Allah: \"If only we could, we would surely have gone forth with you.\" They merely bring ruin upon themselves. Allah knows well that they are liars"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":43,"Text":"(O Prophet), may Allah forgive you!
