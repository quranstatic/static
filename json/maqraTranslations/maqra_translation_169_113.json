If you fear Allah, do not speak in a soft and pleasant voice, lest someone harboring evil desires in his heart entertains evil thoughts. Be straightforward and say the right thing"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":33,"Text":"Stay put in your homes, and do not display your charms in the manner of the earlier days of ignorance. Establish the ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´ and obey Allah and His messenger.

Allah had done favors upon him, and you had too. You were saying to him, \"Fear Allah, keep your wife and do not divorce her.\" Allah was going to bring out into the open that which you kept hidden in your heart at that time. You were afraid of people, although that is Allah´s right! You should fear Him only! When Zayd had completed his object (of divorcing his wife), We married her to you. (We did that) so the believers may have no restriction in (and may have no stigma attached to) marrying the former wives of their adopted sons, provided the adopted sons had already divorced their wives. The commands of Allah must be fulfilled"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":38,"Text":"No restriction stands in the way of the prophet. Nothing restrains him from carrying out the orders of Allah.

We have made your wives lawful for you _ provided their agreed nuptial-dower has been paid _ and the slave women Allah has granted you. (Other women lawful for you to marry are): the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts _ those of them who migrated with you (from Makkah)_ and the believing woman who wants to enter the prophet´s household as his wife and he wants to espouse her. This (more than four wives) is an exemption especially for you, not for any other believer. We know what We have mandated for the believers concerning their wives, and the captive women. You are exempted so as to remove the difficulty you face! (The difficulty: the taboo, the culturally imposed restriction against marrying the former wives of the adopted sons, had to be broken by an actual example. It had to be done without divorcing any of the existing wives. The solution: suspend the limit of four wives for the prophet). Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful. NB: Another taboo broken by this divinely ordained marriage was the restriction against cousin marriages. The woman was the prophet´s first cousin"}]}
