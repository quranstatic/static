They change the words from their (right) times and places: they say, \"If ye are given this, take it, but if not, beware!\" If any one's trial is intended by God, thou hast no authority in the least for him against God. For such - it is not God's will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a heavy punishment"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":42,"Text":"(They are fond of) listening to falsehood, of devouring anything forbidden.

By its standard have been judged the Jews, by the prophets who bowed (as in Islam) to God's will, by the rabbis and the doctors of law: for to them was entrusted the protection of God's book, and they were witnesses thereto: therefore fear not men, but fear me, and sell not my signs for a miserable price. If any do fail to judge by (the light of) what God hath revealed, they are (no better than) Unbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":45,"Text":"We ordained therein for them: \"Life for life, eye for eye, nose or nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and wounds equal for equal.\" But if any one remits the retaliation by way of charity, it is an act of atonement for himself.

To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. If God had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but (His plan is) to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to God; i t is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":49,"Text":"And this (He commands): Judge thou between them by what God hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they beguile thee from any of that (teaching) which God hath sent down to thee.
