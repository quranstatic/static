They take the words out of context. They say, “If you are given this, take it, but if not, beware.” If for anyone a trial is intended by God, you have no authority in the least for him against God. For them, it is not God's will to redeem their hearts. For them there is disgrace in the present, and in the hereafter a heavy punishment"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":42,"Text":"They listen to falsehood, and devour things forbidden. If they do come to you, either judge between them or decline to interfere. If you decline, they cannot harm you in the least. If you judge, judge with justice between them, for God loves those who judge with justice"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":43,"Text":"But why do they come to you for decision, when they have the Torah before them? In it is the command of God, yet even after that they would turn away, because they are not people of faith"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":44,"Text":"It was We who revealed the Law containing guidance and light. By its standard, the Jews have been judged by the Prophets who bowed to God's will, by the rabbis and by the doctors of law, for to them was entrusted the protection of God's book, and they were witnesses to that. Therefore, do not fear others, but fear Me, and do not sell My signs for a miserable price. If any fail to judge by what God has revealed, they are unbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":45,"Text":"We ordained in it for them, “Life for life, eye for eye, nose for nose, ear for ear, tooth for tooth, and wounds equal to the other.” But if anyone refrains from retaliation by way of charity, it is an act of atonement for them, and if any fails to judge by what God has revealed, they are wrongdoers"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":46,"Text":"And in their footsteps, We sent Jesus the son of Mary, reflecting the truth of the Law that had come before him.

So judge between them by what God has revealed, and do not follow their vain desires, diverging from the truth that has come to you. To each one among you We have prescribed a law and a clear way. If God had so willed, He would have made you a single people, but His plan is to challenge you with what He has given you. So strive as in a race to all virtues. The goal of you all is to God. It is He Who will show you the truth of that which you dispute"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":49,"Text":"And judge between them by what God has revealed. And do not follow their selfish desires, but beware of them, so that they will not mislead you from that which God has sent down to you. And if they turn away, know that for some of their sins it is God's will to punish them. And indeed most people are rebellious"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":50,"Text":"Do they then seek a judgment of ignorance? But who, for a people whose faith is assured, can give better judgment than God"}]}
