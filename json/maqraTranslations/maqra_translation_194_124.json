What you call them to, appears a tall order to those who worship others besides Allah. Allah calls to Himself whom He wills, and guides to Himself one who turns to Him"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"And they did not break up their unity, but only after they had received knowledge — out of mutual jealousy. And had it not been for a decree already issued from your Lord for a set term, their matter would indeed have been decided then and there. And those indeed who have inherited the Book after them are in grave doubt and suspicion about it"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"To this [Qur'aan], then, you invite [all mankind], and persistently follow the course as prescribed [by Allah]. And follow not their vain desires. And say, \"I believe in whatever Writ Allah has sent down. And I am commanded to deal justly with problems amongst you.

And who knows, the Hour (the time when the present world will end and the Hereafter begin) may well be near"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":18,"Text":"Those who do not believe in it ask for hastening it. And those who believe, fear it and know it to be the truth. Beware! Those who entertain doubts about the Hour have certainly indeed gone far astray"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":19,"Text":"Allah is most kind to His subjects. He provides for them as much as He wills.

That is the greatest favour [a human being can achieve]"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":23,"Text":"That favour is what Allah gives the glad tiding of, to such of His subjects as believe and do righteous deeds.

He is indeed aware of what goes on is in the minds [of human beings]"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":25,"Text":"And it is He Who accepts repentance from His subjects, pardons bad deeds, and it is He Who knows all that you do"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":26,"Text":"And He responds to those who believe and do righteous deeds, and He gives them more out of His Grace.
