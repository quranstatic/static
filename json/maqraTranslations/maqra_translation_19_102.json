Whatever you spend you will do so for yourself, for you will do so to seek the way that leads to God; and what you spend in charity you will get back in full, and no wrong will be done to you"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":273,"Text":"(Give to) the needy who are engaged in the service of God who are not able to move about in the land, whom the ignorant consider to be affluent as they refrain from asking. You can know them from their faces for they do not ask of men importunately. God is surely cognisant of good things that you spend"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":274,"Text":"Those who spend of their wealth in the way of God, day and night, in secret or openly, have their reward with their Lord, and have nothing to fear or regret"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":275,"Text":"Those who live on usury will not rise (on Doomsday) but like a man possessed of the devil and demented. This because they say that trading is like usury. But trade has been sanctioned and usury forbidden by God. Those who are warned by their Lord and desist will keep (what they have taken of interest) already, and the matter will rest with God. But those who revert to it again are the residents of Hell where they will abide for ever"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":276,"Text":"God takes away (gain) from usury, but adds (profit) to charity; and God does not love the ungrateful and sinners"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":277,"Text":"Those who believe and do good deeds, and fulfil their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, have their reward with their Lord, and will have neither fear nor regret"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":278,"Text":"O believers, fear God and forego the interest that is owing, if you really believe"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":279,"Text":"If you do not, beware of war on the part of God and His Apostle. But if you repent, you shall keep your principal. Oppress none and no one will oppress you"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":280,"Text":"If a debtor is in want, give him time until his circumstances improve; but if you forego (the debt) as charity, that will be to your good, if you really understand"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":281,"Text":"Have fear of the day when you go back to God. Then each will be paid back in full his reward, and no one will be wronged"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":282,"Text":"O believers, when you negotiate a debt for a fixed term, draw up an agreement in writing, though better it would be to have a scribe write it faithfully down; and no scribe should refuse to write as God has taught him, and write what the borrower dictates, and have fear of God, his Lord, and not leave out a thing. If the borrower is deficient of mind or infirm, or unable to explain, let the guardian explain judiciously; and have two of your men to act as witnesses; but if two men are not available, then a man and two women you approve, so that in case one of them is confused the other may prompt her. When the witnesses are summoned they should not refuse (to come). But do not neglect to draw up a contract, big or small, with the time fixed for paying back the debt. This is more equitable in the eyes of God, and better as evidence and best for avoiding doubt. But if it is a deal about some merchandise requiring transaction face to face, there is no harm if no (contract is drawn up) in writing. Have witnesses to the deal, (and make sure) that the scribe or the witness is not harmed. If he is, it would surely be sinful on your part. And have fear of God, for God gives you knowledge, and God is aware of everything"}]}
