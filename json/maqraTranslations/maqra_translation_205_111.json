So He knew what is in their hearts, so He made to descend As-Sakinah (calmness and tranquility) over them and He rewarded them an immediate success"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":19,"Text":"As far as abundant spoils of war (are concerned) they will pick it up in future. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":20,"Text":"Allah has given you a promise regarding abundant spoils of war; you will receive it (in some coming encounter); so He has hastened for you this (immediate success) and He has restrained the hands of (the enemical) people from you (through a treaty of peace signed within the belly of Makka. See Verse No. 24). And (this He appreciated) so that it (i.e., the signing of a peace treaty to overcome adverse conditions and periods) becomes a Sign for the Believers; and in order that He may guide you to Siratam Mustaqim"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":21,"Text":"And the later one, you have definitely not made an assessment thereof, surely Allah has compassed it — and Allah is All-Capable over every thing"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":22,"Text":"And if would have fought against you those who have disbelieved they certainly would have turned (their) backs (in spite of being greater in numbers), then they will not find a wali and nor a helper"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":23,"Text":"That had been the Sunnah of Allah which definitely continued and persisted since before. And you will never find a change for the Sunnah (Practice) of Allah"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":24,"Text":"And He it is Who restrained their hands from you and (withheld) your hands from them within (the) Batn (belly) of Makka; after that He had made you dominating over them. And Allah has remained Well-Acquainted of what you do"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":25,"Text":"They happened to be those who have disbelieved and hindered you from Al-Masjid-al-Haram, and thus Al-Hadiya (the Gift of sacrificial animals) became detained — that it may reach its specified place. And had there not been Believing men and the Believing women, you people do not know them, so you will trample them; and because of them a serious deviation from the correct step inflicts you (and goes to your account as a sin) because of the absence of knowledge. (If the situation was not such, We would have allowed an armed encounter in place of a treaty of peace) — so that Allah may admit into His Mercy whom He may think proper. If (the two groups, i.e., the Believers and the disbelievers were not intermixed and had already) separated (to be recognised easily, then) surely We would have punished those who had disbelieved amongst you in the form of a painful torment (by the aided hands of the Believing army)"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":26,"Text":"When those who disbelieved had placed in their hearts the pride and haughtiness — pride and haughtiness based on ignorance, then Allah made to descend His Sakinah upon His Messenger and upon the Believers. And He kept them attached to the statement of obedience (La-ilaha-ill-Allah Muhammadun Rasulullah. See Verses 37/35, 48/29), and they were more entitled to it and worthy of it. And Allah is All-Knower of every thing"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":27,"Text":"Surely, indeed Allah has fulfilled for His Messenger the vision with full justice. Certainly, you shall enter Al-Masjid-al-Haram, if Allah thought proper, as attainers of peace, (and as) those who have submitted their heads to a clean-shave, and (as) those who (got their scalp-hair) trimmed. You will feel no fear. So He knew what you knew not, that is why He sanctioned instead of this Fathan Qariban ['an immediate success.' (This Fathan Qariban is the treaty of peace signed in the belly of Makka which makes the Believers to interrupt the programme of attending the Hajj and also stops them from offering Animal-Sacrifice at the proper place meant and specified for it)][Please note that attending to the haircut is compulsory before initiating the 2nd part of the Hajj-Congregation]"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":28,"Text":"He it is Who has sent His Messenger with Al-Hudah and the True, Legitimate, Original Religion that He may make it prevail over way of life — to each and every aspect of it, and sufficient is Allah as Witness"},{"SurahNumber":48,"VerseNumber":29,"Text":"Muhammadun Rusulullah [Muhammad (is the) Messenger of Allah], and those who are with him are extremely strict against disbelievers, (and) highly merciful and concerned among themselves. You see them bowing, and falling down in prostration (while in Prayer). They seek the Bounty from Allah and (His) Assents and Agreements. Their marks (are evident) in their facies from the effect of the submissions. This (becomes) their example in At-Taurat, and (another) example for them in Al-Injeel: like a (sown) seed which sent out its shoot, then made it firm, then it became thick, then it stood (straight and stable) on its stem. (Now) it puts the sower to wonder — that He may enrage the disbelievers because of these (happy sowers). Allah has promised those who have Believed and performed righteous deeds amongst them — forgiveness and a mighty reward"}]}
