Because of the wrong they have wrought, Allah has made them revert (to disbelief). Do you wish to guide the one whom Allah has led astray? You will not find any way out for the one whom Allah misleads"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":89,"Text":"The hypocrites wish that you would reject faith just like they have. Then, you will (descend down to their level and) be equal to them. Therefore, do not choose them as friends unless they (emigrate and) leave their homes in the path of Allah. If they revert (to open hostility), then seize and slay them wherever you see them. Do not take them as friends or protectors, nor as helpers"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":90,"Text":"Except for those (hypocrites) who find refuge with a nation with whom you have a treaty! Or unless they come to you such that their hearts cringe and neither allow them to fight you, nor their own people. Had Allah willed, He would have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. Therefore, if they stay aloof and do not fight you, or if they make overtures of peace, then Allah has given you no reason to commit aggression against them"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":91,"Text":"You will find other hypocrites who seek to stay safe from you, as well as from their people. But, (as soon) as they are tempted with a lure, they plunge headlong into mischief. If they do not stay neutral, and do not make overtures of peace towards you, and do not restrain their hands, then seize and slay them wherever you see them. In their case, We have given you a clear sanction"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":92,"Text":"It is not (conceivable) for a believer to kill another believer _ unless it was (unintended, accidental or) by mistake. Whoever kills a believer by (accident or) mistake must set free a believing slave (as a penance), and must pay blood money as compensation to the family of the deceased _ unless the family waives (the blood money) out of charity. If the deceased belonged to a nation at war with you and was also a believer, then the penance shall be the freeing of a believing slave, (but no blood money). If the believing deceased belonged to a nation with whom you have a pact of alliance, then the penance involves payment of blood money to the family (of the believing deceased), in addition to the freeing of the believing slave. The one who does not find (the financial means) must observe fasts daily for two consecutive months to seek forgiveness from Allah. Of course, Allah is all-Knowing and the Wisest"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":93,"Text":"Hellfire is the punishment for anyone who kills a believer intentionally and willfully. He shall stay there forever. He incurs the wrath and the curse of Allah. For such a one, He has prepared the severest (most awful) torment"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":94,"Text":"Oh you who believe! When you go out (to fight) in the path of Allah, make a distinction (between friends and foes). If someone wishes you the greeting of Islam, do not _ seeking the benefits of this world _ be quick and say, \"You are not the believer.\" Allah has the most abundant booty and benefits for you. In fact, you were like that once, but Allah bestowed His favors upon you. Therefore, (verify and) ascertain the facts first. Indeed, Allah is very well Aware of everything you do"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":95,"Text":"The two are not equal: those who sit at home (and do not join the fighting) _ unless they have a reason; they are handicapped _ and those who strive hard in the path of Allah with their wealth and lives.

Compared to those who sit at home, Allah will award a far greater reward to those who wage a struggle"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":96,"Text":"(He will bestow upon them) a much higher honor by His grace, as well as forgiveness and mercy! Allah is the most Forgiving, and the most Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":97,"Text":"There are those who have wrought a wrong upon themselves (by not migrating with the prophet, as ordered). The angels (of death), would take possession of their souls and ask, \"What was wrong with you?\" They would answer, \"We were too weak and oppressed in the land!\" The angels will say, \"WasnÂ´t the land of Allah vast and spacious enough, so you could emigrate (and seek refuge) elsewhere?\" Such ones would have an abode in hell. What a despicable destination"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":98,"Text":"Except for the men, women and children who are weak and oppressed!
