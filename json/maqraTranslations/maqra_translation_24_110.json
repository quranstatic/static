Also among them is he who if entrusted with one single dinar, would not return it unless you keep asking and he may eventually be pronounced a defaulter. This is by reason of their folly and want of sense that they interpret in words. \"We are not,\" they say, \"under any obligation to these illiterate faithless people -the Muslims-\" and they intentionally relate to Allah falsehood which they admit into their minds"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":76,"Text":"Indeed he who fulfils his promise when he pledges himself before Allah to do what is to be done, keeps the vow when he binds himself by one, his words and deeds together accord and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah shall come in the grace of Allah for Allah likes those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":77,"Text":"Those who exchange Allah’s covenant or a vow to heaven or an oath that is binding for a miserable price featured in the vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world shall be denied Allah’s grace Hereafter.

Rather he would ask of them by virtue of right and authority to pay reverence and veneration to Allah, the Creator, and to adore Him with appropriate acts and rites and devotion. This is the logical sequence which Allah has imparted to them, the divine knowledge which they have imparted to people, the divine knowledge which they themselves have applied their minds to its acquisition"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":80,"Text":"Allah does not ordain that you take the angels and the Prophets as tutelary deities.

Now do you all subscribe to this allegiance and shall you pledge yourselves before Me to keep the vow!\" They said: \"We pray the prayer and vow the vow.\" \"Then,\" Allah said, \"you bear witness to this obligation which you shall relate to your people, and here do I subscribe to be also a witness to this course of action"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":82,"Text":"Therefore, those who counsel deaf to this obligation are the perverse who are faithless and morally depraved"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":83,"Text":"Is it a system of faith and worship other than that ordained by Allah that they desire, when to His blessed will have all creation in the heavens and on earth submitted willingly or unwillingly and in the end back to Him shall all return"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":84,"Text":"O Muhammad, declare in explicit terms: We Muslims believe in Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues. We believe in all that has been imparted to us in the Quran and in all that was imparted to Ibrahim and Isma’il, to Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya’qub (Jacob) and to the tribes of his twelve sons and in what was imparted to Mussa and to ‘Isa.

He is the heart of our purpose"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":85,"Text":"He who adopts a system of faith and worship other than Islam simply bends on a system of faith and worships which does not have the standing upon the vantage ground of truth.
