(Some do so because they believe that it is the expected final Revelation, and some because it contains passages confirming their Books and Prophets.) Yet among those parties (responding to the Book), some deny some of it (because it discloses their interpolations in their Books and does not serve their interests). Say (O Messenger): \"I have only been commanded to worship God and not to associate any partners with Him. To Him I call (all people), and to Him is my destined return"},{"SurahNumber":13,"VerseNumber":37,"Text":"And so (as a Book, whose message is founded on belief in and worship of One God, and which should therefore be accepted by all who were given the Book before) We send down (this Qur’an) as a final judgment in the Arabic tongue.
