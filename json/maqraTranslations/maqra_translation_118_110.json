He whom Allah guides to His path and Providence his guide is indeed guided into all truth, whereas he whom Allah sends astray, never shall you find for him a tutelary guide"},{"SurahNumber":18,"VerseNumber":18,"Text":"You would have thought they were awake -probably their eyes were open- though they were fast asleep. And We turned them over from one side to the other right and left while on the threshold lay their dog with his forelegs outstretched. If you had seen them you would have run away from them making your escape, filled with horror"},{"SurahNumber":18,"VerseNumber":19,"Text":"So conditioned, We aroused them and stirred them into activity only to question each other as to the length of time they had laid themselves to rest. \"How long do you think you have been in this place to repose your wearied virtues?\" asked one of them. \"Probably a day or less\", they said. \"Allah, your Creator, knows best how long. Meantime send one of you with this silver coin to town in quest of the best food and he brings back some of it to satisfy our hunger, but he must be gentle and courteous and not to attract attention or fix directly upon himself nor indirectly upon you the notice of others"},{"SurahNumber":18,"VerseNumber":20,"Text":"For, should they discover your identity\", he continued, \"they will over power you, pelt you with stones or else turn you renegades and your purpose shall be defeated here and Hereafter"},{"SurahNumber":18,"VerseNumber":21,"Text":"To serve Our purpose We ordained that their identity be revealed so that they, as well as others, would realize that the promise of Allah is truth personified and that the Day of Judgement is a certainty. The aftermath of the event resolved itself in the manner that was inevitably expected. The people who by then had conformed to Allah's will â€“Christians- debated the number and the event and its significance, some concluding to construct a memorial on the site, others whose decision prevailed resolved to erect a house of worship thereon"},{"SurahNumber":18,"VerseNumber":22,"Text":"Tossed with their unballasted wits in fathomless and unquiet deeps of controversies, Ahl AL-Kitab (the People of the Book) were divided in opinion relative to the number of the young men, and in the course of time, some will say: \"They numbered three and their dog the fourth\". Others will say: \"Five, their dog the sixth\", an exercise of divination, whereas others will say: \"Seven, their dog the eighth\". Say to them O Muhammad: \"Allah, my Creator, knows best their number; it is only a few who have been given the knowledge of the number and the significance of the even\". Therefore, do not involve yourself O Muhammad in the heat of their dispute but treat the subject from an objective standpoint only so as to exhibit the actual facts and never seek counsel from any of them upon the event"},{"SurahNumber":18,"VerseNumber":23,"Text":"(It is not in mortals to command success). Therefore, do not resolve upon doing something the morrow without appending \"Allah willing"},{"SurahNumber":18,"VerseNumber":24,"Text":"That is \"if it be the will of Allah\". And should you forget this divine axiom, then call Allah to mind and invoke Him to guide you to a better choice than that which you had in mind \"I pray and beseech You O Allah, my Creator, to guide me to a better choice than that which I had in mind"},{"SurahNumber":18,"VerseNumber":25,"Text":"They (Ahl AL- Kitab surmised that they -the young men-) remained dormant in the Cave for three hundred years -solar calendar- with an additional nine years -lunar calendar"},{"SurahNumber":18,"VerseNumber":26,"Text":"Say to them O Muhammad: \"Allah alone knows how long they stayed in the cave. Knowledge of the mysteries of the heavens and the earth is a divine prerogative attributed only to Allah. How infinite is His vision arid how unlimited is His audition. Besides Him. People have no tutelary guardian. His Authority, Sovereignty and Command are absolute and independent and no one does He permit to go shares with Him in any measure or degree"},{"SurahNumber":18,"VerseNumber":27,"Text":"And recite O Muhammad what has been inspired to you of the Book -the Quran- of Allah, your Creator, Whose words no one nor any expedient or any power can alter nor will you find besides Him a tutelary protector to afford you shelter"},{"SurahNumber":18,"VerseNumber":28,"Text":"Be patient O Muhammad and rest content with those who invoke Allah's mercy and conciliation morning and evening in quest of nothing but His acceptance and His countenance speaking good will. And let not your mind's eyes turn aside from them or vacillate between them and the worldly-minded, setting your thoughts upon the ephemeral and fleeting glories of the world. Nor should you obey the one neglecting his duty to Allah and by consequence We closed his heart's ears, the one who counsels deaf and lusts after his vain desires and carries his vanity to excess that he cannot be reclaimed from a life of vice nor will he be reclaimed by Allah's grace"},{"SurahNumber":18,"VerseNumber":29,"Text":"And say to them: \"Allah's truth has come to guide us into all truth and he who wishes to acknowledge it with judgement and choice is free to do so and he who wishes to reject it is free to do so. We have prepared for the wrongful of actions a fire whose scorching and merciless flames beset them on all sides as if it were a bed having an arched canopy and covered sides. As often as they cry for help they are given a draught of boiling water like molten brass or molten lead scalding the faces; evil indeed is the drink and evil is the society"},{"SurahNumber":18,"VerseNumber":30,"Text":"Indeed those whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety are the recipients of Allah's mercy and divine reward.
