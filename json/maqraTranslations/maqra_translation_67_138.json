The complete term would take forty nights, in two stages of thirty and ten to make it easy for him. Before leaving for Mount Sinai, Moses assigned his brother Aaron, as his deputy and told him to keep social order after him and not to be intimidated by the problem makers"},{"SurahNumber":7,"VerseNumber":143,"Text":"When Moses arrived at the appointed time, and his Lord spoke to him, Moses said, \"My Lord! Show me Yourself, such that I can see You.\" His Lord said, \"You cannot see Me. The best way to see Me is to look at this mountain and think. If you contemplate, you will understand that even a single mountain is made of countless atoms that were scattered. Then consider that you have seen Me.\" Realizing this, Moses imagined the Glory of His Lord through His signs in the Universe. He was stunned and when he recovered his senses, he said, \"Infinite are You in Your Glory! I feel embarrassed and repent at my question. I am among the foremost believers.\" (The 7,359 feet high Mount Sinai is standing to this day. Therefore contrary to popular literal translation of this verse, its understanding in allegorical terms is preferred. Also, a Prophet of God is unlikely to make a demand to behold God in physical form)"},{"SurahNumber":7,"VerseNumber":144,"Text":"God said, \"O Moses! I have chosen you to be My Messenger and convey My Word to the people. I have given to you My Messages and spoken to you. Hold on to these Commands and be appreciative by sharing My Bounty of Revelations with people"},{"SurahNumber":7,"VerseNumber":145,"Text":"We ordained for him in, the Tablets of Law, Enlightenment and clearly spelled out Guidance. And told him, \"Uphold these teachings strongly, and tell your people to uphold them. These are excellent teachings. I will soon let you and your people see (how blessed the outcome of compliance will be and) to which abode the drifters will be headed"},{"SurahNumber":7,"VerseNumber":146,"Text":"The Law stands* that those who are proud on earth without justification will turn away from My revelations. Even if they went through the entire script, and saw clear evidence of the Truth, their arrogance will keep them from believing. When they see the right guidance, they do not accept it, but they readily accept straying. This is because they choose to preemptively deny Our Revelations and to remain unaware of the wisdom in them. (*The consequences according to the Law of Requital, Allah ascribes to Himself, such as \"Allah did it)"},{"SurahNumber":7,"VerseNumber":147,"Text":"Those who deny our Messages and the meeting of the Hereafter, their works are fruitless. Are they rewarded anything but what they deserved for their decisions"},{"SurahNumber":7,"VerseNumber":148,"Text":"The people of Moses made up a calf out of their ornaments while Moses was on the Mount Sinai. They made it such that blowing into it produced a lowing sound. They didn't even see that it couldn't talk to them or show them any way. Still they chose it as a god, and thus wronged their own \"Self"},{"SurahNumber":7,"VerseNumber":149,"Text":"When they regretted their action and realized that they had gone astray, they said, \"Unless our Lord embraces us with Mercy and forgives us, we surely will be lost"},{"SurahNumber":7,"VerseNumber":150,"Text":"Moses returned to his people and was upset and grieved. He said, \"You have chosen a terrible thing after me. Do you wish your Lord's Law of Requital to smite you soon (20:86)? He placed the tablets of the Commands among them and questioned his brother, Aaron, very strictly. Aaron explained, \"O Son of my mother! These people treated me harshly and took my patience as weakness, and almost killed me. Let not my opponents rejoice, and count me not among the wrongdoers.\" (Seizing the beard and head is indicative of interrogating harshly. Aaron had been extra patient with their idolatry to avoid division among them (20:94). Aaron, the Prophet of God, preferred SHIRK over Sectarianism. This is how reprehensible sectarianism and division in religion is"},{"SurahNumber":7,"VerseNumber":151,"Text":"Moses said, \"My Lord! Forgive me, and my brother and admit us in Your Grace. You are the Most Merciful among the gracious"},{"SurahNumber":7,"VerseNumber":152,"Text":"Those who chose the calf for worship, have incurred their Lord's Requital, and humiliation in the life of this world.

He appointed seventy of his people as officers to prevent the nation from wavering. An earthquake shook them (2:55) and Moses said, \"My Lord! You could have destroyed them and me before, if You so willed (when they asked to see God in physical form (2:55)). Would you destroy us for the actions of the ignorant among us? This must be Your trial for us. You have appointed Laws of straying and guidance. You are our Protecting Friend. Forgive us and have Mercy on us. You are the Best of forgivers"}]}
