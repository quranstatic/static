He will be their Protecting Friend because of what they used to do"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":128,"Text":"The day will come when He gathers all of them and says, \"O You nomads! You have seduced many of the urbanites.\" Their urbanite friends will say, \"Our Lord! We enjoyed each other's company (and both used each other opportunistically as happens in a chaotic society) until we wasted a life span You had given us. He will say, \"Fire is your home. Abide therein forever since Allah's Laws never change. Your Lord, the Wise, All-Knowing has designed the Law of Requital"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":129,"Text":"Thus Our Law makes the wrongdoers keep company towards a common earning. (The criminals of the same kind tend to hang around together)"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":130,"Text":"O You, assembly of the nomads and the urbanites! Did not Messengers come to you from among you, who conveyed to you My Messages and warned you of the meeting of this your Day? They will say, \"We testify against ourselves.\" Pursuit of only the worldly life preoccupied their hearts and minds. They will bear witness against themselves that they disregarded the Truth"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":131,"Text":"And so it is that your Lord never destroys communities arbitrarily while their people are unaware of their wrongdoings"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":132,"Text":"The ranks of all individuals and nations are determined solely by their deeds, and your Lord is not unaware of what they do.

Do all that is in your power. Behold, I am working. Very soon, you will come to know for which of us is the ultimate success. Violators of human rights will never be successful"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":136,"Text":"(How can their program succeed when their belief system and the resulting actions are wrong?) They set aside a portion of Allah's provision of crops and cattle and claim, \"This is for Allah, and this is for our idols.\" But the share of their idols never reaches Allah, and the share of Allah does reach their idols. What an unjust decision they make! (Their priesthood devours both portions of their making, and the poor remain wanting. To Allah reaches what you spend on the needy)"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":137,"Text":"(At the prompting of the mystics and monks, and in the name of their temples, idols, sanctuaries, and the dead \"holy\" men and women), the MUSHRIKEEN do acts of omission and commission against their own children! They inflict great pain upon themselves and their families in the name of religion. If they followed Allah's Commands, they wouldn't have done it.

Such are their fabrications in His Name. Soon He will reward them for their false imagery"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":139,"Text":"(They display their bias toward women in weird ways.) They say, \"What is in the bellies of these cattle is reserved for the males among us, and forbidden to our wives.\" But if it is a stillbirth, they permit their wives to share it. He, the Wise, the Knower, will repay them for their innovations"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":140,"Text":"Lost indeed are those who kill their children foolishly, and forbid what Allah has provided them as sustenance. And they attribute their innovations to Allah!

Their straying is far from the way of the rightly guided"}]}
