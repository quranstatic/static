For the disbelievers, We have prepared a disgraceful punishment"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":38,"Text":"And (also) for those who flaunt (and flash), when they spend their wealth, in order to show off to the people. They do not believe in Allah or the Day of Judgment. Whoever has Shaitan as an intimate companion has indeed an evil companion"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":39,"Text":"What harm could have come to them, if they had believed in Allah and the Last Day, and had spent a little out of the sustenance Allah had granted them?

Instead, with a twist of their tongue, they make it sound (as if they said), \"We heard and we disobeyed\", and \"Listen, may you go deaf!\" and ´Raina´ _ (an insult in Hebrew).
