In fact, a lot of rabbis and monks usurp the wealth of others wantonly, and with foul means. They turn people away from the path of Allah. So give the news of a painful punishment to those who amass gold and silver, instead of spending them in the path of Allah"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":35,"Text":"That day _ (the Day of Judgment) _ their treasure would be heated up in the fire of hell. With that (red hot metal) their forehead, flanks and back shall be branded (and charred). \"This is what you had saved up for yourself. Now taste what you had amassed"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":36,"Text":"The fact is, the number of months according to Allah are twelve (in a year). It was so ordained by Allah at the time when He created the heavens and the earth. Four of those months are sacred. Therefore, do not commit a sin against yourself (by violating the sanctity of these months). Fight against the ´mushriqeen´ _ (those who ascribe partners for Allah) _ on all fronts with unity in your ranks, just as they fight you. Be aware, that surely Allah is with the pious"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":37,"Text":"´Nasi´, (the postponement of the sacred months) is another instance (and example) of disbelief, (a practice) by which the unbelievers are led further astray. They deem a month ´not sacred´ one year and declare it to be sacred the next, in order to make up the numbers of sacred months (in a year). Thus, they (find a way to) legitimize what Allah has forbidden. Such an evil course seems pleasing to them. Allah does not guide the nation of unbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":38,"Text":"Oh you who believe! What is the matter with you? When asked to (leave home and) go (into battle) for the sake of Allah, you drag your feet and cling to the ground. Do you prefer the life of this world to the afterlife? Compared to the afterlife, the possessions (and pleasures) of the life of this world are much too meager"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":39,"Text":"If you do not proceed (into battle), Allah will inflict a painful punishment upon you. And in your place, He will bring another nation. You cannot harm Him a bit! Allah has (absolute) power over everything"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":40,"Text":"If you fail to help the prophet, (Allah will)! Allah had certainly helped him when the unbelievers had driven him out (of the town). He was (at that time) one of the two. The two of them were (hiding) in a cave when he said to his companion, \"Do not worry, Allah is with us.\" So Allah, by His grace, caused the (reassuring) peace and serenity to descend upon him. (Allah) strengthened him with forces you could not see. He brought the words (and slogans) of the unbelievers down to the lowest level, while the word of Allah is (always) Supreme. Allah is the Almighty, and the Wisest"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":41,"Text":"Go forth (into battle), whether you are light or laden. With your wealth and life, wage a struggle for the cause of Allah. That is better for you, if you only know"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":42,"Text":"They would have come out and accompanied you if the mission involved a quick gain or an easy journey, but the hardship of the long journey bothers them. Yet, (when you come back) they would swear by Allah and say, \"If we could, we would have accompanied you.\" (Thus), they destroy their souls.
