{"Id":109,"LanguageCodes":["en","eng"],"Name":"eng-aliunal","Author":"Ali Unal","Language":"English","Description":"English","Direction":"ltr","Source":"","Translations":[{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":51,"Text":"You can put off whomever among them (who offer themselves to you freely) you please, and accept to yourself whomever you please, as you can defer the turn of visiting any of them (your wives) you please, and take to you whomever you please. There is no blame on you if you give precedence to one whom you deferred before. It will make it more likely that they are pleased, and do not grieve (when they are deferred), and that all of them will be content with your treatment of them. God knows (O people) whatever is in your hearts. God is indeed All-Knowing, All-Clement"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":52,"Text":"Other women (than those just mentioned and those already married to you ) will not be lawful for you to take; nor, (seeing that they – your wives – have preferred God and His Messenger over the charms of the world) are you allowed to change them for other wives, even though their fineness should please you, except those whom your right hands possess. God is ever watchful over everything"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":53,"Text":"O you who believe! Do not enter the Prophet’s rooms (in his house) unless you have been given leave, (and when invited) to a meal, without waiting for the proper time (when the meal is to be served). Rather, when you are invited, enter (his private rooms) at the proper time; and when you have had your meal, disperse. Do not linger for mere talk. That causes trouble for the Prophet, and he is shy of (asking) you (to leave). But God does not shy away from (teaching you) the truth. When you ask something of them (his wives), ask them from behind a screen. Your doing so is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. It is not for you to cause hurt to God’s Messenger as it is unlawful for you ever to marry his widows after him. That (marrying his widows) would be an enormity in God’s sight"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Whether you reveal something or keep it secret, (know) that surely God has full knowledge of everything"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"There is no blame on them (the wives of the Prophet, if they speak without a screen) with their fathers (including grandfathers and uncles both paternal and maternal), or their sons (including grandsons), or their brothers, or their brothers’ sons, or the sons of their sisters, or the Muslim women and women of good conduct with whom they associate, or those (bondsmaids) whom their right hands possess. Keep, (O wives of the Prophet,) from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety (observing this command as well as all of His other commands). God is indeed a witness over everything"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":56,"Text":"Surely God and His angels bless the Prophet (He always treats him with His special mercy, with the angels praying to Him to grant him the highest station of praise with Him and for the decisive victory of his Religion). O you who believe, invoke the blessings of God on him, and pray to God to bestow His peace on him, greeting him with the best greeting. (Love and follow him with utmost sincerity and faithfulness, and give yourselves to his way with perfect submission)"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":57,"Text":"Those who affront God and His Messenger (through disrespect for Him in words and acts and for His Messenger and Islamic values), God certainly curses them (excludes them from His mercy) in this world and the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a shameful, humiliating punishment"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":58,"Text":"And those who affront believing men and believing women without their having done any wrong to deserve it, they have surely burdened themselves with calumny and a blatant sin"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":59,"Text":"O (most illustrious) Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters, as well as the women (wives and daughters) of the believers, to draw over themselves some part of their outer garments (when outside their homes and when before men whom they are not forbidden to marry because of blood relation). This is better and more convenient for them to be recognized (and respected for their decency and decorum) and not harrassed. God is indeed All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate"}]}
