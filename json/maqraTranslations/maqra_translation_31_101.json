Fear your Lord Who created you from a single being and out of it created its mate; and out of the two spread many men and women. Fear Allah in Whose name you plead for rights, and heed the ties of kinship. Surely, Allah is ever watchful over you"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Give orphans their property, and do not exchange the bad for the good, and do not eat up their property by mixing it with your own. This surely is a mighty sin"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"If you fear that you might not treat the orphans justly, then marry the women that seem good to you: two, or three, or four. If you fear that you will not be able to treat them justly, then marry (only) one, or marry from among those whom your right hands possess. This will make it more likely that you will avoid injustice"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"Give women their bridal-due in good cheer (considering it a duty); but if they willingly remit any part of it, consume it with good pleasure"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"Do not entrust your properties - which Allah hasmade a means of support for you - to the weak of understanding, but maintain and clothe them out of it, and say to them a kind word of admonition"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"Test the orphans until they reach the age of marriage, and then if you find them mature of mind hand over to them their property, and do not eat it up by either spending extravagantly or in haste, fearing that they would grow up (and claim it). If the guardian of the orphan is rich let him abstain entirely (from his ward's property); and if he is poor, let him partake of it in a fair measure. When you hand over their property to them let there be witnesses on their behalf. Allah is sufficient to take account (of your deeds)"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"Just as there is a share for men in what their parents and kinsfolk leave behind, so there is a share for women in what their parents and kinsfolk leave behind - be it little or much - a share ordained (by Allah)"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"If other near of kin orphans and needy are pre sent at the time of division of inheritance give them some thing of it and speak to them kindly"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"And let them fear, those who, if they would themselves leave behind helpless offspring, they would surely have been fearful on their account.

If (the heirs of the deceased are) more than two daughters, they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance; and if there is only one daughter, then she shall have half the inheritance. If the deceased has any offspring, each of his parents shall have a sixth of the inheritance; and if the deceased has no child and his parents alone inherit him, then one-third shall go to his mother; and if the deceased has brothers and sisters, then one-sixth shall go to his mother. All these shares are to be given after payment of the bequest he might have made or any debts outstanding against him. You do not know which of them, your parents or your children, are more beneficial to you. But these portions have been determined by Allah, for He indeed knows all, is cognizant of all beneficent considerations"}]}
