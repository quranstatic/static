{"Id":103,"LanguageCodes":["en","eng"],"Name":"eng-aishabewley","Author":"Aisha Bewley","Language":"English","Description":"English","Direction":"ltr","Source":"","Translations":[{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"You who have iman! fulfil your contracts. All livestock animals are halal for you, except those that are recited to you now; but it is still not halal to hunt while you are in ihram. Allah makes whatever judgements He wills"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"You who have iman! do not profane the sacred rites of Allah or the sacred months, or the sacrificial animals, or the ritual garlands, or those heading for the Sacred House, desiring profit and good pleasure from their Lord. When you have come out of ihram, then hunt for game. Do not let hatred for a people who debar you from the Masjid al-Haram incite you into going beyond the limits. Help each other to goodness and taqwa. Do not help each other to wrongdoing and enmity. Have taqwa of Allah. Allah is severe in retribution"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Haram for you are carrion, blood and pork, and what has been consecrated to other than Allah, and animals which have been strangled, and animals which have been killed by a blow, and animals which have fallen to their death, and animals which have been gored, and animals which wild beasts have eaten — except those you are able to slaughter properly — and animals which have been sacrificed on altars, and deciding things by means of divining arrows — that is deviance. Today the kuffar have despaired of overcoming your deen. So do not be afraid of them but be afraid of Me. Today I have perfected your deen for you and completed My blessing upon you and I am pleased with Islam as a deen for you. But if anyone is forced by hunger, not intending any wrongdoing, Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"They will ask you what is halal for them. Say: ´All good things are halal for you, and also what is caught for you by hunting animals which you have trained as Allah has taught you. Eat what they catch for you, mentioning Allah´s name over it.´ And have taqwa of Allah. Allah is swift at reckoning"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"Today all good things have been made halal for you. And the food of those given the Book is also halal for you and your food is halal for them. So are free women from among the muminun and free women of those given the Book before you, once you have given them their dowries in marriage, not in fornication or taking them as lovers. But as for anyone who rejects iman, his actions will come to nothing and in the Next World he will be among the losers"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"You who have iman! when you get up to do salat, wash your faces and your hands and your arms to the elbows, and wipe over your heads, and wash your feet to the ankles. If you are in a state of major impurity, then purify yourselves. But if you are ill or on a journey, or have come from the lavatory, or have touched women, and cannot find any water, then do tayammum with pure earth, and wipe your faces and your hands. Allah does not want to make things difficult for you, but He does want to purify you and to perfect His blessing upon you so that hopefully you will be thankful"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"Remember Allah´s blessing to you and the covenant He made with you when you said, ´We hear and we obey.´ Have taqwa of Allah. Allah knows what the heart contains"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"You who have iman! show integrity for the sake of Allah, bearing witness with justice. Do not let hatred for a people incite you into not being just. Be just. That is closer to taqwa. Have taqwa of Allah. Allah is aware of what you do"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"Allah has promised those who have iman and do right actions forgiveness and an immense reward"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"But those who are kafir and deny Our Signs, are the Companions of the Blazing Fire"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"You who have iman! remember Allah´s blessing to you when certain people were on the verge of raising their hands against you and He held their hands back from you.
