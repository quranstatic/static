Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him) in repentance"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"And they (to whom you call) became divided only after knowledge came to them— Through selfish transgression and envy between themselves. If it was not for a Word that reached them before from your Lord, (regarding) a period (for repentance) appointed, the matter would have been settled between them. And truly, those (the Jews and Christians) who have inherited the Book (of Message, Torah and Gospel) after them are in (uneasy and) suspicious doubt about it (the Quran)"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Now then, for that (reason), call (them to the Faith), and stand firm, as you are commanded, nor you follow their vain desires; But say: \"I believe in the Book which Allah has sent down; And I am commanded to judge justly between you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord: For us (is the responsibility for) our deeds, and for you (is the responsibility for) your deeds. There is no dispute between us and you. Allah will bring us together and to Him is (our) final return"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"And those who dispute about Allah after He has been accepted— Their dispute is useless in the sight of their Lord: And upon them is Anger (from Allah), and for them will be a terrible penalty"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":17,"Text":"It is Allah Who has sent down the Book in truth, and the Balance (to weigh human conduct). And what will make you realize that possibly the Hour (of Judgment) is close at hand"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":18,"Text":"Only those who wish to hasten it do not believe in it: While, those who believe hold it in fear, and know that it is the very (eternal) Truth. Surely those who dispute concerning the Hour are far astray"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":19,"Text":"Allah is Most Kind (Lateef) to His servants: He gives livelihood to whom He pleases: And He has All Powerful (Qhavi) and Ever-Almighty (Al-Aziz)"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":20,"Text":"To any who desires the reward of the Hereafter, We give increase in his reward; And to any who desires the reward of this world, We grant a part of it, and he has no share in the Hereafter"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":21,"Text":"Or, have they ‘partners’ (the false gods) who have established for them some religion without permission of Allah? If it had not been for the Word of Judgment, (permitting them some freedom of action) the matter would have been decided between them (at once). And surely, the wrongdoers will have a grievous penalty"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":22,"Text":"You will see the wrongdoers in fear because of what they have earned, and of whatever (penalty) that must fall on them. But those who believe and work righteous deeds (will be) in the luxurious shadows in the Gardens. They shall have, before their Lord, all that they wished for. That will truly be the greatest reward (from Allah)"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":23,"Text":"That is (the reward) about which Allah gives glad tidings (and good news) to His servants who believe and do righteous good deeds. Say: \"No reward do I ask of you for this except to be kind to me in the love and kinship.\" And if anyone earns any good and righteous deeds, We shall give him an increase in the good (that he has earned in proper measure): Verily, Allah is Often Forgiving (Ghafoor), Most Appreciative (Ash-Shukoor, of the service from His servants)"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":24,"Text":"Or, do they say: \"He has made up lies against Allah?\" If Allah so willed, He could close up your heart. And Allah removes (false) pride, and proves the Truth by His Words.
