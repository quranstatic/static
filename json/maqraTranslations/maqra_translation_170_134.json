Nor is it an offence for you to receive any of those whom you have temporarily set aside. That is more proper, so that they may be contented and not vexed, and may all be pleased with what you give them. God knows what is in your¹ hearts.

But if you are invited, enter; and when you have eaten, disperse. Do not engage in familiar talk, for this would annoy the Prophet and he would be ashamed to bid you go; but of the truth God is not ashamed. If you ask his wives for anything, speak to them from behind a curtain. This is more chaste for your hearts and their hearts. You must not speak ill of God‘s apostle, nor shall you ever wed his wives after him; this would surely be a grave offence in the sight of God"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Whether you reveal a thing or conceal it, God has knowledge of all things"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"It shall be no offence for the Prophet‘s wives to be seen unveiled by their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers‘ sons, their sisters‘ sons, their women, or their slave-girls.
