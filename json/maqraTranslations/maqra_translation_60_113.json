Perhaps, you would understand"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":152,"Text":"Do not touch the assets of an orphan till he comes of age, except with worthy and venerable intentions. (Be just), fill the measure to its full and weigh accurately. We do not burden anyone beyond his capacity to bear.

Do they expect the angels to come to them (with their death warrants)? Or for your Lord (Himself) to show up? Or any one of the (final and manifest) signs from your Lord to appear?
