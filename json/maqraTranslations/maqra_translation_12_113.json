But do not exceed the limit. Indeed, Allah does not like the transgressors"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":191,"Text":"Kill them wherever you find them. Expel them from where they drove you away. Persecution and oppression are worse than killing. Do not do battle with them near the sacred house of worship (Makkah), unless it is they who engage you in battle there. If they fight you there, then slay them (there). That is the due punishment for the disbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":192,"Text":"If they desist, then of course Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":193,"Text":"Fight (and confront) them till corruption and repression cease, and until faith in Allah (and justice) prevails!

If you are held back (by circumstances), then make an offering you can afford with ease. Do not shave off your head (the last of the rituals of Hajj or Umrah) till the offering has reached its destination. The one who is sick, or suffers from an affliction of the scalp, may redeem himself by fasting, giving alms, or making an offering. When you are safe (and in Makkah), and anyone wishes to perform the ´umrah´ before (it is time for) Hajj, he should make an offering he can afford with ease. But if he cannot afford to make an offering, he should fast three days during Hajj, and seven days when he returns (home). That makes ten days of fasting in all. This applies to the one whose family is not present at the Holy house of worship.
