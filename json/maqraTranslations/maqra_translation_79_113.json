(In addition, it may be used) to win hearts over (to Islam), to free slaves and those in debt, (to wage a struggle) for the sake of Allah, and to help the wayfarer. It is an obligation imposed by Allah; and Allah is well aware, the Wisest"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":61,"Text":"Among them are those who annoy and hurt the prophet by saying, \"He is all ears _ (he lends his ears to all).\" Say, \"For your own good, he is all ears.

You have denied the truth, after first having professed belief. We may pardon some of you, but We would certainly punish others amongst you because they are really guilty"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":67,"Text":"All hypocrites _ men as well as women _ resemble each other.

Compared to you they had more power. They had a lot more wealth and descendants. So, go ahead and enjoy your share (of life) just like those before you. Stay engrossed (and lost) in play and pleasure, just like those before you. Their efforts (and endeavors) amounted to nothing in the life of this world, or in the afterlife. Such are the losers"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":70,"Text":"Has the news not reached them about the nations before them _ the nation of ´Nooh´, the ´Aads, and the ´Samoods, as well as the nation of Ibraheem, the people of Midian and the overthrown cities?

After accepting Islam they have disbelieved! They attempted to do what they could not carry out. How hostile (and resentful) are they, simply because Allah, by His grace and through His messenger, enriched them! It would be to their advantage if they repented. However, if they turn away, Allah will torment them with a painful punishment in this world, as well as in the life-to-come. They do not have any friends or helpers in this world"}]}
