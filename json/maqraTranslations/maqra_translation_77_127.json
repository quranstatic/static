Behold, many of the rabbis and monks do indeed wrongfully devour men's possessions and turn [others] away from the path of God. But as for all who lay up treasures of gold and silver and do not spend them for the sake of God's - give them the tiding of grievous suffering [in the life to come]"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":35,"Text":"on the Day when that [hoarded wealth] shall be heated in the fire of hell and their foreheads and their sides and their backs branded therewith, [those sinners shall be told:] \"These are the treasures which you have laid up for yourselves! Taste, then, [the evil of] your hoarded treasures"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":36,"Text":"BEHOLD, the number of months, in the sight of God, is twelve months, [laid down] in God's decree on the day when He created the heavens and the earth; [and] out of these, four are sacred: this is the ever-true law [of God]. Do not, then, sin against yourselves with regard to these [months].

They declare this [intercalation] to be permissible in one year and forbidden in [another] year, in order to conform [outwardly] to the number of months which God has hallowed: and thus they make allowable what God has forbidden. Goodly seems unto them the evil of their own doings, since God does not grace with His guidance people who refuse to acknowledge the truth"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":38,"Text":"O YOU who have attained to faith! What is amiss with you that, when you are called upon, \"Go forth to war in God's cause,\" you cling heavily to the earth?

But the enjoyment of life in this world is but a paltry thing when compared with the life to come"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":39,"Text":"If you do not go forth to war [in God's cause], He will chastise you with grievous chastisement, and will place another people in your stead - whereas you shall in no wise harm Him: for, God has the power to will anything"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":40,"Text":"If you do not succour the Apostle, then [know that God will do so -just as] God succoured him at the time when those who were bent on denying the truth drove him away, [and he was but] one of two: when these two were [hiding] in the cave, [and] the Apostle said to his companion, \"Grieve not: verily, God is with us.\" And thereupon God bestowed upon him from on high His (gift of] inner peace, and brought utterly low the cause of those who were bent on denying the truth, whereas the cause of God remained supreme: for God is almighty, wise"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":41,"Text":"Go forth to war, whether it be easy or difficult [for you], and strive hard in God's cause with your possessions and your lives: this is for your own good -if you but knew it"},{"SurahNumber":9,"VerseNumber":42,"Text":"Had there been [a prospect of] immediate gain, and an easy journey, they would certainly have followed thee, [O Prophet:] but the distance was too great for them.
