When believing women come to you as emigrants, test them, (though only) God knows best their faith. Then, if you have ascertained that they are believers, do not return them to the unbelievers. They are not (being believers) lawful (as wives) for the unbelievers nor are the unbelievers lawful (as husbands) for them. But return to them (the unbelievers) whatever they expended (by way of bridal-due when they wed those women). And there will be no blame on you (O believers) if you marry them when you have given them their bridal-due. Also, (on the other side) do not continue to retain disbelieving women in marriage, and ask for the return of whatever you expended as their bridal-due (if they remain among or join the unbelievers), just as the disbelieving men (whose wives have emigrated to you after embracing Islam) have the right to demand the return of whatever they spent.

Do not take for friends and guardians a people who have incurred God’s condemnation and punishment: (people) who are bereft of any hope in the Hereafter (because of what their wickedness has earned), just as the unbelievers are bereft of any hope of (ever seeing again) those in the graves"},{"SurahNumber":61,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"All that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth glorifies God.
