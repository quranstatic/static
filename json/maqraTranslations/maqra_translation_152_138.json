We shall drive the leaders out of power and humiliate them to shame.\" (Historically the Kingdom of Sheba flourished from 1100 to 115 B.C. At their zenith they were the richest nation in the world. Their economy was based on excellent agriculture and international trade. They had the most advanced irrigation systems of the times, with great water dams. Their Kingdom included today's whole of Yemen, Somalia and Ethiopia, and boasting a strong army, they frequently had expansive designs further south and up north. As the inevitable result of worshiping multiple false deities, including the sun, their society was not without inequities of caste and creed. Solomon, the King and the Prophet, planned to subdue the Sheba Empire to thwart their aggressive designs and to protect the region from oppression. And he succeeded magnificently. Queen Bilqis of Sheba and her nation embraced Solomon's Message and reverted to the worship and obedience of the One True God)"},{"SurahNumber":27,"VerseNumber":38,"Text":"(When Solomon found out that the Queen was coming), he said, \"O Chiefs!

He said, \"This success is a blessing from my Lord, that He may try me whether I am grateful or ungrateful. Whoever is grateful is grateful for his own good, and whoever is ungrateful, should know that my Lord is Self-Sufficient, Supremely Honorable"},{"SurahNumber":27,"VerseNumber":41,"Text":"Solomon then said, \"Alter her throne for her that we may see whether she gets the point and comes to guidance or she remains unguided.\" (Solomon's workmen had erased the images of the sun god, inscribed sensible inscriptions and made the throne look even more gorgeous)"},{"SurahNumber":27,"VerseNumber":42,"Text":"So, when she came, she was asked, \"Is your throne like this?\" She said, \"It seems that this is it! We already knew that the Truth is on your side and my chiefs and I have surrendered to it.\" (The previous knowledge about Solomon's character and Kingdom, the distinguished letters he wrote to her and reports by her envoys, and now his superb court had convinced the intelligent and open-minded Queen)"},{"SurahNumber":27,"VerseNumber":43,"Text":"King Solomon redirected her from worshiping others than Allah. She had been one of the disbelieving folk, before. (Solomon advised her that obeying the Laws of Allah could bring not only the best provision in the world but insure eternal success.

It was said, \"Enter the hall.\" When she saw the smooth polished glass floor, she thought that it was a pool of water and she was spellbound. ('Kashafat 'an saqaiha' idiomatically means that she was spellbound, and not that she bared her calves; a common error of many translators. For example, tying one's hand to the neck means miserliness). Solomon said, \"This is a palace paved smooth with slabs of glass.\" She said, \"I have been doing wrong to myself, and now I submit with Solomon to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.\" (She realized that following the Divine Laws ensures the best bounties in this life as well. There are some historical accounts that Solomon and Bilqis got married. But the Rabbinical Talmudic traditions propose that they committed adultery then and there, out of which Nimrod Nebuchadnezzar, the tyrant emperor of Babylon was born! That is of course inconceivable of a Prophet of God)"},{"SurahNumber":27,"VerseNumber":45,"Text":"And, indeed, We sent to Thamud their brother Saleh saying, \"Serve Allah alone.\" They had become divided into two contending classes (the rich and the poor)"},{"SurahNumber":27,"VerseNumber":46,"Text":"Saleh said, \"O My people!
