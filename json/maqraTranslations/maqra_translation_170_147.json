That is more proper, so that their eyes may be cooled, and so that they may not grieve, and so that they will be satisfied with what you have given them.

God is watchful over all things"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":53,"Text":"Believers, do not enter the houses of the Prophet, unless you are invited for a meal. Do not linger until a meal is ready. When you are invited enter and when you have taken your meal, depart. Do not stay on, indulging in conversation. Doing that causes annoyance to the Prophet, though he is too reticent to tell you so, but God is not reticent with the truth. When you ask [the wives of the Prophet] for anything, ask them from behind a curtain. That will be purer for your hearts as well as their hearts. It is not right for you to cause annoyance to the Messenger of God or for you ever to marry his wives after him. Indeed that would be an enormity in the sight of God"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Whether you reveal anything or hide it, God is aware of everything"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"There shall be no blame on them for appearing before their fathers, their sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women or those whom their right hands may possess.
