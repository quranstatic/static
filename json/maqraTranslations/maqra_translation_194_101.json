Allah chooses for Himself whomsoever He pleases and guides to Himself whoever penitently turns to Him"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"They did not split up except after knowledge had come to them, and then only because they wished to commit excesses against each other. Had your Lord not already decreed that judgement would be made later at an appointed time, the matter between them would surely have been decided once and for all. Indeed those who were later made the heirs of the Book are in disquieting doubt about it"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"(This being so, O Muhammad), call people to the same religion and be steadfast about it as you were commanded, and do not follow their desires, and say (to them): “I believe in the Book Allah has sent down. I have been commanded to establish justice among you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We have our deeds and you have your deeds. There is no contention between us and you. Allah will bring us all together. To Him all are destined to return.”"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"Those who contend concerning Allah (after His call has been responded to), their contention is absolutely void in the sight of their Lord.

And what would make you know that the Hour (of Judgement) has drawn near"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":18,"Text":"Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten its coming. But those who believe (in it) hold it in dread and know that the Hour (of Judgement) is bound to come. Lo, those who dispute concerning the coming of the Hour are gone far in error"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":19,"Text":"Allah is Most Gentle to His servants and grants sustenance to whomsoever He pleases. He is All-Strong, Most Mighty"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":20,"Text":"Whoever seeks the harvest of the Hereafter, We shall increase for him his harvest, and whoever seeks the harvest of this world, We shall give him thereof; but he will have no share in the Hereafter"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":21,"Text":"Do they have any associates (of Allah) who have laid down for them a way pertaining to faith which Allah did not sanction? But for the fact that a decree had already been made, the matter between them would have been decided once and for all. Surely a grievous chastisement awaits the wrong-doers"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":22,"Text":"You will see the wrongdoers fearful of the consequence of their deeds which will certainly overtake them. But those who have faith and do good deeds will be in the meadows of the Gardens, wherein they shall have whatever they desire from their Lord; that is the great Bounty"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":23,"Text":"That is the Bounty of which Allah gives tidings to His servants who have faith and do good deeds. Tell them, (O Prophet): “I do not ask you for any recompense for my work except love towards kinsfolk.” Whoever does a good deed, We shall increase its merit for him. Surely Allah is Most Forgiving, Most Appreciative"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":24,"Text":"Do they say: “He has forged a lie against Allah?” If Allah so wanted He could seal up your heart.
