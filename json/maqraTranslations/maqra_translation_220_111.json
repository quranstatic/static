And Allah is All-Capable, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"Allah does not forbid you against those who indulged not in Qital against you on account of Religion, and did not drive you out from your houses — that you may deal with them politely and kindly and deal justly towards them. Surely, Allah likes those who deal with equity and justice"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"Certainly, what (is a fact is that) Allah forbids you against those who indulged in Qital against you on account of Religion, and have driven you out from your homes, and they provided assistance to each other in connection with your externment (from your houses) — that you may befriend them. And whosoever will befriend them, then those people: they (very ones) are those who are transgressors"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"O you who have Believed! When have reached you females who have Believed and who are emigrants, then put them to questioning; Allah Knows better about their Faith. Then if you became certain about these women (that they are) Believing females, then do not send them back to the disbelievers; those women are not lawful unto them and nor they become lawful (as husbands) for those women (who have reverted to Islam). And compensate them what these (disbelieving husbands) have spent (as bridal money on these women). And there is no blame on you that you bind in Nikah (wedlock) those women (although no divorce has been pronounced by their previous husbands) when you have paid those women their bridal-money (ujoor or Mahr). Likewise do not continue the links of wedlock of the disbelieving women. And you should demand what you spent (on such women as bridal-money); and let those (disbelieving husbands like wise) ask (as demand) what they have spent (on those women who have reverted to Islam and have deserted them). This unto you (is) Allah’s Ordainment. He makes judgment amongst you. And Allah is All-Aware, All-Wise"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"And if any one of your wives has deserted you in favour of the disbelievers, and you counteracted in retaliation (and are satisfied that the deserting wives have no intention to honor their existing wedlock), then pay to those whose wives have left (them)— similar to what they have spent. And pay (sincere) obedience to Allah — That One, you are in Him, Believers"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"O you An-Nabi (The Prophet)! When Believing females have reached you— these women give you a pledge over — that they shall not set anything to be in partnership with Allah, and they shall not commit theft, and they shall not indulge in Zina and they shall not slay their offsprings, and they shall not approach with a slander which they shall falsely implicate (to the womb) between their hands and their legs, and shall not disobey you in desirable (ordainments and verdicts) — then accept their pledge and ask Allah for their forgiveness. Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, continuously Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"O you people who have accepted Faith! Do not take as friends a nation Allah has made His wrath descend over them. They are indeed despaired of the Hereafter the way the disbelievers despair about the dwellers of the graves"},{"SurahNumber":61,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth has glorified Allah.

Why do you hurt me, although indeed you know that I am Rusulullah (Messenger of Allah) to you?” So when they became hard (in their attitude), Allah made their hearts hard (and unreceptive). And Allah does not guide the nation of Al-Fasiqun"},{"SurahNumber":61,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"And (bring to mind) when Iesa Ibn-e-Maryam (son of Mary) said: “O Bani Israiel! Without any doubt I am Rasulullah (Messenger of Allah) unto you — as a confirmer and verifier for that which is inbetween my two hands as Taurat; and as Mubasshir (one who transmits glad news in advance) about a Rasul (Messenger) — he comes after me, his name (would be) Ahmad.” So when he came to them (whom Iesa was addressing, i.e., Bani Israiel) alongwith Al-Bayyinat (‘The Evidently clear items’) they (i.e., Bani Israiel) said: “This (Al-Bayyinat) is evident magic.” [Please refer Verses 2/87, 253; 5/110; and 43/63 where Iesa comes alongwith Al-Bayyinat. Allah’s Book is permanent and immune to change. It has made itself evident to each and every Prophet of God. It is being propagated to mankind since Day-one and continues to be propagated till the Last Day. This very Book shall examine all mankind individually on the Day of Accountability. Note that the word Taurat has been used as an attribute for Al-Kitab which Prophet Iesa holds in his hand and is propagating to his people. Also note that the word Taurat, although present at 18 places in Allah’s Book, has nowhere been used as an attribute for Al-Kitab in relation to Prophet Musa! Please note that this new Rasul comes after Iesa and not the vice versa]"},{"SurahNumber":61,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"And who is a more transgressing one than that who forged a lie in the name of Allah, while he is being invited to Islam?

Become Ansarullah — the way said Iesa, son of Maryam to Al-Hawariyyun, “Who (would become) my Ansar (those who assist and help me) towards (the Cause of) Allah?” Al-Hawariyyun (the newly reverted ones) said: “We are Ansar unto Allah.” Then a group out of Bani Israiel accepted Faith while (the other) group disbelieved. So We assisted those who had Believed against their enemy, then they became uppermost ones"}]}
