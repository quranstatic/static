Follow not the steps of satanic people in the community. Anyone who follows Satan's steps, should know that he advocates evil and vice. Had it not been for the Favor of Allah, and His Grace unto you, none of you could have grown in goodness. Thus it is - but anyone can develop the \"Self\" (attain Self-actualization) by following Allah's Laws (given in the Qur'an).

Let not those among you who have been blessed with resources and ease of life ever stay behind in spending on: Their families, Relatives, Those who have lost their jobs, Whose running businesses have stalled, Whose hard earned income is insufficient to meet their needs, and Those who have forsaken the domain of evil or persecution in the Cause of Allah. Let them pardon and overlook the imperfections of the needy. Listen! Do you not love that Allah should forgive you, absolving your imperfections? Thus it is - Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":24,"VerseNumber":23,"Text":"But, verily, those who accuse chaste women, mentally preoccupied, believers in Divine Moral Values, shall be rejected from the Grace of Allah in this world and in the life to come.

That they should not display their beauty and ornament beyond what is decently and spontaneously apparent in daily lives. Hence, let them cover their bosoms with their sash (Dupatta). And let them not display their beauty in the presence of anyone other than their husbands or fathers or husbands' fathers, or their sons or their husbands' sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons or sisters' sons, or their womenfolk, or their close dependents and attendants free of sexual desires.

And if any of the male and female slaves desires a deed of freedom, write it out for them if you ensure good for them by way of rehabilitation. (4:5-6). Give them from Allah's wealth that He has given you. Never hold your slave maidens for worldly gains from preserving their chastity by marrying if they so desire, lest they resort to lewdness. If anyone forces them, then after this compulsion Allah will be Forgiving, Merciful to them. (And He will hold the one who forces them, accountable)"},{"SurahNumber":24,"VerseNumber":34,"Text":"And indeed, We have revealed to you Messages clearly showing the Truth, and many a lesson from the generations before you.
