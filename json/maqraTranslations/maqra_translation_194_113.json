What We have revealed to you are the same commandments as We gave to (the messengers) Ibraheem, Musa and Jesus: (namely) to establish the faith and not (disunite and) splinter into sects. (Oh Muhammad, SAW), what you are calling them towards _ (the worship of the One true god, Allah) _ is too burdensome to bear for those accepting other gods beside Him. Allah selects whom He wants, and guides along His path the one who turns to Him (in repentance)"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"But they splintered into groups even though (divine) knowledge had already come to them, because they wished to (encroach upon and) violate each other´s rights. The matter between them would have been settled, had it not been for the fact that the verdict of your Lord is destined to occur at an appointed time. Indeed, about that, those inheriting the book are gravely in doubt"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Such is the case! Therefore, (oh Muhammad, SAW), invite (towards His way), and just as you have been ordered, strictly adhere to it yourself. Do not (ever) follow their wishes and whims. Say, \"I believe in the books Allah has revealed. My orders are to treat you fairly. Allah is my Lord and He is your Lord too. Our deeds are for us, and for you are yours! (Let there be) no argument between you and us. Allah will gather and summon us before Him. Towards Him is our return"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"Some people _ (the unbelievers) _ argue about Allah with those who have heard and accepted His call. The arguments and contentions of such people are absurd according to Allah. His wrath will befall them. There exists a severe punishment for them"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":17,"Text":"Allah it is, Who has revealed the Book with the truth and the balance (to weigh and check all your deeds for correctness). You just do not know! The hour (of Judgment) may be very close, right around the corner"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":18,"Text":"Only the disbelievers (flippantly) ask for it _ (the hour of Judgment) _ to be hastened. The believers, however, are gravely concerned. They know it to be the absolute truth. Be sure! Those who waver and hesitate (and stay in doubt) about the hour have indeed strayed far away"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":19,"Text":"Allah is Gracious to His servants. He supplies (ample) provisions to whom He wants; He is the Mighty and the Powerful"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":20,"Text":"We multiply the benefits for those who want to reap the worth (of their deeds) in the afterlife. We grant the benefits in this world to those who seek the fruits of their labor, right here in this world. Then, in the afterlife they shall have nothing (left)"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":21,"Text":"Do they have gods, the partners (of Allah), who enact the rites and rules of religion for them _ (rules) that are not approved by Allah? The verdict of Allah has been decreed; else their matter would certainly be brought to a close right away. For the evildoers there exists a painful punishment"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":22,"Text":"(On that day), you will find the evildoers scared stiff of what they had committed (in this life); what they have committed would come crashing down on them. But those who believe and act righteously, would be in the gardens of paradise. With their Lord, they shall find everything their hearts desire. That, indeed is the greatest honor"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":23,"Text":"That is the good news Allah has for His servants, those of them who believe and do the righteous deeds. Say, \"For this (Qur´an,) I do not ask any compensation from you, except the kindness that kinship warrants.\" (Let) whoever earns good deeds (know that) We will increase the benefits (and the worth) of their good deeds. Of course, Allah is Forgiving; and He appreciates gratitude"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":24,"Text":"Do they claim that he, (the messenger), has fabricated a lie about Allah? (Oh prophet)! If Allah wants, He can place a seal upon your heart! Allah wipes out the absurd, the false and futile; and He validates the truth with His words. Indeed, He is Aware of everything (including the unexpressed secrets) buried in the chest"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":25,"Text":"He it is, Who (hears and) accepts His servants´ repentance. He overlooks and excuses (many of) your misdeeds; but He does know everything you do"},{"SurahNumber":42,"VerseNumber":26,"Text":"He answers the prayers of those who believe and act righteously. In fact, by His grace He grants them far in excess (of what they seek). As for the unbelievers, theirs is the severe punishment"}]}
