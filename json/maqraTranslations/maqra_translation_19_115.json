Whatever wealth you spend in charity, it is to your own advantage; provided you give to seek the pleasure of Allah. Whatever wealth you spend for the sake of Allah, will be paid back to you in full, and you will not be wronged"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":273,"Text":"Charity is for those needy people who are engaged so much in the cause of Allah that they cannot move about in the land to earn their livelihood: the ignorant think that they are wealthy on account of their modest behavior. You can recognize them by their look because they do not make insistent demands on people. Whatever you spend on them, surely Allah knows it"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":274,"Text":"Those who spend their wealth in charity by night and day, secretly and openly, they will have their reward from their Lord. They shall have nothing to fear or to regret"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":275,"Text":"Those who live on usury will not rise up before Allah except like those who are driven to madness by the touch of Satan. That is because they claim: \"Trading is no different than usury, but Allah has made trading lawful and usury unlawful. He who has received the admonition from his Lord and has mended his way may keep his previous gains; Allah will be his judge. Those who turn back (repeat this crime), they shall be the inmates of hellfire wherein they will live forever"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":276,"Text":"Allah has laid His curse on usury and blessed charity to prosper. Allah does not love any ungrateful sinner"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":277,"Text":"Those who believe and do good deeds, establish regular prayers, and give regular charity will have their reward with their Lord. They will have nothing to fear or to regret"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":278,"Text":"O You who believe! Fear Allah and waive what is still due to you from usury if you are indeed believers"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":279,"Text":"or war shall be declared against you by Allah and His Messenger. If you repent, you may retain your principal, causing no loss to debtor and suffering no loss"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":280,"Text":"If the debtor is in a difficulty, grant him time till it is easy for him to repay; but if you waive the sum by way of charity it will be better for you, if you understand it"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":281,"Text":"Fear the Day when you shall all return to Allah; when every one shall be paid in full what they have earned and none shall be dealt with unjustly"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":282,"Text":"O believers! When you deal with each other in lending for a fixed period of time, put it in writing. Let a scribe write it down with justice between the parties. The scribe, who is given the gift of literacy by Allah, should not refuse to write; he is under obligation to write. Let him who incurs the liability (debtor) dictate, fearing Allah his Lord and not diminishing anything from the settlement. If the borrower is mentally unsound or weak or is unable to dictate himself, let the guardian of his interests dictate for him with justice. Let two witnesses from among you bear witness to all such documents, if two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice should bear witness, so that if one of the women forgets anything the other may remind her. The witnesses must not refuse when they are called upon to do so. You must not be averse to writing (your contract) for a future period, whether it is a small matter or big. This action is more just for you in the sight of Allah, because it facilitates the establishment of evidence and is the best way to remove all doubts; but if it is a common commercial transaction concluded on the spot among yourselves, there is no blame on you if you do not put it in writing. You should have witnesses when you make commercial transactions. Let no harm be done to the scribe or witnesses; and if you do so, you shall be guilty of transgression. Fear Allah; it is Allah that teaches you and Allah has knowledge of everything"}]}
