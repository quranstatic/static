This is Allah's Ordinance binding upon you. All other categories are permitted for you in marriage, with mutual consent, as confirmed by giving her a generous marital gift or dowry. You shall seek them in honest wedlock and let marriage be a fortress of chastity for the husband and wife. You shall maintain morality and go not near adultery (17:32). You like to marry women for a better quality of life, so give them their portions as a duty. And there is nothing wrong in adjusting the sum with mutual agreement after the duty has been done. These Laws are given to you by Allah, the Knower, the Wise"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":25,"Text":"As the Qur'an is being revealed to you (O Messenger), the emancipation of the slaves, male and female, is steadily taking place). A man among you who cannot find a free believing woman willing to marry him, should have no hesitation in asking the hand of a believing maiden from her guardian. Allah knows your beliefs and reiterates that all human beings are equal in the Sight of Allah (17:70). Pay them a generous marital gift in kindness. They shall maintain moral behavior, by not committing adultery, or having secret relations. Since their upbringing has been deficient in the environment of slavery, their punishment will be half that of the free women, if they commit indecency after marriage. The permission to marry a bonded woman is for him who fears to commit sin. The better recourse is freeing her first from bondage. Men and women must be patient and exercise self-control while waiting to get married. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":26,"Text":"Allah would explain to you and guide you by the examples of those who were before you, and turn to you (in Mercy).

Consume not one another's wealth wrongfully, not even in mutually agreed trade. Be just in your trade and cause not people to suffer losses.

(2:)"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":30,"Text":"After such clear Guidance, people and nations that indulge in transgressions and injustice, shall form a society that shall easily burn itself according to Our Law of Requital. And the eternal Fire is not far off either"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":31,"Text":"If you refrain from the great transgressions against humanity that are prohibited in the Qur'an i.e. violation of human rights, We have room in Our Laws to remove the slight inequities in your society, and admit you through the gate of honor in this world and the Hereafter"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":32,"Text":"Covet not the qualities bestowed upon others by Allah.

They shall take full care of women with what they spend of their wealth. Allah has made men to excel in some areas and women to excel in some areas. Men must see to it that women are provided for, and that they are able to stand on their feet in the society. So, righteous women are obedient to Allah's Ordinances and guard their moral values even in privacy, the Values that Allah Commands to be guarded. If you experience rebellion from women, and they stand up against you, apprise them of possible consequences. Next, leave them in their resting places apart from you.
