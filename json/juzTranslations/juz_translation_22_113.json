Allah had done favors upon him, and you had too. You were saying to him, \"Fear Allah, keep your wife and do not divorce her.\" Allah was going to bring out into the open that which you kept hidden in your heart at that time. You were afraid of people, although that is Allah´s right! You should fear Him only! When Zayd had completed his object (of divorcing his wife), We married her to you. (We did that) so the believers may have no restriction in (and may have no stigma attached to) marrying the former wives of their adopted sons, provided the adopted sons had already divorced their wives. The commands of Allah must be fulfilled"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":38,"Text":"No restriction stands in the way of the prophet. Nothing restrains him from carrying out the orders of Allah. This happens to be the established practice of Allah in the case of all the messengers who had gone by earlier.

We have made your wives lawful for you _ provided their agreed nuptial-dower has been paid _ and the slave women Allah has granted you. (Other women lawful for you to marry are): the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts _ those of them who migrated with you (from Makkah)_ and the believing woman who wants to enter the prophet´s household as his wife and he wants to espouse her. This (more than four wives) is an exemption especially for you, not for any other believer. We know what We have mandated for the believers concerning their wives, and the captive women. You are exempted so as to remove the difficulty you face! (The difficulty: the taboo, the culturally imposed restriction against marrying the former wives of the adopted sons, had to be broken by an actual example. It had to be done without divorcing any of the existing wives. The solution: suspend the limit of four wives for the prophet). Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful. NB: Another taboo broken by this divinely ordained marriage was the restriction against cousin marriages. The woman was the prophet´s first cousin"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":51,"Text":"You are being given the right! You may live apart from, or take up residence with whichever wife you want. And you may get back together with any of your wives you had previously estranged. You are not to be blamed.

Allah is all-Knowing, and He is the most Gentle"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":52,"Text":"After this (right) other women are not lawful for you, except the captive women.

Do not enter the prophet´s home, especially at mealtime, unless you have been granted permission. If you are invited to dine at the prophet´s home, arrive on time (not too early) and disperse after you have finished eating. Do not overstay and linger on in conversation. That bothers the prophet, and he is too embarrassed to tell you. But Allah is not ashamed of telling the truth! When you have to ask the wives of the prophet about anything, do so from across a screen. That is more upright, and it keeps your and their hearts more unadultrated. It is not right for you to aggravate the prophet, and it is improper for you to ever marry any of his wives after his death. Indeed that, according to Allah, is a serious offence"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Allah is Aware of every single thing, regardless of whether you express it or keep it undisclosed"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":55,"Text":"It is not improper for the ladies (and will not be held against them), if they converse freely with their fathers, their sons, their brothers and their sons, their sisters´ sons and other women _ including the slave women.
