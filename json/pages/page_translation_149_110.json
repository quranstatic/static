Do not tread other paths lest you miss the path chosen to guide you into all truth. \" This is what He has commended unto you so that you may hopefully entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":154,"Text":"Aforetime We had given Mussa the Book -AL-Tawrah- completed to the taste of those who had obeyed Allah and conformed their will to His will. It was well expounded to interpret all matters and issues , guiding people into all truth and a mercy vouchsafed by Allah to His creatures; they might faithfully realize that they shall inevitably assemble before Him, at the predetermined point of time"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":155,"Text":"And this Quran We sent down as a mercy and knowledge personified, confeing divine favour and invoking blessings on those who have the world all before them and Providence their guide.

Indeed, those who counsel deaf to Our revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority shall be put to the torment laid upon the damned in requital of closing their hearts, ears and their mindsâ€™ eyes to intellectual and spiritual enlightenment"}]}
