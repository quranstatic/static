Sometimes half the night and sometimes close to one-third (of the night). Allah keeps the count of the day and the night (precisely). He knows that you cannot (always) keep time (so accurately). So He has turned to you with kindness and grace. You may recite as much of the Qur´an as you easily can. He knows that (at any given time) some of you would be sick, and others would be travelling in search of Allah´s bounties. Still others would be (engaged in) fighting for the cause of Allah. So recite as much of the Qur´an as you can, establish the ´salat´, pay the ´zakat´ and advance the virtuous loan to Allah. Whatever good deeds you send ahead for yourself are there with Allah. You will receive the rewards for your deeds (on the Day of Judgment), far better and bigger (than your deeds deserve). Seek the forgiveness of Allah, for Allah is oft-Forgiving, the most Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"Oh you, wrapped up (in a cloak)"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Get up and warn (people)"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"And announce that your Lord is the Greatest"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"Cleanse and keep your clothes purified"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"And keep clear away from filth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"Do not seek worldly gains (in return) for favors done"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"Endure (adversity) with patience, for the sake of your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"(Warn everyone that) the day the trumpet sounds"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"Would truly be a long hard day"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"Not at all an easy day for the unbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"So, let Me handle the one whom I created all alone"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"And, I granted him wealth (and resources) in abundance"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"And sons to stand by him"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"I made life comfortable and easy for him"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Yet, he (greedily) desires that I should grant him still more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"Of course not!
