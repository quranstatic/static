Allah measureth the night and the day. He knoweth that ye count it not, and turneth unto you in mercy. Recite, then, of the Qur'an that which is easy for you. He knoweth that there are sick folk among you, while others travel in the land in search of Allah's bounty, and others (still) are fighting for the cause of Allah. So recite of it that which is easy (for you), and establish worship and pay the poor-due, and (so) lend unto Allah a goodly loan. Whatsoever good ye send before you for your souls, ye will find it with Allah, better and greater in the recompense. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O thou enveloped in thy cloak"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Arise and warn"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Thy Lord magnify"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"Thy raiment purify"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"Pollution shun"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"And show not favour, seeking wordly gain"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"For the sake of thy Lord, be patient"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"For when the trumpet shall sound"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"Surely that day will be a day of anguish"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"Not of ease, for disbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Leave Me (to deal) with him whom I created lonely"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"And then bestowed upon him ample means"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"And sons abiding in his presence"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"And made (life) smooth for him"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Yet he desireth that I should give more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"Nay!
