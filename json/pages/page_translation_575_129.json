God determines the duration of the night and day. He knew that it would be hard for you to keep an exact account of the timing of the night prayers, so He turned to you with forgiveness. Thus, recite from the Quran as much as possible. He knew that some of you would be sick, others would travel in the land to seek God's favors, and still others would fight for the cause of God. Thus, recite from the Quran as much as possible, be steadfast in prayer, pay the zakat, and give virtuous loans to God. Whatever good deeds you save for the next life, you will certainly find them with God. This is the best investment, and for this you will find the greatest reward. Ask forgiveness from God. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"Cloaked one"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"stand up, deliver your warning"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"proclaim the greatness of your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"cleanse your clothes"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"stay away from sins"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"and do not think that by doing such deeds, you have done a great favor to God"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"Exercise patience to please your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"When the trumpet is sounded"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"it will be a hard day"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"and for the disbelievers, in particular, it will not be at all easy"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Leave to Me the one, whom I have created all by Myself"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"and whom I have granted abundant wealth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"and children living in his presence"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"whose life I have made run smoothly"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"and who still desires more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"Never will he receive more.
