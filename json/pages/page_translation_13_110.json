{"Id":110,"LanguageCodes":["en","eng"],"Name":"eng-almuntakhabfita","Author":"Almuntakhab Fi Tafsir Alquran Alkarim","Language":"English","Description":"English","Direction":"ltr","Source":"","Translations":[{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":84,"Text":"Again, We entered into another Covenant declaring thus: \"Do not shed your own blood\", We said, \"nor expel each other from your dwellings,\" and you sanctioned it and bore witness to its validity as stated in your own AL-Tawrah"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":85,"Text":"Yet again you ignore the principles you supported and you kill each other and expel some of your own people from their homes and you ally yourselves with their enemies in sin and transgression against the divine law and moral principles. When some of them fall into captivity you revert to the principles in AL-Tawrah and redeem them, albeit the same principles forbid you to shed your own blood nor to expel each other from your homes. Do you people credit part of the Book upon the ground of Allah’s Authority and discredit part upon the ground of your authority? Indeed, he who adopts this line of conduct shall suffer for his offence; he shall be lost to shame here. Such persons shall be delivered to the abyss with its torrential scorching and roaring flames Hereafter; they shall suffer torment and be put to torture; and Allah is not unaware of what you do"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":86,"Text":"These people, O Muhammad, have exchanged the Hereafter for here below, with gazes fixed upon the world and its vanities; their suffering shall never abate nor shall their excruciating pain be mitigated nor can anyone help them out of their misery"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":87,"Text":"You, Bani Isra‘il, know that We gave Mussa AL-Tawrah and We sent other Prophets sequentially: We sent ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam, with clear revelations and signs guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and enlightenment, and We supported him by giving him countenance by the Holy Spirit. Yet is it not indeed incredible that as often as a Prophet is sent to you with divine principles not to your taste, you become extravagant in your account of yourselves and display inordinate self-confidence? Some you renounce and some you accuse of assuming false character, and others you kill or you conspire their death"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":88,"Text":"They say to you, O Muhammad: \"Our hearts’ ears are deaf, and our hearts treasure every branch of divine knowledge and wisdom that we can no longer absorb.\" The fact is Allah has cursed them for their irreverence and impiety. How their faith in Allah is shaken"}]}
