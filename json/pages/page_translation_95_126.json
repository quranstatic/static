Then, once they performed Sajdah, they should move away from you, and the other party, that has not yet performed Salāh, should come and perform Salāh with you, and should take their precautionary measures and their arms. Those who disbelieve would want you to become heedless to your arms and your belongings, so that they come down upon you in a single move. There is no sin on you, if you have some inconvenience due to rain, or you are sick, in putting your arms aside, but take your precautionary measures. Surely, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":103,"Text":"Once you have finished your Salāh, then, remember Allah while standing, sitting and reclining. As soon as you are secure, perform Salāh as due. Surely, Salāh is an obligation on the believers that is tied up with time"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":104,"Text":"Do not show weakness in pursuing these people. If you are suffering, they are suffering as you are suffering, while you hope from Allah what they do not hope.

Do not be an advocate for those who breach trust"}]}
