And Allah is ever Watchful over all things"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":53,"Text":"O you who believe, do not enter the houses of the Prophet, unless you are given permission for a meal; not so early as to wait for the meal to be prepared. But if you are invited, then enter, and when you have eaten, then disperse, without lingering for conversation. Such [behavior] causes annoyance to the Prophet; he is too shy to express it to you, but Allah is not shy of [telling] the truth. And if you ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and their hearts. It is not lawful for you to cause annoyance to Allahâ€™s Messenger, or to ever marry his wives after him, for that is indeed an enormous sin before Allah"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Whether you reveal something or conceal it, Allah is All-Knowing of everything"}]}
