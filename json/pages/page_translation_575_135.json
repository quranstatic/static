Allah determines the night and the day; He knows that you [Muslims] cannot keep an accurate count of it, so He pardoned you. Recite then as much of the Qur’an as is easy for you [in the night prayers]. He knows that there are some among you who will be ill, and others traveling in the land, seeking the grace of Allah, and others fighting in Allah’s way. So recite as much of it as is easy for you; establish prayer and give zakah; and lend to Allah a goodly loan. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, much better in condition and much greater in reward. And seek forgiveness of Allah, for indeed Allah is All-Forgiving, Most-Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O you covered [in your cloak]"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"arise and warn"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"and proclaim the greatness of your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"and purify your garments"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"and shun idol worshiping"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"and do not do a favor for a greater return"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"and be patient for the sake of your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"When the Trumpet is sounded"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"that Day will be a difficult day"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"not easy for the disbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Leave me alone to deal with the one whom I created"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"and gave him abundant wealth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"and sons by his side"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"and gave him a life of comfort and power"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"yet he aspires that I should give him more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"By no means!
