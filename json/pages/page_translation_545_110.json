These are people whose hearts has Allah inscribed with the justification of Faith as a conviction operative on their character and will; He has given them moral support, courage and just confidence. He shall welcome them to His heaven's realm and admit them into gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow, and in the beatitude of heaven they shall experience that vast forever.

But Allah reduced them to impotence in His own manner which they never expected and He inspired terror in their hearts so that as they had tried to ruin the whole tower of Faith, they perfected their own ruin. They demolished their own homes and reduced their own property into a useless from by their own hands and the hands of the believers.
