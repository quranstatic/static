Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you cannot calculate it [exactly], and so He was lenient toward you. So recite as much of the Quran as is feasible. He knows that some of you will be sick, while others will travel in the land seeking Allah’s bounty, and yet others will fight in the way of Allah. So recite as much of it as is feasible, and maintain the prayer and pay the zakat and lend Allah a good loan. Whatever good you send ahead for your souls you will find it with Allah [in a form] that is better and greater with respect to reward. And plead to Allah for forgiveness; indeed Allah is all-forgiving, all-merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O you wrapped up in your mantle"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Rise up and warn"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Magnify your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"and purify your clothes"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"and keep away from all impurity"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"Do not grant a favour seeking a greater gain"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"and be patient for the sake of your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"When the Trumpet will be sounded"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"that will be a day of hardship"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"not at all easy for the faithless"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Leave Me [to deal] with him whom I created alone"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"and furnished him with extensive means"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"[gave him] sons to be at his side"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"and facilitated [all matters] for him"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Still he is eager that I should give him more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"No indeed!
