And God is watchful over all things"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":53,"Text":"O you who believe, do not enter the prophet's homes except if you are invited to a meal, without you forcing such an invitation. But if you are invited, you may enter. And when you finish eating, you shall leave, without staying to wait for news. This used to annoy the prophet, and he was shy to tell you. But God does not shy away from the truth. And if you ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not for you to harm God's messenger, nor that you should marry his wives after him. This is indeed a gross offence with God"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"If you reveal anything, or hide it, God is fully aware of all things"}]}
