Allah has the measures of the night and the day. He knows that you will not be able to keep it up, so He has turned to you in Mercy, therefore, read from the Qur’an as much as you easily can. He knows that there may be some sick people among you, and some others who travel through the land to seek Allah’s bounty; and yet some others fighting for the cause of Allah. Therefore, read as much of the Qur’an as you easily can. Establish the Salah (five time daily prayers) and pay the Zakah (poor due), and give to Allah a goodly loan. Whatever good you will send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, which will be much better and greater in reward. Seek Allah’s forgiveness, surely Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O Muddaththir (the one enveloped - one of the nicknames of Prophet Muhammad)"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Stand up and warn"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Proclaim the greatness of your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"purify your clothes"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"keep yourself away from uncleanliness"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"do not favor others to expect a gain"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"and be patient for the sake of your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"When the Trumpet will be sounded"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"that Day will be a very difficult Day"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"not easy for the disbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Leave Me and the one (Walid bin Mughirah, a staunch opponent of the Prophet) whom I created, alone"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"I gave him abundant resources"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"thriving sons"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"and made his life smooth and comfortable"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Yet he hopes that I shall give him more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"By no means!
