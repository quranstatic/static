Say, \"Allah gives you instructions concerning the inheritance of distant relatives. If a man passes away and has no (living parent or) child, but has a sister, then she inherits half of what he leaves behind. (Similarly) he would inherit from his sister, if she was childless. If a man was survived by two sisters (and no direct heir) they both would inherit two-thirds of what he leaves behind. If the deceased had (no direct heirs, but) brothers and sisters, then the share of the male shall be equal to the share of two females. Allah clarifies matters for you, lest you go astray. Allah is very well Aware of all things"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"Oh you who believe! Abide by your pledges. Made lawful for you (to eat), are all (herbivorous) animals reared as cattle, except those being mentioned (hereunder). Hunting of game is prohibited (during pilgrimage: Hajj and Umrah) while you are wearing the attire of a pilgrim (the Ihram). Of course Allah orders what He pleases"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Oh you who believe! Do not violate the sacred rituals of Allah: the sacred (months of pilgrimage), the sacrificial animals, the garlanded animals pledged as offerings, and the people flocking the sacred house seeking the grace and approval of their Lord. You may hunt once you take off the ´ihram´ _ the ritual attire of pilgrimage. Do not let your hatred (and prejudice) against a nation _ a nation that once forbade you to enter the sacred mosque _ cause you to become unjust and commit excesses. Assist and support each other in matters of virtue and piety. Do not help each other in sin and transgression. Fear Allah! Allah is very severe in (inflicting) punishment"}]}
