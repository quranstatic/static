When you are with them and establish the congregations of prayers for them, let some of you stand guard, and let them hold their weapons standing with you as you prostrate.

Verily, Allah has readied a humiliating suffering for those who deny the Truth"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":103,"Text":"Be mindful of Allah's Commands whatever state you are in, standing, sitting or lying down.
