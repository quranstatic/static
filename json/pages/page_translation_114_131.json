They are listeners to the fallacy, listeners to other people who did not come to you. They distort the words after they had been properly placed. They say, .If you are given this, take it, and if you are not given this, then avoid it. The one whom Allah wills to put to trial, you cannot do anything for him against Allah. They are the ones whose hearts Allah did not intend to purify. For them there is humiliation in this world, and for them there is a great punishment in the Hereafter"}]}
