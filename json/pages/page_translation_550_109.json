Whoever turns away: then (let him know that) God is He Who is the All-Wealthy and Self-Sufficient (absolutely beyond need), the All-Praiseworthy"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"(When you obey God in His commands and prohibitions), it may be that God will bring about love and friendship between you and those of them with whom you are in enmity. God is All-Powerful, and God is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"God does not forbid you, as regards those who do not make war against you on account of your Religion, nor drive you away from your homes, to be kindly to them, and act towards them with equity.

When believing women come to you as emigrants, test them, (though only) God knows best their faith. Then, if you have ascertained that they are believers, do not return them to the unbelievers. They are not (being believers) lawful (as wives) for the unbelievers nor are the unbelievers lawful (as husbands) for them. But return to them (the unbelievers) whatever they expended (by way of bridal-due when they wed those women). And there will be no blame on you (O believers) if you marry them when you have given them their bridal-due. Also, (on the other side) do not continue to retain disbelieving women in marriage, and ask for the return of whatever you expended as their bridal-due (if they remain among or join the unbelievers), just as the disbelieving men (whose wives have emigrated to you after embracing Islam) have the right to demand the return of whatever they spent. That is Godâ€™s judgment and His law; He lays down the law and judges between you. God is All-Knowing, All-Wise"},{"SurahNumber":60,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"If anything of the bridal-dues of your (former) disbelieving wives (who remain among or have joined the unbelievers) has passed to the unbelievers, and afterwards you have your turn (of victory) over them, then pay to those whose wives have gone away the equivalent of what they expended (as bridal-due). And keep from disobedience to God in reverence for Him and piety, in Whom you are believers"}]}
