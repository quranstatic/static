Then it becomes thick, standing firmly on its stem, to the delight of the planters—in this way God makes the believers a source of dismay for the disbelievers. To those of them who believe and do good, God has promised forgiveness and a great reward"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O believers!
