(They use pun and play upon words. They pretend to say, ´we heard and we obeyed´, and ´wait, we did not hear´. Instead, with a twist of their tongue, they make it sound (as if they said), \"We heard and we disobeyed\", and \"Listen, may you go deaf!\" and ´Raina´ _ (an insult in Hebrew). Thus, they slander the (true) faith. It would have been much better for them and more upright, had they said, \"We heard and we obey\" and \"Listen to us, and be patient with us\". Because of their disbelief, Allah has cursed them! Little is what they believe"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":47,"Text":"Oh you who were given the scriptures (earlier)! Believe in the revelation We have sent (to Muhammad, SAW), confirming your earlier scriptures. Believe it, before We (distort and) blot out your faces and make them reel backwards.
