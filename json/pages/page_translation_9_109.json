Enter it (not through different ways with the aim of plundering and massacring its people but) through its gate humbly and in utmost submission to God. Say words of imploring forgiveness and loyalty to Him, that We forgive you your misdeeds.\" We will increase the reward for those devoted to doing good, aware that God is seeing them"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":59,"Text":"Then those who persisted in wrongdoing changed what had been said to them (regarding humility, imploring forgiveness, submission, and loyalty) for another saying (and so acted contrarily to how they had been ordered.) So We sent down upon those who did wrong a scourge from heaven because they were continually transgressing"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":60,"Text":"Again (remember) when Moses (on an occasion when his people were without water in the desert) beseeched water for his people, so We told him: \"Strike the rock with your staff!\" (As soon as he struck) there gushed forth from it twelve springs. Each tribe knew their drinking place. Eat and drink of that which God has provided, and do not go about acting wickedly on earth, causing disorder and corruption"},{"SurahNumber":2,"VerseNumber":61,"Text":"And (remember the time) when you said: \"Moses, we will no longer be able to endure one sort of food. Pray for us to your Lord, that He may bring forth for us of all that the soil produces – its green herbs, and its cucumbers, and its corn, and its lentils, and its onions.\" He (Moses) responded: \"Would you have in exchange what is meaner for what is better? Get you down to Egypt (or some city); surely there is for you there what you ask for.\" So in the end ignominy and misery were pitched upon them, and they earned wrath (a humiliating punishment) from God. That was because they were persistently disbelieving in Our Revelations and rejecting Our signs (despite continuously observing them in their lives), and killing the Prophets against all right and truth. That was because they disobeyed and kept on exceeding the bounds (of the Law)"}]}
