When any of you men divorce your wives, divorce them with regard to their waiting period. And keep proper count of the period, and fear Allah, your Lord. Drive them not out of their homes [during the waiting period], nor should they themselves leave unless they openly commit an immoral act. And these are the bounds set by Allah. He who transgresses Allah's bounds, wrongs himself. You never know, Allah may well bring about some new situation after that"},{"SurahNumber":65,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Then when their waiting term gets over, either retain them [as wives] honourably or part with them in fair manner. Call to witness two reliable men from among you and keep your testimony upright for Allah. This admonition is given to one who believes in Allah and the Last Day. And one who fears Allah, He will make for him a way out [of his difficulties]"},{"SurahNumber":65,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"And Allah will provide for him [who fears Him] from an unexpected source.

He who fears Allah, he shall have his evil deeds effaced from him and the reward enriched for him"}]}
