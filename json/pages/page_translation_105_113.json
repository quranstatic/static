Do not say (that Allah is) three! Desist! It is better for you (if you desist). Verily, Allah is (only) One. He is (too glorified and) too exalted to have a son. Everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to Him. Allah suffices as a Disposer of all matters and things! (He needs no mediator)"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":172,"Text":"Never was (Jesus) the Messiah, too arrogant to be treated as the created servant of Allah, nor are the angels who are the closest (to Allah).
