Those who are with him are firm and strict with those who suppress the truth, but compassionate towards one another. You see them bowing and prostrating to seek favours from Allah and His pleasure. Their distinguishing marks — the results of their [frequent] prostrations — are on their faces. They are likened in the Torah and in the Gospel to a seed which sends out its shoot and then strengthens it. It then becomes thick, and stands firm on its own stem, delighting the farmers. [Allah has so developed the character of believers] to enrage, through them, those who suppress the Truth. Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward to those of them who believe and do good deeds"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O you who believe! Do not push yourself forward in the presence of Allah and his Messenger, and fear Allah. Allah does indeed hear all, know all"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the Prophet's voice, nor speak loudly to him as you speak loudly to one another, lest your deeds become unwittingly worthless"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Those indeed who lower their voices before Allah's Messenger — they are those whose minds Allah has tested for piety.
