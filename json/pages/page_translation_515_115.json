When you see them, you will find them making Rakuh (bowing down) and Sajud (prostrate in prayers), and craving for the blessings from Allah and His good pleasure. They have the marks of Sajud (prostration) on their foreheads, the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Torah; and their similitude in the Gospel: they are like the seed which puts forth its sprout, then strengthens it, then becomes thick and stands firmly on its stem, delighting the sowers of the seed, so that through them He may enrage the unbelievers. Yet to those of them who will believe and do good deeds, Allah has promised forgiveness and a great reward"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O believers! Do not put yourselves ahead of Allah and His Messenger. Fear Allah; surely Allah hears all and knows all"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"O believers! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor speak aloud when talking to him as you speak aloud to one another, lest your deeds should come to nothing while you do not even perceive it"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Those who lower their voices and speak softly in the presence of Allahâ€™s Messenger are the ones whose hearts Allah has tested for piety; they shall have forgiveness and a great reward"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"Those who call out to you, O Muhammad, from outside the private apartments, most of them lack common sense"}]}
