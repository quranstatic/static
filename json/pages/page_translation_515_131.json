This is their description in Torah; and their description in Injil is: like a sown crop that brings forth its shoot, then makes it strong, then it grows thick and stands straight on its stem, looking good to the farmers, so that He may enrage the disbelievers through them. Allah has promised forgiveness and a huge reward to those of them who believe and do good deeds"},{"SurahNumber":49,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O you who believe, do not proceed ahead of Allah and His Messenger, and fear Allah.
