Therefore, read of it - the Quran - as much as will put you at ease, and perform your prayers and give alms, for alms are but the vehicles of prayer. Also lend Allah all you can of your benevolence, and whatever you advance of piety toward future security, you shall find it in heaven's realm of such a value that it reimburses you what is indeed profitable and really rewarding and invoke Allah's forgiveness; Allah is indeed Ghaforun (Forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O you who are garbed from head to foot in heavy cloth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Rise and warn the people of neglecting their duties toward Allah"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Advance the glory of Allah and ascribe glory in adoration to His Name"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"Cleanse your clothes and your heart and mind and imprint your deeds with wisdom and piety and resolution"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"Refuse to recognize idolatry and things not pertaining to Allah, so that you be free from spiritual and moral pollution"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"Do not give, expecting to take more than what you have given"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"and in the cause of Allah exercise patience and bear with others their faults, for in patience possess you your soul"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"For when finally the h trumpet is sounded"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"Then it is a momentous Day of heavy consequence, a Day of constraint and constriction"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"So distressful to those who refused to acknowledge Allah and conform to His blessed will; a day fraught with pain and affliction"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Now leave to Me the one whom I brought into being and ushered him into this world helpless, empty, with no progeny and never less alone than when he was alone"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"Then in affluence did I accord him wealth and abounding resources"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"and a progeny by his side, who would bear witness to the considerable position he enjoys and the will he enforces"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"I made him lead an easy life with success and prosperity wherever he set his courses"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"But his greed is never satisfied and he has always asked for more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"Yet how obstinate to Our signs, revelations and ordinances he has been; holding no opinions but they held him and reign in his core"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":17,"Text":"Such persons I will afflict with endless calamities and make the like unable to hold his own"}]}
