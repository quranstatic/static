You can see that His Laws govern the heavens and the earth.

It is your duty to enjoin the Right and forbid the Wrong, since you accept the Final Word of God as the Criterion (3:4).

Now if the People of the Scripture had attained this kind of belief, it would have been for their own good. But only few among them are believers, while most of them are drifting away from the Truth"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":111,"Text":"If you truly become worthy of the title of \"The Best Suited Community\" your opponents would scarcely do a trifling harm and if they come to battle against you, they would flee quickly and find no help"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":112,"Text":"Humiliated are they wherever they may be, unless they grasp a bond with God, and a bond with the people. They have incurred displeasure of God, and are committed to disgrace.

All this, because they rebelled, and persisted in transgressing the bounds of what is right"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":113,"Text":"Not all the People of the Scripture are alike.

They advocate what Allah has decreed as virtuous, and forbid what Allah has decreed as vice. They try to lead in acts of social benefit; such are the ones who augment the human potential"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":115,"Text":"No benevolent actions of this kind shall go un-rewarded.
