He knows that you cannot keep an accurate count of it, so He has shown mercy to you. So now recite as much of the Qur´an as you can. He knows that there are among you those who are sick and others who are journeying in the land in quest of Allah´s bounty, and still others who are fighting in the cause of Allah. So recite as much of the Qur´an as you easily can, and establish Prayer, and pay Zakah, and give Allah a goodly loan. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you shall find it with Allah. That is better and its reward is greater. And ask for Allah´s forgiveness; surely He is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O you enveloped in your cloak"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Arise, and warn"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"and magnify the glory of your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"and purify your robes"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"and shun uncleanness"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"and bestow not favour in order to seek from others a greater return"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"and persevere for your Lord´s sake"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"When the Trumpet shall be sounded"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"that will surely be a hard day"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"not an easy day for the unbelievers"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Leave Me with him whom I alone have created"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"whom I have endowed with abundant riches"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"and sons ever present with him"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"and for whom I have smoothed the way (to power and riches)"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"and who still greedily desires that I should bestow upon him more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"By no means; he is stubbornly opposed to Our Signs"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":17,"Text":"I shall soon constrain him to a hard ascent"}]}
