Indeed He who revived it shall bring the dead back to life. He is indeed Qadiron (Omnipotent.) over all things"},{"SurahNumber":41,"VerseNumber":40,"Text":"Those who corrupt Our revelations and distort them from their intended purpose and meaning are not hidden from Us nor is their motive unknown to Us. But then, is he who is cast into Hell fire better or he who comes back in Day of Judgment actuated with the feeling of security? You -infidels- just proceed as you have begun if you will; He is indeed Bassirun (Omnipresent Who sees all that you do)"},{"SurahNumber":41,"VerseNumber":41,"Text":"Indeed, those who declared the Quran, when it was revealed to them, to be untrue and untenable and not what it is stated to be, shall regret their declaration. It is indeed a Book enjoying the majesty and splendour attendant upon a manifestation of Allah"},{"SurahNumber":41,"VerseNumber":42,"Text":"A Book that is not open to falsehood, past, present or ever nor from any aspect. Even if assailed, its inherent power and operative influence are never hurt; it is a disclosure of knowledge, wisdom, and guidance authoritatively revealed by Him, Who is Hakimun (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations), and Hamidun (Worthy of all praise)"},{"SurahNumber":41,"VerseNumber":43,"Text":"Nothing is said to you O Muhammad by your opponents who call you everything they could lay their tongues to that was not said to Messengers sent before you. Indeed Allah, your Creator, has on hand mercy and forgiveness and He has on hand also condign punishment"},{"SurahNumber":41,"VerseNumber":44,"Text":"Had We made it a Quran in a literary form that is ambiguous, un understandable and foreign to their thoughts, they would have said: \"If only its revelations and precepts were expounded so that We could apprehend the intended tense!\" How is it that We render it in a literary form foreign to people's thoughts when it is addressed to an Arab! Say to them :. \" It -the Quran- is the spirit of truth guiding those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand into all truth. Its inherent heavenly power exerts a remedying effect on their minds to counteract doubt and redress uncertainties; whereas to those who deny it, and their heart's ears are deaf, it exerts a blinding effect on their intellectual and spiritual perception. These are they who seem to be called upon from afar as the earth's distant ends; they are also distant from Allah's blessed abode"},{"SurahNumber":41,"VerseNumber":45,"Text":"We gave Mussa (Moses) the Book AL-Tawrah (the Torah) and there it was met with disagreement; it was not in accordance with some of his people's taste and liking; it excited their displeasure and disgust. And had it not been for Allah's Word proclaimed beforehand to put punishment of your opponents O Muhammad in respite, their Hereafter would have been planted in the now. They are in perplexity about it -the Quran- with suspicions amongst their thoughts"},{"SurahNumber":41,"VerseNumber":46,"Text":"He who imprints his deeds with wisdom and piety, advantages himself of spiritual privileges, and he who weds himself to evil, invites his own detriment and loss, and never is Allah, your Creator, unjust to His servants"}]}
