{"Id":133,"LanguageCodes":["en","eng"],"Name":"eng-mustafakhattabg","Author":"Mustafa Khattab God Edition","Language":"English","Description":"English","Direction":"ltr","Source":"","Translations":[{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Forbidden to you are carrion, blood, and swine; what is slaughtered in the name of any other than God; what is killed by strangling, beating, a fall, or by being gored to death; what is partly eaten by a predator unless you slaughter it; and what is sacrificed on altars. You are also forbidden to draw lots for decisions. This is all evil. Today the disbelievers have given up all hope of ˹undermining˺ your faith. So do not fear them; fear Me! Today I have perfected your faith for you, completed My favour upon you, and chosen Islam as your way. But whoever is compelled by extreme hunger—not intending to sin—then surely God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"They ask you, ˹O Prophet,˺ what is permissible for them ˹to eat˺. Say, “What is good and lawful. Also what is caught by your hunting animals and birds of prey which you have trained as instructed by God. So eat what they catch for you, but mention the Name of God over it ˹first˺.” And be mindful of God. Surely God is swift in reckoning"},{"SurahNumber":5,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"Today all good, pure foods have been made lawful for you. Similarly, the food of the People of the Book is permissible for you and yours is permissible for them. And ˹permissible for you in marriage˺ are chaste believing women as well as chaste women of those given the Scripture before you—as long as you pay them their dowries in wedlock, neither fornicating nor taking them as mistresses. And whoever rejects the faith, all their good deeds will be void ˹in this life˺ and in the Hereafter they will be among the losers"}]}
