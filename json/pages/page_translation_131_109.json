Rather, they say this because what they used to hide (the manifest truth, and their own evil intentions, intrigues, and actions in response to it) has become obvious to them; and if they were brought back to the world, they would revert to the very thing they were forbidden: indeed, they are just liars"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":29,"Text":"(They always behaved so whenever they got into distress while in the world, but when relieved of it) they would say: \"There is no life beyond our present life of the world, and we are not to be raised (from the dead)"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":30,"Text":"But if you could see when they are made to stand in their Lord’s Presence: He says: \"Is not this (your being raised from the dead and gathered in My Presence) the truth?\" They say: \"Yes indeed, by our Lord!\" He says: \"Taste, then, the punishment for what you used to disbelieve"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":31,"Text":"Assuredly, those have lost who deny the (truth of the final) meeting with God until, as the Hour comes upon them all of a sudden, they cry, \"Alas for us! how negligent we have been in this regard,\" when they have already loaded their burdens on to their backs .

We know indeed that the things (lies, mockery, and slanders) that they say grieve you: yet, it is not you that they deny (they cannot very well call you a liar since they themselves have called you ‘the trustworthy one’); rather, it is the signs and Revelations of God that the wrongdoers obstinately reject"},{"SurahNumber":6,"VerseNumber":34,"Text":"(Do not be grieved at what they do!)
