She has secured from you a firm commitment"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":22,"Text":"Do not wed the women, whom your father (or grandfather) had married. But whatever has already happened (in the past), has happened. That is indeed a lewd deed, an abominable act, a profane practice"},{"SurahNumber":4,"VerseNumber":23,"Text":"Forbidden for you to marry are: your mothers, your daughters and your sisters, your father´s and your mother´s sisters, your brothers´ and sisters´ daughters, your foster mothers (that is, any women) who (may) have breast fed you, and the foster sisters who have shared the breast milk with you. (Also forbidden are) the mothers of your wives, and the stepdaughters under your care from your wives with whom you have had conjugal relations. But if you did not consummate the marriage (before you divorced her), then there is no sin (for you to marry her daughter). It is forbidden for you to marry the wives of your (biological) sons (that is, those who spring) from your loin. (It is forbidden) for you to gather two sisters in wedlock at the same time. But whatever has happened (in the past), has happened. Allah is the most Forgiving and the most Merciful"}]}
