In fact it was the blasphemers who defied Allah. They taught people necromancy which they practised through contact with evil spirits and through the knowledge they acquired from revelations imparted to the two angelic Babylonians Harut and Marut. But Harut and Marut made it clear that their art was a source of temptation and an incitement to evil and they cautioned against indulgence as it meant defiance to Allah. Yet those blasphemers pursued the evil aspect of this art using those spirits to sow discord between husband and wife and other similar evil acts. Nonetheless no one suffers harm unless divinely predetermined. They applied themselves to learning the art which inflicts harm upon them and they derive no profit from it.
