They ask, “Do we have a say in the matter?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “All matters are destined by God.” They conceal in their hearts what they do not reveal to you. They say ˹to themselves˺, “If we had any say in the matter, none of us would have come to die here.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Even if you were to remain in your homes, those among you who were destined to be killed would have met the same fate.” Through this, God tests what is within you and purifies what is in your hearts. And God knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":155,"Text":"Indeed, those ˹believers˺ who fled on the day when the two armies met were made to slip by Satan because of their misdeeds. But God has pardoned them. Surely God is All-Forgiving, Most Forbearing"},{"SurahNumber":3,"VerseNumber":156,"Text":"O believers! Do not be like the unfaithful who say about their brothers who travel throughout the land or engage in battle, “If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.” God makes such thinking a cause of agony in their hearts.
