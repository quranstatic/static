God designed the night and the day. He knows that you are unable to sustain it, so He has pardoned you. So read of the Quran what is possible for you. He knows that some of you may be ill; and others travelling through the land, seeking God's bounty; and others fighting in God's cause. So read of it what is possible for you, and observe the prayers, and give regular charity, and lend God a generous loan. Whatever good you advance for yourselves, you will find it with God, better and generously rewarded. And seek God's forgiveness, for God is Forgiving and Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O you Enrobed one"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Arise and warn"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"And magnify your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"And purify your clothes"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"And abandon abominations"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"And show no favor seeking gain"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"And be constant for your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"When the Trumpet is blown"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"That Day will be a difficult day"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"For the disbelieversâ€”not easy"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Leave Me to him whom I created alone"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"And gave him vast wealth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"And children as witnesses"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"And smoothed things for him"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Then he wants Me to add yet more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"By no means!
