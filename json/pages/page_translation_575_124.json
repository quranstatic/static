And Allah determines the duration of the night and of the day. He knows that you will not be able to keep count of it [your night vigil], so He has turned to you in mercy. Read [study], then, as much of the Qur'aan as is easy for you. He knows that some among you would be sick and some others would be travelling in search of Allah's bounty [livelihood], and yet others would be fighting for the cause of Allah. So, read, then as much of it [Qur'aan] as is easy for you. And establish the prayer, pay the Zakaat, and give Allah a good loan. And the good deed you send in advance for your souls, you will find it with Allah. That is better and greater in reward. And seek Allah's forgiveness! Allah is indeed Forgiving, Merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O you folded up [in inactivity]"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"Arise and warn"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"And proclaim the greatness of your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"And keep your garments clean"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"And shun the dirt"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"And expect no [material] gain [for your own self]"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"And, for your Lord, be patient"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"And [warn that] when the Trumpet is blown"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"That Day [the day when the Trumpet is blown] will be a difficult day"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"Not [at all] an easy day for those who suppress the Truth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Leave to Me what I Myself created [human being] without any help from anyone else"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"And I created for him resources in abundance"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"And children present by his side"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"And I made things easy for him"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"Yet he is greedy for more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"Nay!
