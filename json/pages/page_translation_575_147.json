God determines the measure of night and day. He knows that you will not be able to do it, so He has turned to you in mercy. Recite, then, as much of the Quran as is easy for you. He knows that there will be some among you who may be sick and others who will be travelling throughout the land seeking God's bounty, and yet others who may be fighting for the cause of God. So, recite, then as much of it as you are able, and be constant in prayer, and spend in charity, and give to God a goodly loan. For whatever good deed you send on before you for your souls, you will find it with God. It will be improved and richly rewarded by Him. Seek God's forgiveness, He is most forgiving, most merciful"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":1,"Text":"O, you, wrapped in your cloak"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":2,"Text":"arise and give warning"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":3,"Text":"Proclaim the glory of your Lord"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":4,"Text":"purify your garments"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":5,"Text":"shun uncleanness"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":6,"Text":"do not bestow a favour in the expectation of receiving more in return"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":7,"Text":"and for the sake of your Lord, be patient"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":8,"Text":"When the Trumpet is sounded"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":9,"Text":"that Day will be a hard and distressing Day"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":10,"Text":"It will not be easy for those who deny the truth"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":11,"Text":"Leave Me alone [to deal] with him whom I have created alone"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":12,"Text":"and to whom I have granted resources in abundance"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":13,"Text":"and sons to be by his side"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":14,"Text":"and whom I have provided with every resource"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":15,"Text":"and yet, he greedily desires that I give him even more"},{"SurahNumber":74,"VerseNumber":16,"Text":"By no means!
