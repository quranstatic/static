God is Watchful over all things"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":53,"Text":"O you who believe! Do not enter the homes of the Prophet, unless you are given permission to come for a meal; and do not wait for its preparation. And when you are invited, go in. And when you have eaten, disperse, without lingering for conversation. This irritates the Prophet, and he shies away from you, but God does not shy away from the truth. And when you ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and their hearts. You must never offend the Messenger of God, nor must you ever marry his wives after him, for that would be an enormity with God"},{"SurahNumber":33,"VerseNumber":54,"Text":"Whether you declare a thing, or hide it, God is Aware of all things"}]}
